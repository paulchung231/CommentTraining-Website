The attempted rapes of Claire and Jenny didn't even come close to breaking them. Claire (we know know from reading the books) certainly felt violated, but she was more disturbed by the fact she had killed a man than that he had attempted to rape her. <br/><br/>BJR broke Jamie's spirit with the perversity of his utter brutality on the one hand and his tenderness on the other. It was diabolical what he did to him; he wanted to make Jamie unable to ever forget him and what happened between then. To forever see his face whenever he closed his eyes. It wasn't ""just"" rape (and I do not in any way think rape is ""just"" anything); to be subjected to what Jamie endured is, IMHO (admittedly never having had either experience), much worse than having your clothes ripped off and ALMOST penetrated by a stinking man.<br/><br/>So I wasn't really bothered by the fact they didn't dwell on Claire's recovery from her near rape. She, and Jenny for that matter, never felt they were so shamed by the experience that they wished for death. So, no, two episodes for Jamie to ""recover"" from his experience wasn't at all too much. I would have liked for them to have followed the book a little more when Claire tries to ""go into the dark with him"", it was a far more intense experience in the book and it is the only time I have felt at all let down by the show.

1433144106,,http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/last-exit-before-chaos/,Very well put. We need somehow to attack the oligarchs and not attack the people. I believe the first step is to give the public knowledge. The oligarchs were just trying to make money on lending money by any means necessary. They were focused on short-term profits independent of the debt condition we now have many years later. The first step in attacking them and holding them accountable is to just to educate the public as to who actually caused this problem. It certainly wasn't misconduct by the Greek people or the German people. It was misconduct by German bankers and oligarchs with the acquiescence at least of the Greek and Spanish governments. I say take these assets back from the actual people who conducted the predatory lending: German and Greek and Spanish oligarchs: the politically privileged.

I remember the  frustration of my then 14 year old who, under the teacher's strict orders, was only allowed to read YA books for her English class for two years. She had read most of the good ones already and wasn't allowed to read something she had already read. It was torture. I was both proud and ashamed to read one of her essays at that time. In it she described her love of reading and her early conviction that there was no such thing as a bad book. That was the year she realized that her early readings had been guided and curated by her book loving mother.  It wasn't that there were no bad books, she had just been steered clear of them. Now she was being forced to read inferior, bad, cringe worthy books to fulfill YA or Dutch author reading requirements. She survived though and her ability to compare and contrast literature served her well. To graduate she had to read and discuss in an oral exam 15 literature novels (each) in Dutch, English and French. <br/><br/>Contrast her experience with my youngest daughter who has not been an enthusiastic reader -- until she found Wattpad, and fan fiction.   It kills me to read some of  it, most of it is so poorly written.  At least she's reading?? Not sure.

One requires daily dose (i.e., constant, long-term exposure of nervous system to powerful drugs), creates dependency (I would say addiction, though there are technical quibbles with that), can cause tardive dysphoria (see my above post), have a range of other nasty side-effects, are tough to get off of, tend to blunt human emotions, serve as major profit centers for big pharma, and tend to help people conform to the system.  The other involves periodic and limited use, has virtually no side effects, is anti-addictive (Bill Wilson, founder of AA, argued for psychedelics as part of their regimen), cannot be pattended and so does nothing for big pharma, opens people up to beauty and love, helps heal trauma, and encourages people to think freely and expand their horizons.  There IS NO single miracle cure and psychedelics need to be used carefully and in a supportive life context, but for me it has been a no-brainer.

This was particularly so in Jerusalem and Hebron.  When they came to join their co-religionists in greater numbers later in the 1800's and 1900's - well before the Holocaust, and the Balfour Declaration was well before the Holocaust as was the League of Nation mandate in the 1920's - they didn't come with guns and armies.   They came legally under laws then existing in a province of the Ottoman Empire and later under the (lawful) British Mandate.<br/><br/>And unlike the expansion of Anglo-Saxon civilization into North America, they paid for the land they acquired with fair value.<br/><br/>So if we're going to talk about an unrelated event in the context of the American settlement of the West, let's at least get the facts straight.<br/><br/>As for the thesis in this piece, the moral drama implicit in freeing the slaves seems separate to me from Western settlement and the Indian Wars.  For one thing, thousands of Indians fought in the Civil War and of course their contest with white settlement - and often with each other - long predates the Indian Wars.

In this recovery, such as it is, we have relied almost exclusively on monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus being blocked for both partisan reasons and philosophical reasons, the effect of which has been to restore inequality to the pre-crisis level, setting us up again for another crisis; monetary stimulus and fiscal stimulus are both redistributive, the difference being that the former is redistributive upward - the point of monetary stimulus is to inflate the value of financial assets, and the clerk at Walmart doesn't own any. Here's an irony: economists of the Austrian school, often ridiculed by Krugman, wouldn't implement either fiscal stimulus or monetary stimulus, and would just let the chips fall where they may, the effect of which would be very painful but would correct excessive inequality.

However, I think we continue to muddle the complexity of war experience and its consequences.<br/><br/>WWII is probably the last major war with black and white causes and effects. Even so, many black soldiers and women did not get their due credit until quite recently.<br/><br/>The key is due credit. No more and no less. And indeed, a good friend of mine went to Vietnam fresh out of high school, without waiting for the draft, because he experienced family issues. Despite the attitude of veterans at the time, he actually became a better man after the experience. That doesn't mean his problems were over. Far from it. But some of his problems predated the war experience. Even so, he should receive any help available to him as a veteran or simply as a citizen should he require it. <br/><br/>On the other hand, we have heard of all kind of disability abuses by first responders like that of the NYC case not long ago. <br/><br/>However, appreciation is the most important but also the least expensive support we can offer to our veterans. Mind you, a lot of these got enough right out of high school. They are not West Point graduates. So, their development, however sped up by the war experience, is just the beginning. They are the future leaders. Instead of just giving them meds, the best way is to help them develop themselves into a better human being.

While service is important and should be respected, many vets (including me) never came anywhere near a battle. Even during WWII many, many vets served state-side never going overseas at all. In the service one goes where sent and does the job one is ordered to do. The service is honorable and is, indeed, service to country. That said, it is reasonable to set limits not only on how disability is decided, but also on how medical care is accessed. The system of asking vets who can afford it to pay part of their medical care expense is a good one and should be expanded.

Thus when there is a large balance of trade deficit, like for the U.S., it's a sign the wealthy class is taking too much.

The warrants are available later for public review because they are in the police record or in the court record. <br/><br/>The other issue that I think is not focused on enough is the question of clear limits to the use of surveillance techniques. Congress should not permit limitless surveillance. Instead, there should be a clear requirement, set forth in the statute, of some reasonable basis for individualized suspicion. Probable cause is too much to ask, but there must be a less demanding standard that still provides some privacy protection.",,,<br/>,comment,1433132867,,,,,,,,approved,,1433159219,CastleMan,,Colorado,NULL,NULL

The wisdom of setting up multi-tribal countries that became dictatorships likely did prevent wars but the remnants of tribal hatreds survived because the dictatorships did not have the foresight to teach tolerance of diversity.  In fact, dictatorships almost always are corrupt family enterprises that perpetuate tribalism rather that pluralistic entities that seek the good of all of its citizens.<br/>I am afraid that the Muslim world's warring factions will not quiet until enough of their combatants deplete their gene pool of violent tendenies. Those preferring peace will escape, become refugees, if they survive ISIS. Those preferring to fight will gradually become decimated. Interesting is that those who can tolerate the swings in religious oversight may be the survivors....i.e., those with tepid tolerance. The saddest part of the process are the raped women, many of whom will be scarred for life.

That gives us approximately .01010001..... Each subsequent generation adds a digit farther to the right of the decimal. Yes, there's a small probability of dying out at each generation, but those probabilities form a series that converges to a probability well below 1. <br/><br/>For smaller values of p &gt; .5, it's not as overwhelming, but the idea is the same: the population size m grows exponentially. The probability of dying out is 1/(1-p)^m, and if you add those probabilities up the series converges to a number less than 1.",,,<br/>,userReply,1433160500,,,,,,,,approved,,1433160548,D-Ferg,,"Norwalk, CT",NULL,NULL

There seems to have always been extreme tax-evasion, in part, due to a lack of confidence in a government filled with cronies and corruption.

For example, because the Duggers were not attending conventional schools, they couldn't get to know a teacher or a friends' parent or anyone else they could turn to for help.<br/><br/>- In at least some subcultures, there does not seem to be a consensus that abuse of children is wrong.

When word got out that Refco had caught a bad break, overnight lenders stopped taking Refco's calls. Three years later, overnight lenders stopped taking Lehman's calls and the same thing happened again. The facts weren't identical: Refco used customer segregated funds to collateralize some repo, while Lehman committed no similar breach.

If candidates aren't going about the business of getting on ballots in time, or if they lack the infrastructure to win substantial numbers of primaries, I don't need their ""ideas"".)<br/><br/>I also disagree because what candidates SAY they ""would do"" as President is fairly meaningless.

I'd prefer analysis of what they have done, what their team members have done, and what they can credibly achieve.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I heartily agree that the phrase "" ...

For now The Times has made judgment calls about who gets what. Mitt Romney, Perry, Gingrich and Cain all have a beat reporter assigned to their campaigns, while the rest of the field gets what Mr. Stevenson calls “zone coverage.”<br/>The Times was stuck taking, in turns, Michelle Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, all the while managing to ignore Ron Paul, the only candidate in 2012 with the potential to draw young voters. This year, the Times doubled down and assigned a dedicated beat reporter, Amy Chozick, to Hillary Clinton as she LEFT public service. And how many other potential candidates received such coverage? Yes, it's ZERO. And just today, an article in the Times shows that it is shocked and astonished that Bernie Sanders is attracting large, excited crowds in Iowa.

Now he's suggesting that the possibility of a default and exit from the Euro of a country that represents less than 2% of European GDP poses a similar threat to European economic and social stability as a war that involved five of the major world empires at the time, killed 20 million people, and arguably in its consequences was the pivotal event of the 20th Century. In fact it's the continuing Greek soap opera that is creating instability albeit it relatively minor. Markets have largely shrugged because they know the danger of contagion is small. Au fond Krugman wants, as he always has, to give the Greeks a waiver in return for nothing so that the dysfunctional Greek economy can just return to business as usual. I don't think this is going to happen and it shouldn't.

OTOH, if they go with Grexit, then according to PK, Greece recovery is fore ordained because the only real problems here are macro in nature. In this scenario, the VSPs get discredited. <br/><br/>So, PK should be for Grexit then, more efficient solution for Greece, and it will nail the VSPs. And I think using the above logic, the VSPs too would rather Grexit than having to face Pademos, Syriza Portugal, Syriza Italia etc, in very short order. At least in the Grexit case, if PK is correct, the day of reckoning is further in the future. <br/><br/>This story is hard to buy though, if the Greeks thought it were true why are they fighting so hard to stay in? More fundamentally, they WILL have to face hard structural adjustments. In part that is what devaluation helps with by adjusting all price levels in the economy, allowing reallocation within the economy of value as productive prices (Ionian hoteliers) rise faster than less productive prices (bloated government ministry workers). To the extent they try to counteract this natural law through the same behaviors that got them unto the mess, the adjustment will fail, even if they devalued.

There are respectable, informed economists who reason that reversion may be both inevitable and necessary. It would for sure have large immediate impacts on Greece, but whether it would have a longer-term destructive or destabilizing effect on the rest of the international financial system is really not so self-evident. I agree, however, there is a ""1914 Feeling"" about all of this, but not because the parties to the negotiations are naive or unaware of where they are heading; rather, they are operating from very different political imperatives and have contradictory theories - and self-confidence -  about the prospective effectiveness of the policy options each are pursuing.",,,<br/>,comment,1433163189,,,,,,,,approved,,1433163249,Mark,,Canada,NULL,NULL

The probability of splitting is p. As a function of p, what is the probability that a single bacterium will produce an everlasting colony?""<br/><br/>Instead of defining q as the probability that the colony lasts forever, define q(k) as the probability that the colony lasts (at least) k generations.  Much as is described in Post #10_1, we can solve for q(k) recursively: q(0)=1; q(k) = p[1 - (1-q(k-1))^2].  That is, a bacterium survives for k generations only if it splits and it is not the case that both of the daughter cells fail to survive for k-1 generations.  We can try values of p&gt;1/2 and observe that the sequence q(0), q(1), ... appears to converge to 2-1/p rather than to 0.<br/><br/>To check the convergence rigorously, we look at the derivative of q(k) with respect to q(k-1), evaluated at each of the two possible stationary points 0 and 2-1/p.  If the absolute value of the derivative is less than 1.0 then it is a stable stationary point, which sequences can converge to.  If the absolute value is greater than 1.0 then it is an unstable stationary point.  Evaluating the derivative we see that 2-1/p is stable and 0 is unstable when p&gt;1/2.

Things must be either this way or that way, no thought of the possibility of a merger.  This happens in the ""hard sciences"" too, of course, but many reasonable scientists, hearing an argument that things must be either A or B, ask, ""Why not both?""  The issue is not whether one idea or another holds absolutely, but how they are to be weighted in combination.  (And the weighting changes in different circumstances.)  In Paul Romer's piece on ""mathiness"": ""As scientists, we have to hold ourselves to a standard that requires us to reach a consensus about which model is right...""  Note  the Manichaean insistence that one must be right and the other must be wrong.  He doesn't even raise the possibility that both models may have something to contribute.  Later, talking about growth models: ""For growth theorists, the choice between price-taking and monopolistic competition is our version of the conflict between the geocentric and heliocentric models.""  It's telling that he picks as his metaphor two theories one of which is absolutely wrong.  That might be true in the economics case he cites, but I doubt it. My gut reaction is that it would be fun, and maybe highly useful, to devise ways to construct models that combine the two in some fashion.
