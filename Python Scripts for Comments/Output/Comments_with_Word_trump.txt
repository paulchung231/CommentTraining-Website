The phone company lacks the vast power of government. It cant issue an arrest warrant, it cant take away your civil rights, it cant make u disappear, assasinate u or put u in Guantanamo because of some trumped up charge against which u cannot have a jury of your peers, etc etc

I still don't understand: Europe gave Krugman its greatest honor, the Nobel Prize. So how come Europeans won't listen to him?<br/><br/>One of the most depressing lessons from this mess is that political expedience always trumps common sense. I'm sure many of the individual players would be happy to make the compromises necessary to keep the euro in Greece, but they're hamstrung by politics. Thus we will march toward destruction.

America's leaders during the GW Bush period learned nothing from the debacle of the Vietnam War.   They proceeded to do the same old thing in the same old way and expected a totally different result.   What they got was what we are watching and listening to on our TVs and media sources daily.<br/>We got into the Vietnam War on a trumped up lie about the Missouri being attacked in the gulf of Tonkin.  We were lied to and deceived and have a beautifully tragic monument with 58,000 names engraved on it to show the result of that lie.   We should have a monument to those who came back maimed in body and mind and spirit, but we haven't enough room to place it.<br/><br/>We were enticed into the Iraq War on a lie and exaggeration of 'maybes' and 'probablys' and outright greed and hutzpah.   And we lost this war also, even if we pretend we did not.   And we are to blame for ISIS and refuse to admit they are our own creation.   <br/><br/>No loving parent wants to see their child go back into that sand pit to fight for a country that is so divided it cannot even agree that the religion one holds -- Sunni/Shia./Kurdish or whatever is less important than banding together and making a peace filled country.   And no politician who claims to love their countrymen and women would ask them to do so.

Do you really think America's rogue agencies care what Congress authorizes?<br/><br/>Voyeurism and fear of the unknownable - aren't these drivers that trump any concerns about incomprehensible rules and laws, toothless enforcement and a corrupt and corruptible AG  and judiciary?

If the personal is going to trump politics in any meaningful way, it helps not to have an empty head. The US has a lot of catching up to do.

Roger, you see the death of  the political center in Greece, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands as one reason for the rise of, for example, anti-immigrant nationalists from Sweden to the Netherlands. <br/><br/>I am an American (citizen) who today on picking up my brand new Swedish passport suddenly feels empowered to say more about that "death of the political center" in Sweden.<br/><br/>The SD party with roots in Nazi ideology has risen to its present place in the Swedish parliament by proclaiming in part that it is the only party willing to talk about the costs and unintended consequences of Sweden's notably generous policy concerning refugees and their families. By doing this and by putting on sheep's clothing it has been quite successful in concealing its members' roots in the ideology I name.<br/><br/>The parties in power and those out of power do not seem yet to be able to formulate policy proposals to address these issues, perhaps in this way resembling the American situation as concerns undocumented immigrants.<br/><br/>However, at least in Sweden, in principle the country of good health, "Wellness does not trump politics". The percentage of Swedes on paid sick leave is greater than in any other country!<br/><br/><a href="http://Only-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com" title="Only-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Only-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com</a>

The monstrous rise of fascism after Weimar - the Holocaust and Hitler's reign of the Thousand Year Reich (cf 12 years, Die Dritte Reich) - do not seem distant to so many of us who still remember the entire world in chaos last century.  Social unrest today - the very rich controlling monies the world over - the poor struggling to live a life of low income, low prospects, low education - is bound for the kind of revolution that brought Fascism to the fore in Germany in 1933.  Our 21st Century social media world is ripe for revolution, is ruled by people skilled in the use of computers and handheld phones and digital widgets which control the minds of users, and sways thumb clickers towards their nefarious ethos.  As you say, Roger Cohen, wellness trumps politics these days, but we shall surely see the rise of virulent political ideology in our time - within the 17 months leading up to our Presidential elections.  Personal and spiritual health, the idolization of self, do not trump Earth's issues of climate warming and "uber" consumption of water and fossil fuels.  At least we do not yet need to fill wheelbarrows with worthless paper money to buy a loaf of bread (as the Germans did before the rise of  der fuhrer), and though there has never been such a thing as a totally bloodless revolution (though the fall of the USSR in 1989 came close), we in the West are looking at revolutionaries in the Middle East, whose unrest is beyond our ken these days. Berlin Redux.

Dugger-Hastert is about abusers who made political careers out of hypocrisy. Is protecting children a political issue? Of course not -- unless you're a Republican who trumpets "family values" to disguise your anti-family values like cutting funds for education, insisting that rape and abuse victims carry their pregnancies to term (might be your child!), and disguising their own sexuality while simultaneously making a political name for themselves by opposing equal rights for (other) gays while preaching the Truth Faith of evangelicals in Colorado Springs.  And yes, the GOP is the home of most of these hypocrites.

Insightful. Synopsis: Huxley ("Brave New World") trumps Orwell ("1984").

Love your columns but believe that what you are seeing strolling through the Tiergarten is middle class values trumping politics.<br/><br/>World War I eliminated the German middle class, heeding the call of the Kaiser emptied their savings to buy war bonds - worthless paper in 1918.<br/><br/>The poor had nothing to lose, and the rich were far  too sophisticated to fall for patriotic appeals.<br/><br/>What little was  left to the middle class was wiped out in the great  inflation of 1923.<br/><br/>After that it was the poor vs. the owners of capital.<br/><br/>A very faint, but troubling shade of that development can be seen in today's American politics where the middle class is hollowed out.

What were you thinking when you wrote this?  It doesn't come close to describing politics in the U.S. today, where conservatives have politicized everything:   "Most Westerners today are no longer driven by politics. By that I mean that they are no longer possessed by political ideas that they feel can change society. There is no great clash of ideologies. Politics in the 21st century has largely lost its capacity to inspire, or if there is a gust of inspiration (as with early Barack Obama) it proves illusory.<br/><br/>People are focused on other matters: personal health, spiritual health, wellness, diet, living longer, and the vast related matter of the health of the planet. Zen, yoga and the soul have trumped the means of production. Of course, wellness in turn raises the issues of climate change and energy consumption, questions that have considerable political content but are not political at their core. The political century has given way to the personal century.

And greed is trumping nationalism and is toppling economic security in any form.

While employed as an Assistant Public Defender in Cook County Illinois, I often encountered clients arrested for DWH (Driving While Hispanic), who had neither a driver's license, nor insurance. State laws prohibit issuing drivers' licenses, and thus obtaining insurance, to undocumented workers, who need to drive to get to work, drop the kids off at school and do the family shopping. This policy raised the cost of "uninsured motorist" coverage for all and endangered lives of the public on Illinois highways. For lack of a viable alternative, these clients had to take the risk of driving unlicensed and uninsured, as neither licenses, nor insurance, were available to them.<br/><br/>The purported reason for this policy was to avoid issuing identification documents to the undocumented, but nothing precludes issuing a limited  license marked "for driving purposes only and not to be recognized as identification for any other purpose." Such a limited license would allow these drivers to obtain necessary training and certification to drive, as well as obtain liability insurance. Most importantly, such limited licenses would enhance safety for all who use Illinois highways. Enhancing public safety on our roads should easily trump all other reasons for denying the undocumented limited drivers' licenses!

Whatever we're doing seems to not be working yet. Whatever the Iraqi army is doing certainly doesn't seem to be working. Do the Sunnis perhaps have ambivalent feelings about fighting Isis which may be why they're not really committed to the fight? They may in fact know or be related to many of the Isis fighters who are also Sunni. Perhaps their hatred of Shiites and Kurds is stronger than their fear of Isis? Perhaps they secretly agree with the idea of a Sunni caliphate? I don't know but it seems that may at least be a factor in why the Iraq army seems so incompetent.<br/>Things are so convoluted in the ME- you really never know who the true enemy is and you certainly don't know who your friends are. In fact, I think it's best to conclude the US has no friends in the ME. Tribal alliances trump all. Look at our so called friends in Saudi Arabia who spawned the 9/11 bombers and continue to fund madrassas that foment hatred of Western countries.<br/>Look at Syria where you have Assad fighting Isis but we blame Assad for the rise of Isis so we cannot form any alliances with him either- and rightly so since he's another ruthless, murdering dictator that we cannot align with.<br/>It's not possible to have a straightforward ME strategy since everyone hates everyone and there are so many factions- it's insane.<br/>I doubt whatever we do will work well for a long term solution. We might get temporary progress, but it will fall back to tribal loyalties in the end.

Here is how to cut skyrocketing disability payments: <br/><br/>Stop sending Americans to fight stupid wars--wars of invasion, trumped-up wars, unwinnable wars with no achievable political solution, and the all-time most ridiculous Bush-Cheney sales pitch of preemptive wars (plural wars of invasion accompanied by tax cuts).  <br/><br/>For what?  For the power and the glory of the enrichment of the military-industrial complex, ambitious career-making gung-ho military officers, and grandstanding politicians?   

16
Wellness Should trump politics, but a wish is not the way it is.  Politics is pure ego, who can get the best of another and survival of the fittest despite what a politician will tell you.  Wellness is what as humans we all need to share and can not survive without.  But survival of the fittest politics does not acknowledge or support  the sharing that is needed  to ensure that the little guy is not crushed.<br/><br/>Wellness is what is needed if opportunity for everyone is to thrive.  Wellness is about having enough good food, a clean place to live and adequate medical care, things that politics in this country do not support and this will be our downfall as a society.

In the Midwest of this rich country, where we live, the water supply of towns and cities is being threatened by the hog farms that proliferate all around.  In California crops that require abundant water are being irrigated as people fear for their own future drinking water supply.  At least we can still safely breathe  the air - according to the Times, residents of certain large cities in India and Asia are not so lucky.   But even here the raising of cheap food and the interest of large corporations  trump every other consideration.  It is not difficult  to become anxious: all one has to do is look at the facts.

What courage, Caitlyn! Bravo. As a gay man, I'm not surprised at the crass online judgments already piling up. Transphobia is real. Caitlyn's stance (somewhat similar to Laverne Cox's) at the powerful intersection of celebrity and bravery could very well save a young trans person's life - a trans teenager ready to kill themselves because they have zero support, and feel zero hope. Saving a life trumps someone else's discomfort with transgenderism. The last time I checked, there was a T in LGBT equality. Only good things for you, Caitlyn...and for every other trans person battling hatred, ignorance and violence.

19
We also SHOULD protect private property rights and those rights should trump religious issues. A&amp;F is private property and as such, should clearly be able to set the dress code required of their employees. Anyone who does not like the code does not have to work there.

"Zen, yoga and the soul have trumped the means of production. "<br/>You've got to be kidding.  Maybe in bubble lands like the upper east and west sides of NYC or parts of SF and LA. Even in Europe,  I doubt this trend is as<br/>far reaching as you think it is.  If it were, the human global should would be a lot better off than it is.<br/><br/>It's certainly  not in Waco.  No, the soul and yoga have not trumped anything in Waco. And  Waco is mot the only Waco. Unfortunately.

21
Sorry but I disagree completely. The Conservative movement, made manifest by the Republican party, is all ideology, all the time. That the implementation of their ideology devastates our economy, poisons our discourse, and holds hostage the wellness (literal and figurative) of our citizenry, including the very people who hold that ideology, does not seem to matter. For them, Politics trumps Wellness.

22
Great.  Athletics always trump academics.  A deficit is a deficit.  Maybe hire more adjuncts to subsidize the sports?

23
I can't really accept that, sorry. I don't think corporate power should trump individuals' deeply held beliefs.

24
Public expression of religion trumping wealth/education in terms of being  factor of insertion? I don't think African Americans would agree with you! Past is also relevant: intensity of previous traumas (colonialism, slavery) is also an essential factor. lastly, US Muslims immigrated to this country were for the most part supporters of US policies in the middle east and Africa.

25
This decision has it written, and rightly so, the death of the dress code, all over it. And let it be --freedom of an individual should trump corporate dress codes every time, unless safety is at stake. From flip flops at the White House to head scarfs, this signals a cultural change in the US as well.  

26
If I don't think business owners' rights should trump individuals' beliefs, is what you're saying still "common sense"? Isn't it really just "your sense"?

27
Define intent? Define religion? Define employee motivation? What passes for religious disposition? What if an individual decides to define a spanner in their ear as religion, is an employer culpable? If one is free to believe what they must, shouldn’t an employer also be free to define their own parameters? Or is religion the right to trump idealistic values/virtues over others and the presumption that if one questions my attire they are at the same time questioning my belief system and depriving me of my essence? <br/><br/><a href="http://scallywagandvagabond.com/2015/06/samantha-elauf-abercrombie-fitch-job-interview-wearing-hijab/" title="http://scallywagandvagabond.com/2015/06/samantha-elauf-abercrombie-fitch-job-interview-wearing-hijab/" target="_blank">http://scallywagandvagabond.com/2015/06/samantha-elauf-abercrombie-fitch...</a>

28
What I don't understand is why somebody who does not adhere to the employer's dress code for a religious reason gets a bye but somebody else who does not adhere to the code, not for a religious reason, gets treated differently.  Unless the employer is just acting arbitrarily, it has a reason for the dress code.  I may not like the dress code, but then I shouldn't work there; my taste does not trump the employer's reason.  Why then is somebody's religion privileged in a way my taste is not?

29
They are not allowed by law to discriminate on either the grounds of age or gender, and they shouldn't be. Remember when airlines had to finally let "stewardesses" keep working regardless of age or marital status, and even had to switch from female-only "stewardesses" to male or female flight attendants? Or when broadcasters claimed the news would lose credibility when delivered by the higher-toned voice of a woman than a man? People's right to be treated equally for employment based on their skills legally and morally trumps employers' desire to project a particular "image."

When the only political ideology is the ideology of the oligarchs, then a negative reaction or uprising by the masses is inevitable. In the days of yore that might have been  The French revolting or World Wars. In the 21st century it is again rising what with severe disparity between the haves and the have-nots, with the haves turning everything favorable to them on the backs of the have-nots. The personal has not trumped politics. By personal if you mean a living wage to put food on the table, a roof over your head and take care of your health then I am with you. But by personal if you mean zen, yoga, physical and mental wellness ( not health ) then I would call it a luxury afforded only by the oligarchs - as David Brooks would call it a soul resumé. One has to take care of the body first, the soul only when the basics of life are met.

31
While I wish Ms Jenner all the good luck in the world for the journey she has embarked upon, I wish she would do so in quiet anonymity. We have evolved into a society where some feel the need to trumpet their life choices no matter how bizarre or inane. I'm betting there's a new reality show here somewhere...

32
What does this say about "stand your ground" gun laws.  Those state laws are underpinned by the notion that when a reasonable person can interpret another's intentions as threats, it is OK to shoot to kill first as the real, actual intent is irrelevant.  Interpreting what intent truly lies in the hearts of men is trumped by free speech whereas that true intent is ignored in defence of the right to use a gun to kill someone.  US law and Constitutional rights are a mystery.  

33
 Free speech is an important American value. It used to be that people believed that free speech allowed truth to win in the marketplace of ideas. Something has changed.<br/>Money became speech and corporations people in Citizens United and the resulting deluge may drown democracy.<br/>Today, there are reports of a new Supreme Court decision that a man who made terrible threats on the Internet could not be convicted unless the prosecution could show that he actually meant harm.<br/>In the Hobby Lobby case, which was not actually bout speech so much s religion, the Court said that deeply held beliefs were so important that they could trump someone's exercise of choice in using a benefit of employment, even if the belief was not scientifically correct.<br/>The recent provocations regarding Muslim beliefs and practices in the name of Free Speech demonstrate disregard for the probable consequences of such speech. Throw in some guns and it becomes even more likely that there will be violence.<br/>College students aren't the only ones who are confused. The trajectory we are on is not likely to lead to wisdom.<br/>. 

34
Increased dunking would lead to more A.C.L. injuries. Already the bane of girls sports<br/>The pros may be better conditioned to avoid theses injuries, but you can't trump biology.<br/>WNBA is a different game. Orthopedic surgeons are busy a enough. 

35
Like the trumpeting of the "death of history" we have the proclamation of the death of politics now...dead at the texting hands of everyone's electronic toys from China.  Western people have turned their backs on everything outside and made gods of themselves in an unstoppable cult of narcissism taken to hitherto-unheard of extremes:  changing genders like Jenner-Caitlin is but the latest manifestation of this narcissism, in which cult nothing that may indulge the individual is verboten or too extreme.

36
Thank you for picking out the essential: the blithe acceptance that Alzheimer's is a fate, not a disease. There is a possible cure, a clinical application of a long acting insulin via nasal passages, that attacks the destruction of neurons. A runaway process, still not understood, Alzheimer's depends on a state of insulin depletion in the brain. The SNIFF trials of long acting nasal application, with such positive results all prior trial participants were given a six month supply, whether receiving placebo or not, at the termination of the prior trials, of the nasal insulin for themselves, these trials were halted across many highly prestigious trial sites.<br/>Why? The maker of the instrument for the application, is holding up the trials. If this were Act Up, there would be screams of protest and sit ins. But this is Alzheimer's Disease, and older people, and those holding a terrible genetic legacy for early onset disease, sit on their hands. What is the passivity caused by? Prejudices against the old, perhaps? Acceptance that the profit of medical drug and delivery mechanisms trumps the anguish of the dying and the medical care and expense of millions of sufferers?

37
Just because man's laws (privacy and equal amendment) and our culture allow this type of behavior to occur, it does not mean it is the "truth."  Man's laws and different cultures around the world will never trump God's truths.   I am praying for Bruce Jenner as the spirit of confusion and greed, and maybe a host of others have taken hold of this supposedly deeply religious man - Ephesians 6:10-18.  I don't know what religion he is following, but it is not Christianity, because he would know that God does not make mistakes - if he opened his Bible.

38
I do not know how asylum claims work in Europe.  But, here in the USA an asylum claim is a ticket to free entry.  Asylum seekers simply disappear into the vast pool of illegal immigrants after being given a hearing date years in advance.  <br/><br/>On its face the Declaration is deeply flawed in that it presumes to trump any notion of national sovereignty.  No nation is sovereign if it cannot control its borders to prevent unrestrained entry of foreigners.<br/><br/>I do not recognized the right of a refugee to barge into my home demanding protection, food, and shelter.  I do not think the USA should recognize this right either.

39
Worthless. You told us nothing of why students did not graduate. You only indicate that economic class trumps all in success.<br/>What about race?  What about IQ scores? <br/><br/>What about the fact that low income, low information families don't break out of the cycle?  Are these students woefully unprepared for college and that's why they fail?  Are low income students given spots in colleges that go beyond their aptitudes? We already know this is true.  Low income students are given , especially minorities, places in schools in which they are poorly matched. They are helped for the first year or so but they quickly see they are way out of their league in academic and social networks. Some find it like landing on Mars. They drop out.  As the study says, "Class trumps ability when it comes to college graduation".  <br/><br/>We need to stop funneling all students into college. Bring back tech colleges, trade schools, secretarial- sorry I mean Administrative Assistant schools. You want to improve life outcomes for everyone? Then stop sending them off life sheep to places they can't compete. Rich or poor, not everybody can thrive in academic environments. Wake up and stop wasting all this time and money. 

40
You obviously do not know how to read an article. The title of the article did not claim to explain why. The bulk of the article does look at test scores and thus there is absolutely no issue of low income kids being given college admission without merit. And it is not class that trumps ability as in "being classy" as the saying goes but class as in "wealth", "caste" as the article indicates.<br/>I agree to not funnel all onto college but what are the chance the CEO dad will send his kid to trade school? The kid will get tutoring all through high school and college if need be but the same percentage of them will graduate and will get help to get a good job if need be. This is the american way.  I say make college hard AND FREE FOR ALL.

41
Not that he didn't already have problems, but Dennis Hastert's life is being ruined because he is being proscecuted for LYING about withdrawing his own money from the bank (a legal act) to pay a blackmailer. As far as I can find, he is not being prosecuted for any underlying possible crime--like child abuse--he is being prosecuted for LYING about a legal act. Meanwhile, the prosecution is trumpeting unproven allegations for front-page consumption accusing him of a supposed sexual crime which happened decades ago.  How is this legal, much less ethical?  I think it is prosecutorial misconduct to charge people for LYING about something THAT IS NOT A CRIME when they don't have enough evidence to try people for a real crime. Think of how many people who have been hung out to dry for these LYING convictions.<br/><br/>If you threaten people with complete financial ruin, long prison sentences, destruction of their family and reputation, they will agree to anything.  That doesn't make it justice. Then the prosecutor gets the next big cushy promotion.

42
The desire for convictions, often for electoral brownie points, trumps truth. The case of Michael Morton where John Bradley blocked exculpatory evidence for years is the tip of the iceberg. Vengeance has no place in our criminal justice system, even though Americans are obsessed with revenge against those parts of society they do not like or approve of. Texas has a violent and dysfunctional prosecutorial culture.

43
This is just the tip of the iceberg. Your worst case nightmare involves trumped up charges of child abuse. This is magnified by local prosecutors who have their 100% conviction rates on the line. You are guilty until proven innocent. Any past or present legal or health record can be obtained - often another violation of your rights. All information is captured by poorly trained staff who have been taught to ignore objectivity as they capture evidence supporting conviction. When you do get a break, the judge's order can be ignored. And when you are finally turned loose, the newspapers are fed lies by the prosecutors. This has been witnessed in three states with different families. Only one county long ago had a decent system of social worker and detective going out for immediate investigation - the best solution to gain the information needed and get the resources needed and damage families the least.

44
I applaud David Brooks for this, and -- a rarity for me -- also most commenters, who seem as disgusted as I am by the suppression of free thought on campus.  But this isn't just a problem for academia; it's societal.  I'm disgusted by the notion that speech can be suppressed, even punished, because it might "offend" someone.  Speech which offends, or is unpopular or contrary to current standards of decency, is exactly what the 5th Amendment protects.<br/>The problem is exacerbated by thinness of skin -- people who run around constantly proclaiming how "offended" they are by something or other, as if that trumps all other considerations. Even worse, much of this being "offended" strikes me as a sham, more a fashion statement than a reflection of a deeply-felt hurt:  "All my friends say they're offended by [whatever], so I'll feel like I belong if I'm offended by it too."  The herd instinct at work.<br/>Most universities, loftily proclaiming their belief in academic rigor, are utter cowards in their support of free speech.  Their preoccupation with sensitivity, diversity (of everything but opinions) and right-thinking generally is a total rejection of the notion that a university is supposed to be a marketplace of ideas where students and instructors are exposed to challenges to their set beliefs.  It's time for colleges to grow some, err, courage and declare and enforce as official policy that the only thing they won't tolerate when it comes to speech is intolerance itself.

45
Rand Paul doesn't get it.  He needs a wake up call and this just might be his Waterloo.  I'll take my chances on the government listening in.  I'd rather they err on the side of caution.  In this case the safety of American citizens trumps personal privacy.  Besides, there is no privacy in today's world.   Every time I do a search on Google, I know my privacy has been usurped by a corporation  Senator Paul seems more preoccupied with garnering votes by his actions, than really caring our privacy.  Either he's clueless or just doesn't care. Perhaps he needs a step ladder to see the real world

46
I'm compelled to agree with an earlier comment along the lines that universities may be unduly invaded by popular culture, a culture in which truth commonly suffers (see political speeches), ideology trumps rational discourse (you pick the subject; climate change?), and we are constantly encouraged to be "outraged" (e.g. Fox).<br/><br/>On the optimistic side, however, I do think we are better off than, say, during the Red Scare.  It took time to get over that episode.

47
Being one of those mathy types, and someone who hires a lot of people with STEM skills, and other skills, I agree with the general tenor of the article, but think it goes a bit over the top when it says that "class trumps ability when it comes to graduation." Frankly, the impact of class is huge for those testing poorly, in high school.  For these folks, class appears to be 3 or 4 times more important than math ability/achievement/score (acknowledging that test scores and raw ability/talent are not always aligned) when it comes to graduating from college. <br/><br/>But for those testing in the highest group, the impact of class is somewhere between 0.75 and 1.0 times as important as math ability/achievement/etc. So, not all that surprisingly, the impact of class is much greater on those who haven't managed by sophomore year of high school to overcome (at least academically) their many disadvantages. On the other hand, the reported figures do show a fair amount of upward mobility, albeit with lots of friction and a pretty high dose of unfairness. Still, our society can (and needs to) do a lot better. Some examples of ways to reduce the unfairness, such as the small college model, are addressed in comments by other readers. 

48
Perhaps the newly Ms Jenner would consider using the financial resources at her disposal to promote transgender health and well-being rather than herself and her business interests. <br/><br/>Coming out as transgender in such a public way may be glamorous for the corporations  who sponsor her, but for significantly most transgender people, it is just another day. Issues of healthcare, safety and employment trump this huge publicity splash. <br/><br/>I don't question Jenner's motives except that the presentation points to personal glorification and income not to using those resources to help transgender people and truly engage to wider world about those around them.

Who are you to determine that these homes aren't historic? Is it because they were built for the working class? According to federal criteria, they meet the 50-year mark. Despite the existence of similar houses in the area, what makes this particular neighborhood unique -- or did, arguably -- is the fact that so many are concentrated in one area. That is what defines Queensboro Hill's character. That character and cohesiveness has been jarringly diminished by the presence of houses that in neither size nor style fit in with the surrounding environment. It is unfortunate and baffling to me to hear people support the idea that private property rights should trump above every other consideration.

An entertaining roll of hopefuls and some hot dog possibilities in the coming elections.  In speaking to a friend last evening, much to my relief, she gave me her latest glowing health report, adding that she was 89.  You're kidding, I said foolishly but it is not in her nature to play jokes.<br/><br/>We did not discuss politics or religion on this occasion, or the war raging in Iraq, her country of birth, or mention the names of a few instigators of the above, which never fails to raise our voices in unison.  Instead we spoke of her baking skills, while I extended an invitation for her to visit a small place in the country where the two of us are going to see 'Real America'.<br/><br/>We are going to vote Republican.  Our idea of Democracy is one of Equality where the Majority will work under restraint, overseen by a few power rulers.  Mr. Walker can go to straight to the White House, having been finely tuned for the position.  It is reminiscent of a party where my silent companion to the right was delving into his steak, and when asked a question he was most affable in discussing his pet hens, while one could hear the metal wires grinding away.  'My Dinner with a Robot'.<br/><br/>The name of Lindsey Graham is easy to remember, while eating animal crackers, and Mr. Pataki was once known as 'The Invisible Governor'.  A sentence I use now for my Irish Super, not on this roster of runners.<br/><br/>No mind of our own, trumped, we will vote as decreed by the Majority opinion, and be pleased as mushy pie.   

51
Could one come up with any more of a piece to point out the blatant cynicism the GOP clown car candidates abuse the public with. Run, get known, get rich. And I thought Madonna and her ilk were bad. These guys trump all of them.

The conference fell apart largely in rational recognition that its existence was a waste of time, as every country with the means to develop or acquire nuclear weapons appears to be exerting all efforts to do so, quite regardless of any innocent prior agreements not to.<br/><br/>It could be the most realistic thing a U.N. body ever did.<br/><br/>When the world's lunchroom monitor goes AWOL, the foodfights abound, and there's nothing like a nuke to trump someone else's flung potato salad. But it might not end badly, since if everyone's got a hardened warehouse of nukes, it becomes a dicey thing to be the first to lob one. We and the U.S.S.R. learned that decades ago, and it gave the U.S. time to put a man on the Moon while it gave the Soviets time to fail and fall apart. What it will do for Egypt and Saudi Arabia is a matter for the merest idle speculation.<br/><br/>Disarmament is so YESTERDAY. The last time it was seriously tried ended at Munich, and we all know how THAT bright idea turned out. Israel remembers this vividly.<br/><br/>But there always will be those who spit into the wind.

The claim that foreign workers are needed because Americans don't have the requisite skills for tech job is pure baloney.  The jobs described in the article are ones that reasonably skilled programmers can manage.<br/><br/>What this really is is the outsourcing of more and more midlevel positions in corporations, in most cases to foreign workers who will earn substantially less for the same work.  It is the inevitable solution in any economic system in which cost containment trumps all other business considerations. Increasingly, American midlevel managers are entirely disposable.

One interesting question overlooked here is how iTunes and Amazon succeeded at all. How is buying individual tracks better than buying CDs? That model economically incentivizes listening only to music you already know you like.  <br/><br/>Pandora is better, but you can't control what you play - the only win is low, low pricing. <br/><br/>Giving the customer full control with unfettered access to a catalog of millions of songs, as Spotify does, is much better. But why Spotify? Why now? Rhapsody did that for years before Spotify existed, and all streaming services, as far as I know, suggest new music. The only thing noteworthy about Spotify is that, like a few other providers, it sounds noticeably better at 320kb/s compared to Rhapsody's 192. So really, what makes Spotify stand out?<br/><br/>Which brings us to Tidal being "much mocked." Really? Because Tidal actually is different despite their embarrassingly juvenile marketing. With lossless compression at four times the data rate, it literally sounds as good as a CD. Why, in 2015, wouldn't we demand our music to sound as good as a format introduced in 1982? Seriously, why? <br/><br/>So the real story, the one I'd like to see, is an exploration of the oft stated idea that convenience trumps quality. The MP3 has apparently reduced our expectations for musical fidelity, just as the cell phone has weaned us from the idea that telephones should be as reliable as night following day, and supermarket bread has replaced our delight in the real thing. What's next?

I had intended to lead a group visit of Walt Disney World for vacation, but in the light of these developments we've discussed it and have abandoned those plans, in favor of better choices.<br/><br/>The Walt Disney company has publicly trumpeted on numerous occasions how they foster a culture of employee care and success which leads to outstanding service for the guests of the park. <br/><br/>This article makes clear that in reality they are willing to use unethical manipulations of the law to jettison their veteran employees in order to save money on cut-rate rookies who may or may not be able to do a good job.

56
@kim. Probably they do. Sadly, they paid fines because they are playing with other people's money. Mind you, the wool comes from the sheep. Their customers, shareholders and employees are the ones paying. So thinking "Big Bank" some independent entity able to come up with billions is wishful thinking. On the other hand, cutting branches (usually in areas that require them most,) cutting staff and increasing workload on existing staff, and booting non-performing customers become the their mantra. <br/><br/>And really, maybe the author has a heart of gold, but she is deriving her living on the opposite side, so she is not really an objective broker. <br/><br/>Regardless of motive though, it is about doing the most good for most people, especially those who really deserve it. From that perspective, reasons and pragmatism trump emotion and extremism

57
In Germany, Uber has run into the courts repeatedly. Their answer was basically to disregard the law and the verdict and continue on their path. This is not the behavior of a charming start up but that of a bullying multinational company which is above local law.<br/><br/>In Germany, cabs are constantly checked to make sure that the cars are safe, and similar safeguards are in place regarding the drivers. All of these things cost money, and Uber is trying to play the market without abiding by its rules. The only difference to the mafia is that the mafia knows that it is breaking the law and not trumpeting it out loud.

58
Ugh.  Are we really supposed to accept this as "heroism"?  A rich white man indulges his sexual fantasies by paying surgeons to make him into a "woman" and we trumpet that as a brave act?

59
I'm closing in on 2 million "butt in seat" miles, mostly on United, and at this point I've seen it all. I enjoy having Million Miler status on the airline, even though the perks have deteriorated over the years. I do wish the airlines would work harder for my business - clean planes and excellent customer service trumps early boarding and all the other stuff for me. I do enjoy observing the sorry chaps (yes, mostly male) who seem to think elite status on an airline confers grandness on their person. They promenade importantly to early boarding (thank you United for eliminating the stupid red carpet) and pout when their first choice of meal is unavailable. The airlines created these monsters and now have to find ways of raising the bar - most of which are tremendously unappealing to long-time, dare I say, loyal, customers?

60
I worked for Disney, and it's so sad that you would even think of doing business this way. There are unions but I guess this visa trumps all. HCL Technology was a client of mine at another place, and works closely with USAA, they were always interviewing them for tech jobs. Now it all makes sense, BTW they get paid anywhere from 10-30% less than what their American counter parts do.

61
Dear Ms. Tufekci,<br/>Apparently I missed the part about "Facebook" being mandatory for everyone. Silly me.<br/>It is really quite simple: don't go on "Facebook", don't "Tweet" and don't share "embarrassing" photos and information on the Internet. For it always seems, time and again, this "information" is not secure.<br/>But in this ego absorbed world of "Selfies", "likes" on Facebook, quests for that 15 minutes of fame, "social media" is the only venue left for the talentless to display their, well, "lack of talent" (Really, "trending now" doesn't mean what it says; if you do something stupid and post it on an Internet site the only "trend' seems to be trumpeting one's ignorance).<br/>I may be somewhat "Ludditey" appearing but the evolution of vapid television seems the equally vapid Internet with the lowest common denominator having yet to be found, shudder.<br/>As for me, if you want to get in touch, give me a call on my, get this, LAND LINE and I will gladly talk to you. I'm in the phonebook and I do screen calls with caller I.D. So far, nobody has advertised on my phone, yet.

Roger obviously knows nothing about Ukraine.'the once-pliant Ukraine of Putin’s ousted puppet, former President Viktor Yanukovych.' Viktor was not Putin's puppet, as Putin knows. Yanuk's political base was the Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. But Yanuk governed in the interests of a clan of oligarchs. Just before ,the democratically elected, Yanuk was overthrown in a coup, he blackmailed Putin $16 billion or else (Russian navy out of Crimea). Yanuk and friends would divide the spoils. And when it was gone they would demand more. What saved Putin from this public humiliation@? It  was the US State Departments pro coup policy. Putin's trump card is the stupidity and ignorance of US officials.

63
There are no arms the US or indeed NATO could ship to the Ukraine that the Russians could not easily match then trump.  Ukrainian forces have not shown an aptitude for advanced weaponry and tactics.  They in fact are challenged by just trying to control their high rates of desertion and resistance to conscription.<br/><br/>If there is ever going to be a solution to Ukraine's problems it will have to a political settlement that is full of distasteful compromises.  The Germans the key nation here not the USA have key economic interests with Russia that they are unwilling terminate to please American Cold Warriors.  <br/><br/>Merkel has a political constituency while agreeing to some form of sanctions is not going to allow the US to elbow her into overt hostile action against the Russians that re-energizes the Cold War in Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>Europe has justly grown cautious about US promoted and led military adventures in the past fifteen years that invariably are escalated as goals are not realized and end up as debacles.  One can hardly blame them for not rushing to the colors.    

64
Money trumps everything. Always. If you don't like foreigners taking American jobs, stop shopping at Walmart, where much of the merchandise is imported from India, Mexico, etc. You won't. Neither will the executives of these companies. As they lay off Americans, the savings are passed straight to them in the form of bonuses. That's how this works.

65
As I'm already tired of Presidential Politics, I'm going to comment on American Sniper. <br/><br/>It wasn't a very good picture. It droned on and on with one tedious sniper scene after another. We discovered his wife wasn't so bright producing child after child with a man she harped on to come home.  We didn't learn anything about why Chris Kyle did what he did, because if one can believe the film, he didn't know. Other than a trumped up and really embarrassing scene with his father over the dinner table that emulated Eastwood's speaking to an empty chair at least in "yikes" factor there were no clues. <br/><br/>What really worked for American Sniper was the trailer shown in theaters. I can tell you I went to see it based upon that trailer. I would have never gone otherwise. And I would have been correct. 

66
Great column, Gail.  Like many here, I'm a boomer (first wave) and of course, older, want to praise the value of experience and wisdom.<br/><br/>Does Hillary have that? Debatable.  At times her political longevity helps, but oftentimes, it seems she hasn't learned a thing about perceptions and appearances.<br/><br/>But let's leave the Dems behind, since the GOP crew is so far more interesting.  Or is it?  When someone like Rubio trumpets the fresh air of youth, only to open his mouth to spout the oldest of old ideas, there is a huge disconnect.  This is a man whose agenda has been adjusted to fit the needs of the donor class (whose agenda is truly old) and his fixation on the Cuba of the 50s and 60s, puts him squarely in the Stone Age.<br/><br/>Scott Walker offers youth too, but a more brazen kind, since he's been able to wield his ax in Wisconsin, gutting education funding, destroying unions, railing against abortion, and restricting voting.  While such moves don't sound "wise" or informed, their impetuosity mark them squarely as the rebellion of youth.  But is this what we want for the entire country?  The imposition of a severely Christian view of how Americans are to live their lives?<br/><br/>Space precludes an analysis of whose old or young among the other candidates, but I will end with this: A young fool and an old fool are still fools.  A leopard can't change its spots, and neither can these candidates.

67
"I don't see why this business model could not also be implemented at the very senior corporate executive levels within companies like Disney."<br/><br/>What makes you think it isn't?<br/><br/>Mr. Iger is responsible for the acquisition of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm.  Those moves created massive value for Disney.  If the Disney board felt someone from India or the Philippines or wherever could top that … if they felt another individual somewhere in the world could trump Iger’s record … he’d be out the door too.  His position is not something you can be trained to do.<br/><br/>As a nation we may want to think about stopping all immigration, and give ourselves 10 or 20 years to ‘get caught up’ with assimilating who’s here now, get Americans who want to work the opportunity to find a decent job, and see if we really want to get back on the FastTrack to being a Third World nation, which only works for the Big Government Party, i.e., Democratic Party, and the elites in the Republican Party.  (It’s so nice that they agree on this topic.)

68
This is just another example of corporate profits trumping the welfare of the American people. 

69
If asked before the ceremony to hold your applause, it is actually the school's set of values which should trump either of the other sets of values as you call out.  To dance around any racial undertones is absurd and deflects from the core issue:  respecting other's rights.  This is how a civilized society operates.

Yesterday, I passed my mother's glasses on my hallway table. They have sat there every day since I removed them from her face when she died more than two years ago. I rarely notice them, as they're in my everyday vision. Something yesterday made me see them as I walked past. I smiled when I thought of her. It was so nice to be getting to the point where happy memories trump the intense loss and missingness of a person. <br/><br/>So true, too, that grief arrives at the most unexpected times. Mine never showed up when it was "supposed" to, but always in its own time, its own way.

71
I have been an ABC fan for most of my adult life.  Good Morning America and the Nightly News broadcasts are mainstays in my viewing.  On both shows, "Made in America" is trumpeted by the network, apparently comfortable doing that while at the same time exploiting these programs.  Shame on you, ABC and Disney.  May the same thing happen to all of you and your families.  CBS, here I come.

72
I am quite willing to sacrifice some of my freedoms to prevent innocent people from being maimed and murdered. When I think about all of the reporting, the actual lack of factual data, I find it hard to believe that access to phone records, besides the fact that it has not hurt anyone, has not helped us in some sort of way either to rule out or include possibilities. I do not believe that the studies that were done had access to real information for all the obvious reasons. Why would you give away the few techniques that we probably have. This is just one more example of the fear in the current moment trumping the fear in the past moment. When we meet up with disaster once again because we have tied one hand behind our back, or as our enemies like to think that they can destroy us because of our own beliefs, people will wonder what we did here and ask, once again, to change boats in mid stream, over and over again. It is a country without resolve, based on total selfishness. We need to get better at all of this, not set ourselves back. Maybe we could find ways to use the data that we have not yet discovered that would deepen all of our security? We will never know. We are too busy putting our heads in the sand, even when we have no head.

73
The NSA crowd reminds me of gun control advocates.  They both say if you are not guilty of anything why should you care.  And they both are targeting the folks that are not guilty of anything nor commit crimes in order to catch "the bad guys."  Well the Constitution is pretty clear, the 4th amendment trumps all these "scare and spend" govt types and their think tank and govt contractor friends who enrich themselves for "homeland security."  Collecting my phone records doesn't stop the Saudis or others supporting ISIS or whatever radical group is threatening the Middle East at the moment.  I'd start with our "friends" over there first before we presume everyone is guilty..

74
Manufacturing? Really? Globally, manufacturing involves some of the lowest labor skill and least value added of any non-agricultural sector of the economy this side of tourism. In the U.S., manufacturing jobs pay wages near the national average for all employment, and it's only that high because manufacturing includes a few elite industries:  aerospace, telecom, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Does anyone really want Americans to work in textile factories again and compete with Bangladeshi workers -- heck, even China got priced out of that industry. Finally, how precisely would government spending possibly have any impact on our manufacturing? By bribing assembly plants to move here the way S. Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama did with Japanese and German auto makers at over $1 million per job!? That's outright blackmail that most other nations prohibit but we cannot due to states rights trumping interstate commerce.

75
Mr. Putin very logically sees American power as an obsession, if Mr. Cohen is correct, but  when American state department officials are visiting Russia's neighbors and American military is shipping large weapons to a trumped up Ukrainian government on Russia's border, it seems quite logical that Mr. Putin would find this a strange way to manifest American neutrality.  America seems to be everywhere around the world, even intruding in the Spratly Island goings on let alone in Ukraine, Yemen, and Okinawa to name a few of our appearances far from our own shores. 

76
Unfortunately, arming the Ukrainians would be a mistake.  Anything we do, Putin could easily trump. His supply lines are short, ours are long. Logistics favor the Russians: it's in their backyard. Our national interests or security are not at stake. Putin knows this and so do we.  At best, we are stuck with muddling through with sanctions, diplomacy and making clear to Putin that Poland and the Baltic states are a very different matter.<br/>We must leave Putin's ultimate fate to his management of a declining petro state, a 3rd rate economy and his growing isolation from the modern integrated world economy. In the end, if the Soviet Union was Austin Power's Dr Evil, alas, Putin's role is to be " Mini-me". 

77
All you have to do is frame an issue as a "women's issue", and identity politics trumps common sense. Statistically speaking, it is debatable whether  flibanserin can outperform a placebo. <br/><br/>I am sure the FDA panel members, a group not usually known for their moral fiber, said to themselves, "if women want to waste their money on this junk, let them, its only a little bit bad for their health, and it might occasionally work due to the placebo effect, plus it will make big pharma and the politicians happy". <br/><br/> Of course, when it comes to herbal supplements, the FDA will come down on you like a ton of bricks.    

78
Here in Texas the legislature refuses to even ALLOW rural counties to adopt as much as basic fire codes.  Even if the local govt wants them.  That's how ideologically mired in the 19th century these Republicans are (they were Democrats back in pre-Clinton/Obama days).  The completely avoidable fertilizer plant explosion in the town of West failed to budge the lege to require any changes.  So what chance is there that this disaster in one rural county have of changing the normal course of business in the Capitol?  Not much.<br/><br/>We need stormwater management laws and regulations, and for whatever reason that subject was not addressed in this piece.  But that's communism, according to the GOP tea partiers who run the Capitol these days, so the issue won't be addressed.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the City of Austin does have a pretty good floodplain management plan--developed in response to multiple avoidable disasters enhanced by laissez-faire development policies with little regard for stormwater management.  But it took people dying to get the city's attention.  But as goes the City of Austin, so does not usually go for the legislature which meets here.<br/><br/>I think it will take many more deaths in other locations--in politics it's location location location--to get through to Texas voters that geology and hydrology trump ideology, no matter how deeply ingrained those anti-regulatory beliefs may be.

79
chris ... look at GISS, the adjustments are stunning and it is almost always the warm-outlier by a margin.  One writer dubbed this the effects of 'Hansen's magic crayon' as many changes were made to decades old data too (cool the past= a warmer present/trajectory) and, also warm the present.<br/><br/>You mention the 15 years trend ... we now have one for flat lining and one for cooling as well, depending on the data set.  <br/><br/>What we do not have in any data set in the warming either Hansen or the IPCC predicted or projected under any scenario, while we do see climate responding to natural variables such as the oceanic oscillations.  As of now - all data sets would establish a massive pause and our understanding of the PDO and AMO another couple of decades of a lack of warming (such as IPCC expert ocean modeler Eduardo Zorita called for years ago).  New work just published in Nature agrees with Zorita, decades without warming and probable cooling of 0.5C to frost the cake.<br/><br/>Now, if we remove Hansen's magic crayon and account for the cooling to come, then what will the accumulated temperature change be, in the face of carbon ppm then 'wayyyyyyy' above now or anything human's have ever added.<br/><br/>Natural variables trump carbon and any magnifiers it may entail - just as the actual climate and kit tells the story (or non-story), 2035 looks cooler than today, impossible! Nope - highly probable.   

80
Facts trump philosophical truths. Unfortunately, those that pursue only that which is their philosophical truth are disingenuous tools as those that opposed Lister. Draconian philosophers will never apologize for their lies.

81
When someone notes that they are an activist before being a parent, especially when writing about something to do with their child, they go to the bottom of the class.  Your political views cannot trump the gift of life you were given.  I am a parent of a 37 year old woman who is on the autism spectrum.  There was no diagnosis of this for years--no resources- just lots of questions--that are finally being addressed as more information surfaces.  So whether or not you like Autism Speaks-- whether they fit your "views"-- they may just be providing a kernel of information to someone like me who has been wondering for years just what the heck is going on with my daughter.  Mr. Perry might want to think outside his short vision and prejudices that he is passing on to his daughter.  He is coloring her world without her permission.  A child's compassion is priceless

82
The implied argument in Heather MacDonald's post is a false one.  Either police can prevent crime and enforce the law without violating the constitution or they can not.  To decline to do their job because they fear they can't do it without violating the constitution and so don't do it, is telling.  It says our entire police forces are admitting they don't know how to be professionals within the law.<br/><br/>They swear to uphold the constitution like all govt officials and there is a reason for this.  The constitution trumps all - nobody is above it.  To chose between that and crime is an unfair choice and we have no need to.  It is and should be possible to have the state enter our daily lives in a way that does not violate our basic rights.<br/><br/>If that is too much to ask, then the problems are far deeper than anything the brave protestors have drawn our attention to.

83
We are a lucky nation to have someone as brave as Snowden as a citizen. I hope that as public opinion on mass surveillance evolves, so will the opinion of Snowden's decision to come forward. The courage of Snowden, Greenwald, and Poitras over the past two years has been inspiring and enlightening. I hope to one day be cheering as Snowden freely returns to the U.S., welcoming to power a generation whose respect for basic civil liberties trumps their fear.

84
Good luck with living off the grid, my friend.  There is nothing "absurd" about expecting to live a life free from unwarranted government intrusion.  The only absurdity is people believing because you decide to use the Internet, a telephone, Facebook, email, a bank, a doctor, etc., you have given up all rights to privacy from government intrusion.<br/><br/>We have something called the constitution and I am pretty sure it trumps even what the folks at the NSA decide is necessary to protect us.

85
What was that old definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and and over and expecting different results.<br/><br/>That is what we get with the tax-cut ideology repeatedly embraced by the right-wing.  Ideology routinely trumps facts with these mentally ill radicals. This is as predictable as the sun rising. Am happy that Dr. Krugman keeps hope alive that facts will eventually prevail. Despair, however, is perhaps a more realistic sentiment, unfortunately.

86
I didn't notice one commenter mention lung cancer - currently causing the most cancer deaths and strongly linked to smoking. I started smoking as a teen and smoked for 21 years before quitting cold turkey (very empowering!) thirty years ago when I started to have stirrings of desire to become a parent.<br/>1/2015 I was diagnosed with stage 3B NSCLC Adenocarcinoma which has progressed to stage 4. I feel sad when I pass so many people smoking on NYC streets. The enormous loss of lives and health care dollars is tolerated. Corporate interests once again trump citizen's.

87
It is sad that concepts such as Liberty and Freedom and have been trumped by Fear and Suspicion. Not very surprising considering human history, but still sad. The concept of "innocent until proven guilty" is being thrown out the window to be replaced by "probably guilty, we better keep an eye on you".

88
Safe in the embrace of an authoritarian regime that it is necessary for him to please in order to escape the consequences of his actions, Edward Snowden preaches to the world and polishes his combination of with-it youthfulness  and Christ-like probity. His public relations agents, laughingly called "journalists" even though they make no attempt to be impartial, trumpet his cause and burnish his image.<br/><br/>The goal of this impressive display of the power of celebrity is to draw attention away from these unpleasant realities: 1. Edward Snowden stole data which he was obligated to protect. 2. Edward Snowden uses the data for his own purposes and ends. 3. Edward Snowden is accountable to no one -- unlike elected officials, for example -- except Vladimir Putin. 4. We have to take his word for it when he tells us he is acting in our own best interests. <br/><br/>Snowden has accomplished many of his goals and clearly enjoys being lawgiver to the world. But the world is still a dangerous place that will not suddenly be washed of sinfulness through the unmasking of necessary secrecy. As a country,  America needed to have a discussion about the issue of privacy vs. security.  But what happens when Snowden's recklessness harms people, and to whom will the world turn for justice?

89
UW Madison is one of the best universities in the country, if not the world. Among other markers that I value highly such as the quality and quantity of research and creative products that emerge and the high caliber of education the students receive, are things that Walker should understand -- the Wisconsin state universities generate 12.4 billion dollars for the state's economy. As a professor at a competing Big 12 university, I am confident that Dr. Moynihan is correct -- faculty will leave UW schools in droves (this is already beginning to happen) as other universities see the opportunity to recruit top scholars and their funding and other forms of productivity will go with them. I am astonished to see Walker's ideology trumping common sense when it will inevitably involve revenue loss to the state.

90
 Easy for you to say this from the comfort of your armchair there, but since "facing the music" conceivably could include being executed on trumped-up treason charges, I think Snowden's options are limited. I rather suspect he would be happier in most countries other than Russia but if you think back to the timeline of the events a couple years ago you can see that he didn't really have a lot of choice.

91
It's always edifying to read the dubious certainties of Brooks' pronouncements on Iraq and what we ought to be doing in a land he helped destroy as one of the chief cheerleaders of our hardline positions and trumped up nonsense that got us to invade in the first place.  For which I have yet to hear him atone, except indirectly in his avalanche of soft lens quasi or pseudo social science, cultural anthropology and ethics lite for the masses. 

92
This administration is incompetent? How many Republicans have been willing to confront reality when it comes to the Chinese? We opted for free trade instead of fair trade with a country that does not have an honest, transparent market economy; does not respect intellectual property rights; and has been conducting state-sponsored espionage against American commercial interests for years. This is what you get when big business buys politicians. Corporate interests have trumped national-security interests and the public good in exchange for cheap products and high profits.

93
His lawyers are negotiating for a reasonable deal for his return to the US. <br/><br/>Only a fool would come back and let the surveillance state dominated federal government toss you into federal prison indefinitely, or face the capital punishment on some trumped up charge. 

94
This is a cruel and abusive sport on so many levels - the flip side of the money and the glitz being  injury, drugging, whipping, bad breeding, slaughterhouses - to name but a few.<br/>When will the NY Times and sports journalists stop trumpeting this sport?<br/>I guess when the money stops.<br/>It is a travesty.

95
Douthat distorts the liberal view of physician aid in dying when he says, "autonomy trumps any possible rule against self-harm." For many people, living and dying in agony is a worse form of self-harm than a chosen, painless death. Progressives and moderates want the option of ending their own suffering, while conservatives seem to aggressively advocate suffering. Of course, they're more gung-ho in favor of it for others than for themselves. Mother Theresa was an example. She touted suffering for the abjectly poor people she was able to influence, but hied herself to the best-equipped hospital for palliative treatment of the symptoms of her own terminal illness.

96
But Ross,  you are seeing morality only in sexual and parental context.   You ignore economic context.   But the Bible specifically says:  "Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out the grain."   And "The laborer is worthy of his hire."<br/>these passages mean that WORKERS MUST BE PAID A LIVING WAGE.<br/>In fact the loss of belief in God and in Heaven and Hell  simply means that the poor lose hope and the rich lose fear.  The rich are free to exploit the poor and force them into slavery and starvation without fear of retribution from God.  And the poor no longer believe that God will help them, or reward them for their sufferings with heavenly bliss.<br/>Your faith is strangely skewed as if sexual sin was the only sin that mattered while ignoring the conservative policies of supporting what God would consider economic sin.<br/>You also ignore the sin of dishonesty:  even though the Ten Commandments absolutely prohibit lying:   "Thou shalt not bear false witness",   and even though Satan is called the father of lies,  you insist that conservative dogma about sexual sin trumps the lies of Fox News and the lies of Republican politicians.<br/>You are a fake:  you can't really believe in God and still see sexual sin as  more important than lying and cheating the poor of their labor.  

97
.<br/>    Thank you for saying what has long needed to be said.<br/><br/>    It was both insightful and Jonathan Swiftian in its careful refutation of the fear industry.<br/><br/>    Speaking of the fear industry - its biggest enabler seems to be the broadcast media who seem to be highly invested in broadcasting the scariest, exaggerated and sometimes fictional thing they can find. Decades ago we were all right with a modicum of control of the worst impulses of the media but now freedom of speech trumps everything - it may not be the best long term approach.<br/>.

98
California has a well earned reputation for regulating many small and large activities.  Sometimes, the state over-regulates, but with the respect to groundwater, California has been a Libertarian nirvana.  We have no effective groundwater drilling &amp; pumping regulations unlike neighboring conservative states like Arizona.  The result is this unholy mess where property rights trump any rational allocation of water supplies.  I don't think we can wait another 5 years for the state to get the groundwater drilling regs in place.  

99
BRING BACK "STOP AND FRISK" . . .<br/><br/>...as it will save many lives -- especially those which are the result of black on black killings.<br/><br/>And, less killings via guns sure trumps Mayor Bill de Blasio's Liberal PC ideology.

Perhaps Google should just skip automobiles entirely, and focus on teletransport or, better yet, virtual travel.  By the way, what fuel powers these driverless autos?  If fossil based, none of this will much matter, will it?<br/><br/>As an aside, for me at least, there goes one more of life's little pleasures - driving a well designed and well made car on the open road.  I suppose most would prefer to be texting.  Passive, it seems, trumps active yet again.  Oh, well, as the saying goes, "To err is human".  Quite.

The Editorial Board seems confused.  Crime is down, it trumpets, but stop the strategies that were in effect when this reduction took place.  It must have been something else that led to that reduction.  <br/><br/>Cops should not respond to their mayor's, attorney general's and president's not standing behind them when situations get dangerous. They should stop harassing criminals, and, one more thing, open the jails.  <br/><br/>And what's all this about people criticizing the mayor??  Yes, someone certainly needs to get a grip.

Texas is all mythology. They and Alaska are the two most urbanized states, but they pretend to be cowboys. A one-crop economy -- oil and refining -- has meant feast or famine instability as gas prices wildly fluctuate globally, yet Texas believes it's their low taxes and "business friendly" small government approach is the reason for their growth. Blacks and Latinos are treated miserably and disenfranchised by gerrymandering and voter restrictions, yet they spend all their time trumpeting their freedom and liberty.

103
When we think we (individually) are the center of the universe, then of course everything becomes all about protecting me and mine.  Our irrational fear is simply the consequence of our cultural belief that individuals are more important than the collective.  If we valued the collective more, we would not worry so much if 100, 1000, or even 10,000 of us die.  The other 300,000,000 others of us would soldier on.  Alas, each of us is more important than America as a whole, so of course our individual fear, and the demands that stem from that fear, trump all.

104
It's all about me.  I better get mine while I still can.  This common theme has ruined civilizations in the past and will continue to do so.  Common sense and positive shared outcomes do not prevail during desperate times.  California should have been prepared for this mishap years ago.  The sad part about the whole story is that even now, with the writing on the wall, things are too slow to change.  We are in store for many more stories like this as climate changes, people are displaced and unrest trumps all of the laws we hold dear. 

105
So why not read Harlan Ellison's "Memo from Purgatory"?<br/><br/>And, oh please, academics who fudge the facts? I don't want to hear<br/>lame excuses from Ethnographers that feelings trump truth.<br/><br/> "But some sociologists counter that ethnography is concerned not just with facts but with people’s perceptions of those facts, which powerfully shape their behavior and experience."

106
Like most people, I stand in awe of the military exploits of these elite warriors. But for all of their heroic (and perhaps at times, barbaric) missions, had the bloodshed that was unleashed, work in favor of tilting the geopolitical equation towards America?<br/><br/>The special forces in Vietnam did not halt Ho Chi Minh's political goal of a unified Vietnam.<br/><br/>The special forces in Afghanistan can not contain Mohammed Omar's vision of a Taliban fundamentalist state.<br/><br/>And it appears that the combined forces of the US and several other middle eastern countries can not halt the steady gains of a fervent ISIS.<br/><br/>The real equation is simple: 300 of the world's most fierce killing machines cannot contain the political and religious conviction of entire regions. Ideas--no matter how repellent or enlightened--will always trump over the seemly mighty SEAL Team 6.

"The real equation is simple: 300 of the world's most fierce killing machines cannot contain the political and religious conviction of entire regions. Ideas--no matter how repellent or enlightened--will always trump over the seemly mighty SEAL Team 6."<br/><br/>Do you think the special forces could have won WW2? The seals are not expected to wipe out the political and religious convictions of entire regions. Its one tool in the arsenal. Ideas do not always trump. Did Nazism trump the combined forces of the allies?  Well no. It got smashed.

There isn't much to being 85 that can't be handled.  I get up in the morning and feed the cat and take whatever medication I'm on and then make coffee.  I'm retired but living alone there's a lot to do day to day to keep myself clean, fed, and interested in the world.  I can make an entire morning out of The Times online, but I don't usually do that.  There's e-mail to read and write, banking to check on, and the news on TV.  I sometimes  wish I had someone to be with, but then i'm an only child and I enjoy my alone status so I don't pursue it.  I love not being told to do by anyone or even having to listen to suggestions about how I live my life.  I play the trumpet so I practice every day and sometimes play jazz at jam sessions with friends.  I have nearby grandchildren and they are nice to behold but I have never based my life on grandchildren.  I  can barely stand to sit through their little league games and I make it a rule to never go and hear them play in dreadfully out of tune fifth grade orchestras.  I love movies, used to write them, so I usalluy watch a movie every night.  And then there are the Yankees.  I'm reasonably healthy but I do have to drag a compact oxygen concentrator around with me if I go t the market or get on an airplane.  It's a kind of racket.  People never let me lift a suitcase and are always volunteering to put away my supermarket cart less that strain what they perceive as my failing resources.  All in all I consider myself a very lucky man.

".....a convoluted braid of public service and personal aggrandizement, a queasy-making brew of altruism and vanity, a mechanism for employing loyalists and rewarding friends, a bazaar for favor trading."<br/><br/>In other words, business as usual for Washington, for presidential candidates on the other side and, in particular, the relatively uncriticized Bush family (or should I say Family).  You don't need a foundation to practice sleaze.<br/><br/>I would rather see Bernie Sanders as the Democratic candidate, but if it's Hillary she will get my vote in sheer and enthusiastic self-defense against what any Republican would do to the nation, and especially to the supreme court.  Given the record of the GOP in recent years, in the 2016 election of all elections, party and ideology should trump personality.

111
If a man says he is a woman, because he feels like a woman, it raises an obvious question. What does feeling like a woman mean? Does it mean liking pretty dresses and romantic comedies? Does feeling like a man mean liking sports and beer? There is no way to answer the question without resorting to sexist stereotypes. <br/><br/>There's another troubling issue here too. If a man declares himself to be a woman, we are supposed to accept that self-description at face value, and respect this person's "gender identity". This person may indeed experience himself as a woman, but what about my experience? My eyes may tell me this person is a man, and my ears may tell me he speaks with a man's voice. <br/><br/>Why should this person's version of reality (I'm a woman), trump my version of reality (he's a man)?

112
When a man loves the woman in himself... all well and good. I like it. All of us are part male, part female as many of us know and have known for quite a while. Nothing wrong with that. Then we have this retardataire focus on cleavage and sultry poses and mascara etc etc-- superficial clues to the fact that Jenner as a "man" felt himself washed up and largely ignored as a middle-aged, pasty-faced man. Fast forward to THIS MOMENT with lurid trumpets blaring: The Jenner Spectacle in all it's exploitative splendor-- as meaningful as a wad of cotton candy made up of totally artificial ingredients. Dear Mr/Ms Jenner: Welcome to the tribe of Empty Ciphers.

1) Psychological treatment is less likely to be sought in regions that emphasize toughness over thoughtfulness, denial over honesty, supernatural over rational.  Lower population density also makes it easier to sustain traditional, often self-defeating, beliefs about emotional and cognitive health (and politics, for that matter).<br/>2) A major turn-off: The widespread belief that psychotherapy must necessarily be long-term, open-ended, and focused on "insight."  In contrast, modern, evidence-based therapies focus on problem-solving and results.  Insight, while fascinating, is not necessary to identify and unlearn the irrational thinking habits, developed in childhood, that cause most depression and anxiety.  The impression that psychotherapy invariably involves Freudian couches is sustained by old-school entrenchment, poor PR on the part of organized psychology (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/psychotherapys-image-problem.html?src=xps)" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/psychotherapys-image-problem.html?src=xps)" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/psychotherapys-image-problem.h...</a> and establishment media.  The NY Times's weekly Couch column, for example, while purporting to cover "any... kind of curative talk" covers only the long-term, insight-oriented, psychodynamic kind.  And it's called "Couch," for goodness sake!<br/><br/>Evidence-based therapy provides techniques to obtain results (as well as plenty of insight).  The mistaken belief that psychotherapy must be lengthy and mysterious understandably turns many people away, especially those who live in rural regions where toughness typically trumps vulnerability.

114
Corporate irresponsibility strikes yet once again. The profit motive among corporate executives seems to trump human decency -- of deliberately ignoring the negative consequences of one's actions on our fellow human beings and the natural world in general when it happens to conflict with the "bottom line"...Now this clearly is a problem that has reached epoch proportion. <br/><br/>Our increasingly polluted chemical world is beginning to sap the life out of all of us, including our planet, whether we realize it or not. How anyone can be in support of "deregulation" when you factor in the rich history of abuse when it comes to corporate irresponsibility is a depressing mystery to me.

115
Gemli<br/>It will be interesting to see your reaction when/if the emails that Hillary destroyed get disclosed by some of the receivers of those emails. There is a point at which ethics actually need to trump ideology. I hope you would agree

116
Victor Espinoza announced that he will be donating his entire winnings to City of Hope, a cancer center. Perhaps in this case sentiment trumped earning a living.

117
Bijan, <br/><br/>Why does identifying as a woman make Bruce Jenner a woman? When did we decide that desire trumped reality? When did we decide that men get to tell women what a woman is?<br/><br/>Besides, to know he feels like a woman, he would have to first know what it feels like to be a man, right? Otherwise how would he know his feelings are those of a woman and not a man?

118
The situation and the calculus for Democratic voters and candidates seem less complicated than presented here. No matter where Hillary Clinton comes out on the progressive spectrum, those who vote for her primary challengers will favor her over whoever the Republicans nominate - trumped up ethical charges notwithstanding. O'Malley seems positioning for a cabinet post [his roots in progressive Maryland wouldn't make him much of a complement as VP candidate]. Sanders is the most consistent and principled candidate in either party, and will encourage a lively debate that will prepare Ms. Clinton better for the national election. On Mr. Chafee ... I don't have a view. 

119
"Why does Bernie Sanders not qualify?"<br/><br/>Viable candidates like Bernie Sanders will continue to get short shrift in the Times because the Times has already chosen Hillary as the heir apparent. <br/><br/>For the majority, fantasy and the "will to believe" will always trump facts and inconvenient truths, as this piece in The Intercept clearly shows: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/05/40-years-democratic-presidents-talking-much-want-get-money-politics/" title="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/05/40-years-democratic-presidents-talking-much-want-get-money-politics/" target="_blank">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/05/40-years-democratic-presid...</a>

120
@PrairieFlax: You're absolutely right. But bear in mind, all the mud slinging aside, the Times has already anointed Hillary the heir apparent. <br/><br/>In the end, fantasy always trumps facts. 

121
Disney Parks webpage trumpets, "where dreams come true", forgetting to add,  unless you are a faithful employee then switch "dreams" with "nightmares". <br/><br/>Typical CEO double speak since it only applies to foreigners who will work cheap so that current employees may be unceremoniously tossed under the bus. <br/><br/>If corporations are people, Disney is most certainly not a person you would want for a neighbor. 

122
"Executives of these companies genuinely believe that over the long run, information technology — including, naturally, the services they themselves provide — is crucial to bettering society." I don't know why none of the comments addresses this vital point by the author - and how vitally wrong he is. FB &amp; Google are out to make a buck. They would rather gobble each other for profit than work with each other to be as virtuous as the author suggests. The sad thing is, it makes their trumpeted virtue true double-speak. And that's been forever what we citizens have to sort out and hold our powers to: we want truth and justice but we won't get it without higher principles in play. Do you trust any government in debt or a corporation to play by higher principles? Don't. Never do - and you're one step ahead of being fooled. 

123
Regarding competing access needs, it's really quite simple.<br/><br/>Figure out whose need is greater.  <br/><br/>Example:  Someone's need not to have a seizure trumps need for a harmless non-intrusive stim needed to focus trumps someone else's desire to not feel embarassed.<br/><br/>As for the white machine noise /driven crazy by white noise...headphones?  Close the door?  

124
As we all should have long since come to realize, in matters concerning our state security apparatus reason, due process, fairness have no standing.  Any appeal to "national security considerations", the 21st century's equivalent of the post-Civil War era's "bloody shirt", trumps all arguments.  It and its dimwitted cousin, "we must support the troops", have, almost literally, become the get-out-of-jail-free card for every half-witted demagogue from the local dogcatcher to the Oval office.

125
Khalief Browder was taken off the streets at 16 after school one day, on some trumped up charge about a stolen backpack and went on to spend three years, mostly in solitary, at Rikers without a trial. He was finally let go, no charges. He committed suicide yesterday.<br/><br/>RIP, Khalief Browder!<br/><br/>I blogged about him here a few weeks ago.<br/><a href="http://www.rimaregas.com/2015/04/kaliefbrowder-a-desaparecido-in-jimcrows-jails-blacklivesmatter-on-blog42/" title="http://www.rimaregas.com/2015/04/kaliefbrowder-a-desaparecido-in-jimcrows-jails-blacklivesmatter-on-blog42/" target="_blank">http://www.rimaregas.com/2015/04/kaliefbrowder-a-desaparecido-in-jimcrow...</a><br/><br/>The New Yorker's Jennifer Gonnerman's final piece on Browder:<br/><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015?mbid=social_facebook" title="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015?mbid=social_facebook" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015?mbid=so...</a><br/><br/>The Marshall Project, Bill Keller's new publication, put this out about the continued solitary confinement at Rikers, in spite of the law:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/02/who-runs-rikers" title="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/02/who-runs-rikers" target="_blank">https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/02/who-runs-rikers</a>

126
For a timeless parable that makes the same point, see the children's story, "Chicken Little." Doomsday prophecies travel fast and have long half-lives that trump rational thinking, especially when promulgated in the service of ideologies. The arch-right and its mouthpieces, such as Fox News, are masters at fomenting fear of the have-nots among the haves. There is nothing so persistent as an ingrained irrational believe, nor so dangerous.

127
Sensible political discourse is virtually impossible when fear is substituted for reason and facts are trumped by ideology. 

128
A grown-up? Walker can't face his critics in person. He spends no time in Wisconsin, and in fact doesn't seem to be all that much interested in it. What's strong in Wisconsin he wants to destroy. He says one thing on one side of the Iowa border, another on the other. If he has such strong convictions, why is he afraid to utter them in one context but not to trumpet them in another? He cares only about whatever will get him elected at one moment, he double-crosses people when it suits him, and he breaks laws, too, when his bankrollers need him to. Obama's presidency has been without any scandals or internal drama. You don't know Scott Walker, and you don't want to. Trust the people in Wisconsin (and I'm not in a union. I've just watched this state go down the toilet.

129
I have friends who ttrumpet the Tea Party doings non-stop. Their particular ointment fly is American Unionism.<br/>The Irony is that these friends are retired Teamsters and IBEW. Apparently, collecting pensions with both hands and retiring from union jobs that fed and clothed their families quite well thanks to collective bargaining has erased their collective memories.<br/><br/>Translated: Now that I have mine, you can't have yours. You aren't entitled to a decent wage or safe working conditions. Now that I have mine, let's dismantle the whole shebang.<br/><br/>America - The Land That Time Forgot.

130
I don't much like getting stuck with the check for the 2006 economic crash, the war in Iraq, global warming, and a few other little bells and whistles that "white culture," started, either, so maybe a little less trumpeting.

131
You haven't mentioned one of the most important facts about being black in urban America. Many young black men avoid incarceration only by living on the fringes of civil society, unable to acknowledge their real identities to officialdom for fear of being sent down on one of the many trivial and/or trumped-up charges which the police have at their disposal. For such men, marriage is impossible and regular employment, a fixed address and a settled existence as part of a family are a hopeless dream.

132
Republican greed and short sightedness generally trump the long range view of the general health and welfare of the planet for the benefit of the many. They usually wait for tragedy to strike and then they demand in a large voice that the "small" government do something large and immediate to mitigate their problem and their misery.

133
With all their trumpeting efficiencies of mergers and acquisitions for business one'd expect the GOP to push for more Federal control.  <br/><br/>This isn't the case for only one reason - cynical politics of putting the blame for job shortages on regulation and government instead of their own greedy friends in business - raping the environment and the economy; enabled by the Grande Ol' Party!  

134
When are we going to get an article that examines the effect of  Walker's  political successes. Are Wisconsin schools doing better. Are teachers able to be recruited and retained or are they demoralized. Walker did not destroyed collective bargaining rights for police and fire unions who receive the richest public pensions. Does this bother  Anyone. What other small government policies have been enacted. And how are they working. Governor Brownback showed us that ideology trumped reality in Kansas. Is this happening in Wisconsin or is all hunky dory .

135
Keynesian economics explains perfectly the 2008 crash and our continuing economic weakness -- flagging wage-based demand.<br/><br/>In the end it comes down to whether we are going to allow the drive for free-er enterprise to trump human rights and aspirations.  The 40-year drop in payroll as a percentage of GDP must be reversed if we are to save our political/economic system.

136
Walker has done more to derail Wisconsin's progressive legacy than any other public official in the state's history, including Joe McCarthy.  He appeals to those whose "fear reactive" reflex trumps any presentation of empirical data with a contrary or alternate position.  Wisconsin's university system is now poised to implode due to his self serving administration's $250,000,000 budget cut.  Don't bother trying to convert any of his minions-their value system preempts any attempt to counter their metric with facts.

137
I'd like to be courteous &amp; find common ground like agreeing that the weather is particularly balmy or that American Pharoah shouldn't be put out to pasture too soon, although if your small town is anything like mine, then it should come as no surprise that the people who have the local politician's ears over breakfast are usually the local car dealers who own Ford dealerships, bankers, defense contractors representing Raytheon or Boeing or the head of the military base, energy company presidents, commercial property realtors or mall developers (usually all Republicans.) The cosy relationship between monied political campaign contributors to both GOP &amp; Democrats electoral interests trumps the local environmentalist, Planned Parenthood director or non-profit youth directors. This imbalance in power results in feelings of resentment between the haves &amp; have nots &amp; their access to politicians both locally &amp; nationally. Thus, it is always safe to remark about the weather or your latest hiking trip, although dangerous terrain to discuss larger issues that pertain to various interest groups which could persuade politicians to take a real stand on real issues other than cosmetic diatribes about God, Our Country &amp; our Veterans while slurping down OJ &amp; eggs over easy on Sunday a.m.

138
I hate to say this. But we have a lot to learn from these murderous thugs. If the U.S. Raid discovered a trove of details about how the ISIS operates, why are we disclosing this fact? If ISIS knows what information has been compromised, do you think they are going to follow through these plans? Most certainly not! They will just switch to their Plan B or Plan C. All this transparency business has gone too far. We show our trump card before we can use it, completely neutralizing it. Pray tell me what the citizenry can do with this information? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! It's time we stopped being foolish and our own worst enemy.

139
The road to Hades is paved with good intentions.  Obama is the first American to win two elections as President with popular and electoral vote majorities since Eisenhower. <br/><br/> Eisenhower had to deal with the lingering politically transformational legacy of FDR.  Obama is facing the impact of Reagan. <br/><br/> And the world and America have changed beyond recognition.  Be careful what you wish for.  If short term partisan political interests trump long term American values in a zero sum game then America loses it's exceptional place and space.

140
My initial response to the essays by Mazur, Nair,  Barroozo, Goldstine, and Murtagh was to conclude that Chinese hackers have take over the opinion section and substituted totally absurd obsolete intellectual clap trap as a joke just to show off their prowess. <br/><br/>My next response was to start weeping like Obama at Beau Biden's funeral at how tragic and complete is the corruption of intellectual honesty and the power of reasoning among America's elites (as sampled by the Times.)  <br/><br/>I doubt very much that any higher level Republicans will dare challenge the Democrat orthodoxy on either (1) whether climate change is really manmade and/or all that serious (2) humans are intrinsically bad and self-selected international elites need to control the numbers of them allowed to exist, and (3) we need the most intrusive and irresistible big government solutions possible to 1 &amp; 2  JUST IN CASE the global warming and population alarmists are right.<br/><br/>Few in the GOP are brave enough to stick their heads very far out of their fox holes and start shooting back. Someday their courage will rise to the sticking point. When? Why?<br/><br/>Because in the end the truth will out. In the end trumped-up hysterias, self-serving technocrat agendas for promotions and grants, and elitists blathering with their Hollywood-celebrity-level understanding of science and truth, will all fall to the ground and stink like dead fish in the hot sun.

141
What is at issue here is the President's power to make Foreign Policy.  Justice Kennedy summed it up by, "The nation must speak with one voice, and that voice must be the president's". Yes, the President trumps the Congress in setting foreign policy. I believe, however, that citizens of Jerusalem should have the right to choose their citizenship of either Israel or Palestine, since it is a shared state, but certainly part of both. I don't know where the opposition is coming from. Doesn't make sense to me. (ok I'm not informed) 

142
Why does someone who moves to a foreign country, becomes a citizen in a foreign country, have any say in American foreign policy? Since Mr. Zivotofsky obviously thinks loyalty to Israel trumps loyalty to the United States, perhaps he can concentrate on the politics of his new country. It's time Israelis stop interfering in American internal affairs, and be grateful for the enormous amount of money we give them and the incalculable political cost we incur by reflexively supporting them. 

143
This process has become abusive to the citizens of Greece and unproductive.  Creditors will not be repaid by destroying the Greek economy.  Germany accepted debt reductions after WWII and currently has debt that would prohibit it from entering the EU.  <br/><br/>If "free enterprise" continues to be used as an excuse to trump the human rights, dignity and aspirations of the Greek people, they are doomed to be further radicalized.  Rule by the Golden Dawn Party with its demonization of minorities and immigrants is the last thing Europe needs.

144
Obviously the liberal media is worried about the prospect of Rubio running for President. Coming from such a liberal bastion as the NYT, one would think that they would extol the virtues of somebody who didn't come from a family with money to where he is today. Instead, they look for any chink in the armor, twist it around to make it look bad and then publish hit pieces against him. This, in addition to publishing an article showing he has had 3 traffic convictions (yes, the rest were his wifes) and trumping it up to make him look reckless just shows to what lengths the NYT will go to make him look bad. Now, I remember time and time again, teh NYT defending John Kerry's wealth saying it wasn't really his but his wife's money. However, in this case, the Times wants to lump in the financial struggles of Mr Rubio and his wife's business. Just so hypocritical and predictable.

145
Isn't McCain the guy who, as the economy was crashing, treated us to his wise council that "the fundamentals of the economy are sound" or words to that effect?  For good measure he was probably among those who absolutely knew that Romney would bury Obama.  McCain, Byron York, Fred Barnes, Tucker Carlson, and the rest of them are as predictable and dull as Clarence Thomas.  Of course the Republicans are still pushing austerity because, to them. Obama was sooo bad that the economy never recovered at all.  Personally I think they're whistling past a graveyard.  The conservative argument has been trumped cold by the attention to income inequality, but they don't know it yet.

146
Exercise trumps everything else for a good night sleep. 

147
I respectfully disagree with Ms. Brody on practically everything she has written here.  While Ms. Brody trumpets pro-Organic consumer's "fears", her faith in the credo "better living through chemistry" is beyond appalling.<br/><br/>Farmers have always bred better livestock by selecting better "parents".  That process is natural, healthy and productive.  To have a chemical, or gene transplant sprayed over a field is NOT natural, or healthy.  A plant created to resist Roundup, and then sprayed with something else, is nothing I would want to eat.  These chemicals also get into the water table, contaminating even more.<br/><br/>How many pharmacuticles from the 1950's/60's &amp; 70's have proven to be very dangerous or even deadly, even though they were praised as being a miracle when they first came out?  How many chemical fertilizers have to be used in greater and greater quantities to produce "good" results?<br/><br/>GMO's are not about "feeding the hungrey".  They are all about corporate profit, and literally controlling sources of food.  In an obscenely overcrowded World, we can't all be out in the fields bringing in the corn and potatoes - BUT - I defy you to find a better tasting, healthier corn, tomatoe, or potatoe than a 100% Organic one.<br/><br/>My guess is that Ms. Brody thinks that water comes from the tap, and she looks at the World through her apartment window, or on her laptop.  There is a REAL World of soil and plants out there, and it is better than a test tube.  Ms. Brody is urban, and uninformed.

148
Thank you, Ms. Brody.  <br/><br/>A pleasure to see science trump superstition.<br/><br/>My congratulations and admiration for taking a stand for Truth against the tide of anti-science health food fads.

149
Thanks to the NYTimes for -- finally -- making explicit the difference between the grand jury process for police officers and the grand jury process for the rest of us. It is probably too little, too late, to make an impact on all those who trumpet the failure of grand juries to indict as somehow exonerating these police officers, but at least it has finally been mentioned.

150
The key element is in your last sentence and I, regretfully, do not share your optimism. Technology produces as many problems as it solves. The much touted green revolution is producing a dead world in two ways. First, pesticides and factory farming are polluting the land and water while contributing massively to the destruction of habitat that sustains smaller - hence eventually larger - life forms. It is killing birds, bees, butterflies, and amphibians at an alarming rate. Second, through patenting of seeds, corporations are impoverishing further farmers in the third world who are commiting suicide in desperation since they can no longer save seeds for the next year's crops.  The same corporate farming methods are reducing the variety of crops, making us dangerously vulnerable to famine from the failure of a single variety of crops. <br/><br/>Yes, we have seen this before. We saw it in Ireland in the 1840-50s when depencency on one crop (for the native population, there was no problem for the English) caused the death of millions through famine and its associated diseases.<br/><br/>Because Malthus was proven wrong about the relation between population growth and food production you assume we will innovate our way out of the present impending disaster. I may hope you are right, but I doubt capitalism is up to the challenge. Greed trumps all else.

151
Mr. Brooks' column is exhibit A for the argument that extemism on the Right has redefined what even those few remaining common sense conservatives believe is "left-wing." My guess, and hope, is that Hillary's bet is that her so-called "base-mobilation" strategy is in fact a mobilization of a majority of American voters whio are alarmed at what David Brooks now calls "moderation" on the Republican side. And, God forbid, it might be the direction she really feels the country should take. Leadership trumping horse race mentality? Fancy that.

152
College football is basically the South’s “pro football”. Generally speaking, southerners have a rooting interest in their regional NFL team, but they passionately support their college football team. In order to understand what happened at UAB, people must understand this fact.<br/><br/>Yes, it’s true that the US as a country have misplaced priorities. Sports trump more important issues such as our crumbling infrastructure and our subpar educational system. If we’re to become a better nation, this must be reversed.

153
I respectfully disagreed. Those who allow "security" to trump their constitutional rights will loose both.

There is something awesome about the spectacle of presidential wannabes (Romney, Bush, Cruz, Rubio, etc) loudly trumpeting their credentials as fiscal conservatives (not to mention exemplary Christians) while wallowing in the most excessive displays of ostentation, vulgar materialism, and self-indulgence. This guy is only 44, but comes with a laundry list of goodies that would embarrass a sultan of the old school - numerous houses, pools, speedboats, fancy cars, private schools for his 4 children, a wife with a vanity company, a wallet full of credit cards, too many loans to count, and, of course, the all-important sugar daddy underwriting the whole extravaganza. <br/><br/>You have to wonder if they ever wake up in the middle of the night and think to themselves what a total fraud they are and what a total pig-like mess their whole existence is..... nah. That would require an ounce of discernment and self-respect.

The fact that CBT significantly outperforms prescription sleep meds should be common knowledge among the public, but if my patients are any indication, it is a closely guarded secret. <br/><br/>A child of the 60s, I remember well the frequent, government-produced public service TV commercials, along with a variety of public service pamphlets that shipped from Pueblo, Colorado. These covered topics such as home fire and safety tips, what to do if tornadoes strike, how to perform the Heimlich maneuver etc. <br/><br/>Then came Reagan, who effectively ended these services, employing some ridiculous "evil, big government" rationale.<br/><br/>Today, with advances in medical care - and advances in peddling dubious pharmaceuticals, supplements, electronic devices that "melt away" fat etc - the public could really benefit from objective, unbiased guidance in medical/health decision making.<br/><br/>Most of my patients are not aware of the necessity to go to the emergency room the minute symptoms of stroke appear for possible administration of medication that can eliminate or lessen the severity of strokes. In fact, some aren't aware of the symptoms of stroke - although they are able to recite lists of the latest pharmaceuticals to treat a variety of conditions. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, with Reagan, and then the Democrat's shift to the right with Clinton, the notion that the government had a responsibility to protect and provide pertinent information to its citizens which trumped the rights of commerce, was erased.

I'm in my 2nd month of year 92 and a survivor of Patton's 3rd Army across Europe. I've been an Atheist since 1938 after reading Bertrand Russell. Atheists dig faster and deeper foxholes ^o^ I do believe a little wisdom has finally started to emerge and here are some links I think worthy of note, on my decades old website: <a href="http://www.burlgrey.com" title="www.burlgrey.com" target="_blank">www.burlgrey.com</a>  The talk I gave in 2008 on "what it means to be human" is linked on the bottom of the page. Reading the text is better than the youtube. Then in 2012, is the deepest stuff: Arcane, but not intentionally so!  <a href="http://hplusmagazine.com/2012/12/10/c-o-n-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-i-s-m/" title="http://hplusmagazine.com/2012/12/10/c-o-n-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-i-s-m/" target="_blank">http://hplusmagazine.com/2012/12/10/c-o-n-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-i-s-m/</a> Should be worth at least 2 cents ^o^<br/>My best aphorism: Forgiveness trumps truth because it unlocks love an enables relationship.

Please, compare our health care access to the dozens of other countries that leave no one out. Not to the objections of off the wall Gop crazies. That just responds to the way they define things for us, and leaves out the true contrasts that would spotlight our shortcomings. <br/><br/>Please discuss how in other countries they achieve h/c for all at lower costs? How do they tax, and how do their govts negotiate medical prices with insurance and drug co’s and hospitals? In your world travels have you discussed this with anyone, Mr. Krugman?<br/><br/>Make the Gop rw crazies respond to those specifics, instead of just responding to their absurdities. Turn the tables on them with positive real world examples!<br/><br/>The red states can refuse b/c the US let’s states rights trump equal protection in matters of health/life/death. 24 states, 5 million people, I read? No other nation lets states op out of whatever they want, They know that democracy means  equal protection. Do dozens of other nations even need Constititutions with equal protection clauses? Or do they just do it? <br/><br/>It’s a human rights violation that a citizen’s geographical location and the whims of governors can block access to medical care. In the 21s century!  But I guess it’s the norm for a nation that let’s the death penalty be decided by the states---ok, you want to keep barbarism that most other advanced countries banned long ago? Go ahead, this is a free country, and we wouldn’t dream of imposing anything on you.

As is often true, politics trumps judicial honesty and objectivity in this instance.<br/>Dentists perform dangerous invasive procedures under anesthesia that can result in blood loss, drop in blood pressure, or worse. Yet dentists do not have and are not required to have admitting privileges to area hospitals. It is unnecessary. With an emergency, they proceed as do other outpatient clinics, by instituting life-saving measures by properly trained and credentialed personnel and calling for an ambulance. With hospitalization, care is handed off to the appropriate institution.<br/>There is health-care associated need for admitting privileges by the clinic performing the abortion, no evidence whatsoever that this arrangement improves outcomes. None.<br/>Hence, this is a judicially dishonest ruling and the court should be ashamed of itself for contending that these measures are done with the health care interests of the clients.

159
Greece hasn't made enough of the best card it holds - its geographic position is the trump card that northern Europe is not paying enough attention to.  <br/><br/>Northern Europe should spend some time talking with their military experts about Greece's neighborhood, and some undesirable security scenarios that might arise if Greece exits.

If one man's (I assume Scotty is a male based on my possibly wrong cultural assumption) definition of the unborn is such that it has the same rights of the living breathing mother, it is a contortion of the reality of birth to fit one's preferred ideolology.  To the best of my knowledge all living citizens, including pregnant women, breath air and have birthdays. Fetuses do not and like tadpoles turning to frogs, they are not frogs until they turn into frogs.  With humans that has traditionally and practically been at  the moment of birth, separation from the mother and breathing air.  If you think the rights of unborn fetuses should trump the rights of living breathing citizens under our Constitution I suggest you must in effect support a Christian version SHIA law which I call Chino (Christian in Name Only) law.

161
The court, by agreeing that having admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, shows how very little they know about the way medicine is practiced and that they had little interest in being educated about the subject.<br/><br/>When your doctor goes home at the end of the day, and you need services whether it is a phone call for advice, or to be admitted for a heart attack or even the delivery of a pregnancy, chances are great that a different doctor will be the one you see.  Will you get inferior care?  No.<br/><br/>To agree to that trumped up provision of the law is a very striking sign of how little the judges know, or refused to be informed as to what constitutes safety.<br/><br/>What a mess those judges chose to create with their ignorance.

162
We are not talking about 9 month fetuses and most of us never have except in dire emergencies where the mother's life is threatened. <br/><br/>What we are talking about are the rights of our fellow citizens who are born, have functioning minds, and are recognized as American citizens, including those citizens who are women. For eons of time and including today, in most societies including ours, one is for sure a person when he or she is born and is breathing air, no longer dependent on the mother's womb from which the baby emerged. <br/><br/>What one is before birth is not clear and has been a contorted subject of ever ongoing debate from a variety of standpoints; religious, scientific, legal, and ethical. At what point is a sperm and an egg clearly a fetus and what is a fetus?  Is it a person or a blob of yet to be defined cells. When does "personhood" start if not at birth?  We call it "it" until we identify the sex and often until or just after birth. Are tadpoles frogs before they emerge from the water? When do they become legally frogs.  Is a fertilized egg a chicken? <br/><br/>Since this nation is founded on the principals of separation of church and state (including church dogma) and the  freedom to pursue one's interests and happiness, I believe the rights of a woman to choose must always trump any laws that impose another's will on the woman who must confront this most important personal life decision. Mother knows best, not the state and certainly not the church unless the mother agrees.

163
If what you say is true, then Justice Roberts wasn't doing his job properly in 2012, which lends credence to my own gut feeling (from listening to the confirmation hearings) that he lied to the Senate at that time and that he is debasing what should be an independent branch of government by deciding along ideological lines rather than legal ones.<br/>The fact remains that the plaintiffs themselves did NOT suffer any adjucicable damages, and King v. Burwell was trumped up by an antonymically-named right-wing "think tank."<br/>Taking the case was improper, and the repercussions for deciding the case for the soi-dise plaintiffs will be disastrous, not only for the GOP (which will be correctly judged by the majority of Americans as the antithesis of the public interest and the Constitution), but will also possibly lead to a revolt by those given what in effect is a death sentence by such a decision.

164
I can speak for me when I say, "Thanks for having me mom", after the doctor wanted her to abort me because she had caught rubella around the end of the first trimester.<br/><br/>But I support a woman's right to an abortion - her right to determine what to do with HER body trumps any rights that fetus has - until the fetus pops out and is alive on its own.

165
Mr. Friedman's assertion is false.<br/><br/>There are hordes of prospective employees,  but the jobs don't exist.<br/><br/>This is why businesses can demand a college degree for menial jobs and also why they require employees to work harder for less pay and even less benefits<br/><br/>If there were truly jobs available,  the prospective employees would have more bargaining power, which would translate into higher wages and lower unemployment.<br/><br/>This will worsen given the unrelenting assault against American workers caused by automation (which destroys jobs),  globalization (which sends jobs overseas),  illegal immigration (which has added millions of unskilled workers who compete with native Americans driving wages down),  and US tax policy (which favors capital over labor)<br/><br/>These pressures are worsening. <br/><br/>Obama (a so-called liberal) is fighting for the TPP so businesses can ship all our jobs to Vietnam, and allow multinational corporations to trump US trade laws.  Right to Work (for pennies) laws continue to spread.  Automation is moving up the pay scales.  And threatened Amnesty will allow current illegal entrants to more openly take American jobs, which will cause them to leave the labor black market causing openings that will  lure millions more illiterate Central Americans<br/><br/>There simply aren't 350 million high tech and service jobs.

166
This decision makes no sense. It is in conflict with other decisions by the same court.  How can different judges come to such vastly different decisions?  Who is the court protecting? Are they say that Texas legislature choices trump reality?    

167
I am really tired of trying to explain to my European and Asian friends why Americans think that being sick is a God-given right. They cannot understand how a rational country can oppose a single payer system, which has been proven to be the most economically feasible (let alone most equitable and humane) way of delivering medical care to the population. To be honest, I don't understand it myself. Even though I know that ideology trumps self-interest I still cannot believe that people would rather die than accept a "socialist" system. But apparently this is the case. Fine, sacrifice yourself and your children on the altar of tax cuts. Let me just tell you that I lived under a single-payer system (in Israel) and everything the right-wing media tell you about "death panels", substandard care, long waits and so on is a lie. But of course, as long as it fits their ideological narrative, people will rather embrace a damaging lie than accept a simple truth.

168
Againesva, when you hear a line like that from Cornell, you have to recognize some measure of dishonesty. Despite pooh-poohing the idea of a resume, these schools spend a lot of time trumpeting the resumes of their admits. Here's what Johns Hopkins has to say this year:<br/><br/>"The 3,065 students admitted to the Class of 2019 were selected from the strongest applicant pool the university has ever seen. They include award-winning documentarians, founders of businesses and non-profits, patent holders, published authors, and creators of everything from plays, to video game soundtracks, to a self-heating ski boot."<br/><br/>But I suppose all that success is a result of helicopter moms resume-padding, so who really cares, right?

169
Many fetuses are not "viable". Though the unborn fetus hasn't committed any crime, bringing a child into poverty will ensure a painful and difficult life for the parents and the child. It will also practically ensure that most people remain in poverty. Or it will cram more children into our overcrowded adoption system. The life of the adult in any situation trumps the potential life of the fetus. A woman should have the right to do with her body, and her life, as she sees fit.

Washington is a vast, grinding machine fueled by money. It is the capital of a nation that prioritizes money above all else, so that is appropriate. It is therefore inevitable the interests of money will trump the interests of everyone else. The lobbyists are just a symptom of the problem.<br/>Unless the nation's priorities change, this is how it will be: a billionaire elite working with a millionaire Congress via millionaire lobbyists to rig the system in favor of billionaires and millionaires.<br/>The people, of course, could take back the country by electing a new Congress and a forward-looking president to shake things up (as they did in 1932) but right now the populace lies dormant, dazzled by the bright, shiny things of the entertainment and sports industries and divided against itself by insidious rightist propaganda dominating the airwaves.<br/>Will the nation awken? 

171
Fact:  the charges were dismissed for procedural reasons only.  Fact:  the US Soccer Federation can suspend anyone for whatever reason they feel is valid, as can any other sports league.  (There is an in-house appeal process, and legal options, but the first move is always by the organization, because it is a private-- not public-- entity.)  Fact:  it seems pretty clear to most people that Hope Solo is not a particularly wonderful roll model.  (Do we even care that this team, of which Solo is an integral part, is representing the United States of America, and thus should in theory represent all that is good about this nation and its people?)<br/><br/>Based on the above, the conclusion here is that she rightfully could have been suspended for the recently discovered allegations against her, and probably would have been were she a player of lesser stature.  That she not only has not been but is being celebrated instead speaks volumes as to the quality of the everyone involved-- not just Solo but her coaches and teammates (who laud her participation while ignoring her deplorable behavior).  And the fans (short for "fanatics") who care only that he team score more goals than the opposition.  <br/><br/>Yet again, the need to win at all costs trumps common decency.  Yet again, on an international stage, the true American value system is on full display.  Personally, I am rooting for any one of the other twenty-three teams to win the World Cup.  If there were any justice in this world...

172
There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence, some of it reported in The Times, that health insurance rates and out-of-pocket costs have gone up for moderately well-off Americans. They see themselves, through these increases, as paying for the subsidies. That perception has provoked a backlash against what are presumed to be the redistributive aspects of the ACA.<br/><br/>Despite all the good news about the ACA trumpeted by President Obama, this fly in the ointment could work against it in the Supreme court. 

173
A fetus cannot be 'killed at any time'.  Most abortions must be done in the first trimester.  And no, life is not the be all end all.  Quality of life sometimes trumps life.  Please Google 'hydranencephaly' and 'anencephaly' to learn about just two of the many reasons why a woman might need an abortion.  It is immoral to make a nonviable infant suffer, nor will the health care system provide for all.

174
You might consider buying "Porgies", which are plentiful right off NYC. They are the exact same species as the Mediterranean"Dourade", Dorado" or "Orata", which is trumpeted all over the restaurants in NYC, as "sea bass". They are fresh, reasonably priced and firm fleshed. Black sea bass, available at any fishmonger in Chinatown, would also serve the purpose, and it is a local fish, caught off NY Harbor and the Jersey coast.

175
It's hard to know whether to chime in as me or as a response to other posters!<br/>In contrast to many so far, I took IT'LL, ULT and EST as gimmes which I filled in on the first pass through the clues. And I grow and use ALOE, so I do not consider it crosswordese, a term I apply to (my favorite example) NLER and the ilk.<br/><br/>The Harmon mute is one of the most used mutes for brass instruments and is normally referred to as a Wah-Wah Mute, so I have no kvibble with Wah for the muted trumpet sound clue.<br/><br/>I guess my only kvibble was with the range of hidden gems - they all fit the two-word pattern ---GE  M--. I wouldn't have minded a little Vegemite or a Burning Ember in the mix!

If he were really that traumatized, surely there are avenues other than assault for working that out. He didn't frighten that girl, he assaulted her before waving his gun around at a bunch of more or less innocent kids. <br/><br/>No, I won't be cutting him any slack. He cast the first stone from behind a badge, which tends to trump a high horse.

177
They did not "take away our industries" no one can do that without a great deal of help from us.  We "gave away our industries" in a corporate race-to-the-bottom, chasing ever-lower costs.<br/><br/>The predictions that the Cato Institute continually trumpeted 15-20 years ago, promising that giving China lots of business would lead to Democracy and human rights in China are laughable, and, regardless, were simply a ruse, used to market a campaign encouraging pursuit of higher profit abroad, plain and simple.<br/><br/>We "gave away" our industries, quite aggressively. 

178
The loudest anti-abortionists tend to be people who see things in facile terms. We take a grave misstep if we assume that, because Roe v Wade was decided decades ago, it's time for pro-lifers, so-called, to give up their struggle. I doubt this will ever be an issue that fades entirely from sight in the way opposition to racial integration did. Only when people come to see that it's codswallop to say that a blob of protoplasm has any interests, much less ones that trump those of its sustainer, will the issue recede to the fringes.<br/><br/>Lacking subtlety in their reasoning, many people have an aversion to the idea of "killing" what they believe to be a soul (although isn't a soul an indestructible object?) residing within this lump of tissue. Personally, I think Roe v Wade got it about right. A sense of self isn't even possible until the cortical neurons are linked together by a system of synapses. We cannot adhere to the definition of personhood given to us by religionists; we need to take into account what the evidence suggests and what the verifiable truth is.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that Texas and other states are trying to rescind reproductive rights. But we must continue to advocate for, and provide arguments in support of, our point of view in order to change the public's perception. This won't stop until we succeed on a larger scale than hitherto.

179
These people let their narcissism trump all respect for nature. They shouldn't be held up as role models for anybody. Good riddance.

180
Our social history's conventions about status have always meant more than our true racial differences, which really always have been at times negligible, ambiguous. contradictory and hypocritical. The fact is that our legally classless society has well-defined class markers of social identity that usually trump color divisions in business market research, education, and politics. Whereas once upon a time major insurance companies redlined mortgages to some urban addresses, or, just the reverse, now they devise mortgage schemes for low-income populations. And higher educational institutions now call former ethnic quotas "affirmative action." Meanwhile, politicians like Hillary Clinton run for office to shatter gender bias against female politicians based on bloc-gender political appeals reinforcing gender "us v. them" gender divisions. As though men and women are not all mixed-gender, both of a male and a female parent. (And since we're all both male and female, would it be absurd to call ourselves one gender name?) Racial history, likewise, means less in reality than social status at a given time. The term that most applies to "The Myth of a White Minority" is the emergence in the USA of what Caribbean islanders call "local whites," the historically mixed race ruling classes of countries like Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and other South American countries who describe themselves as socially "white," by appearance alone, not ancestry.

181
This reframing of the ideological divide as beneficial in the USA is untenable without extracting faith-based, opinion-based ideology from policy implementation. But first, call me silly, it's often nice to give the progenitor of a line of research credit as it provides a certain 'continuity' to the history and evolution of an idea, hypothesis, theory, etc. Irving Janis, Hayek, Hovland, and many others made observations on Groupthink, Attitude, and Political decision-making long before Scott Page was born.<br/><br/>The modern GOP platform 'is a danger to the life and liberty of others" and suggesting it's beneficial to entertain as valid the deniers of Global Warming is ludicrous. And what shall we do with their arguments on behalf of austerity during economic downturn? That cutting taxes on the richest trickles down? That free-markets exist and regulation is harmful to a society? That somehow these ideological stances strengthen debate is nonsense that only FauxNews or those who trumpet belief as equitable partner to fact can delude themselves into believing; belief should have little place in our policy-making when science and overwhelming economic data exists. There's a reason the Right often moralizes against education &amp; scientific method. And, unlike what is intimated here, is far more often engaged in vitriolic ad hominem. <br/><br/>Diversity is a good thing but not at the expense of rational thought and some people are corrupt &amp; stupid and I see no reason to equivocate in this matter.

182
what is trump, really? a mouth with bad hair. what does he actually manage himself? his make up artist for a TV show. <br/><br/>true, trump is a master of self promotion, and that's an essential trait in any politician. <br/><br/>but presidential campaigns are gruelling, punishing, humiliating marathons of carefully scripted ambition. my bet is that trump has become inveterately lazy and terminally vain. lazy? it's so much easier to *claim* you have proof that obama's birth certificate is forged than to actually *show* the proof to the world. vain? can you imagine the donald letting a campaign consultant tell him what to say, or face press scrutiny every day for more than a year?<br/><br/>no, trump doesn't have what it takes to run for president. even as a clown or debate show pony. he'll preen a bit for the media, take a few shots at candidates he doesn't like, then go home to sleep in his penthouse -- while he still owns it. 

183
Why does the right of an "unborn" trump those of the already born mother?

184
The folks fighting the Kiev government in Eastern Ukraine (Donbas) are fighting against a junta imposed on the Ukrainians by a foreign sponsored (NATO) coup d'etat.  Why wouldn't any  freedom loving civilized person, as in a subscriber to the rule of law and legitimate governments, not support the so-called rebels in Eastern Ukraine?  How can the Luhansk and Donetsk fighters be called "terrorists" for fighting to preserve their own lives and communities?  <br/><br/>When will the NYTimes quit trumpeting this State Department propaganda and facilitating the oppression of folks living in Novorossiya?  It is understandable that western interests want to get their hands on the natural resources and fixed capital of this heavily industrialized part of Ukraine.  It is also disgusting for supposed journalists to support this spectacularly vulgar wealth and power grab as a supposed counter to Putin and Russia.  A Russia I might add that is neither occupying a foreign country, nor is supporting with billions of dollars per year other allied countries occupying and oppressing indigenous populations.<br/><br/>Does believing in honesty, stating the facts above and not buying the NATO propaganda make me a Kremlin troll?  We will see if this gets published or not.

185
THE 99% NEED NOT APPLY  Once again, the interests of Wall Street trump those of Main Street in the new, secretive ways in which drugs are priced.  Giving control of generics markets and price-setting by big pharma are only the latest chapter in tilting the economy toward the benefit of the 1% at the expense of the health and survival of the 99%  So, the handwriting is on the wall.  Time for the engineers of TPP to read it.  Time to put limits on the limitless greed of Big Pharma.

186
"...stop justifying and promoting them by our own government."  Please provide the link to the advertisements the government sponsored that "promotes" abortion. <br/><br/>'...stop financing them from my pocket"?  Join the world of taxpayers, Mr. La Porta, who each have a laundry list of things we do not like our taxes supporting, to wit: the military-industrial complex, subsidies for NASCAR/Hollywood, bailout for big banks, subsidies for farmers to NOT grow food (in a country with children with nothing to eat), salaries for most members of Congress, etc. Add all of that up and you will see that the monies spent on abortions is minuscule in comparison. <br/><br/>I would rather my taxes go toward free birth control for any woman who can't afford it.  And if the woman who can't afford a child will be forced to bring it into the world because you said so, then will you personally be paying for its upbringing?  The Christians (the GOP) refuse any efforts to increase access to birth control.  Pure hypocrisy.<br/><br/>You want to "let these women know" about "the killing of their own children."  That is you imposing your Christian mentality on "those women".  So, in a democracy, why do your beliefs trump everyone else's?<br/><br/>And please explain how you are "into-woman"? If you meant "anti-woman," your attempt at justification because you have a "loving wife" is meaningless.

187
Lies, lies, lies. Every time the minimum wage has been increased in the past, employment has increased, because more people have more purchasing power, which, in a consumer driven market, means a larger economy and more jobs. Real economists, including Paul Krugman, look at this real world, hard data and acknowledge it as fact. Ideologues continue to trumpet the line that raising wages kills jobs because it's convenient to their goal of increasing wealth for those who have the most money already. 

188
I would disagree with the conclusion about bonds and rules being thinned to filaments, as if the long history of adherence to theological dogma was significantly superior. Our rights, here in the USA, are given by consent of the majority. None of that happens with blind reliance on ancient scripture, yet almost all our modern rights have some basis in moral codes tied to words written to support monotheistic dogmas. Views of social liberalism (not a singular construct) reflect evolving decisions as to which strands to add or strengthen, and which to stretch thin--but this is an ongoing tug-of-war. Changing views are not divorced from older theological concerns (even for self-professed atheists).<br/><br/>The remark that those favoring assisted death believe autonomy trumps rules against self-harm is twisted. Those who favor the option are more likely to recognize that there is an end to a decent human existence in the face of genuinely intractable illness and that there is no need to prolong suffering. One can reach a supportive stance if you get rid of the singular notion that a heartbeat defines life. This is not an issue necessarily defined by a conservative or liberal political stance.<br/><br/>On a more general level, there is little reason to think that the entire world is becoming more socially liberal, that our group values of personal freedoms and rights are in ascendance worldwide.

189
LL Bean is where it's at! My 17 year-old self would have fainted to hear her 37 year old self say that, but it's true. Quality trumps. 

190
I am not sure organizations like Planned Parenthood or NARAL that receive federal funding and private donations cannot find sponsors to upgrade some of the abortion clinics that do not meet the standards laid down in Texas and other state laws, and bring them up to the required standards so that women seeking abortions, no matter when - first trimester or within 24 weeks, can get them safely and in compliance with the laws of the state. <br/><br/>Mind you, laws are passed and signed by people who are elected by local electors, and legislators are beholden to their constituents. In Ireland, they legalized gay marriages through a referendum. That was people's will (read: majority of people's will). If a referendum were held in Texas about whether or not abortion should be legal, a majority opinion would be against it. But the Federal laws trump state laws. However, here the state is not banning abortion but merely imposing standards PERCEIVED to be unjust by, surprise surprise, uber-liberals. <br/><br/>If the liberals care about women's reproductive health and 'freedom', they should come up with the money to upgrade those facilities that do not conform to the state standards. Whining is for babies; adults deal with the problems and solve them.<br/><br/>Let us be adults here, folks.

191
Obama is belatedly accepting the stark fact that american strategic interests are being harmed by the jv.<br/><br/>But he can't thnk strategically,<br/><br/>And, he has no support,<br/><br/>And, no policy or rationale,<br/><br/>And, his non strategic concern, that has trump power over all strategic concerns is that he foresees the bvious, that if the U.S. does what it takes to destroy ISIS,<br/><br/>Iraq factions will stab the US and each other in the back, as usual, <br/><br/>There will be an international spectacle of innocent civilians killed, and americans tortured and killed, for which there will be no good answer.<br/><br/>So, he dithers with a policyless policy, which may be what americans want even though it is foolish.

192
ACA is a bit better than what we had before, so along partisan lines, it's a winner. But health care should trump partisanship - there are choices outside of the narrow Democrat/Republican consensus that the private, woefully inefficient health insurance system should be retained.  <br/><br/>Despite decades of mainstream media propaganda against single-payer/Medicare For All, the public continues to favor a national health plan because the public understands that simply having a health insurance plan does not equal access to affordable medical care.<br/><br/>I'm surprised Baker went to bat for ACA - he surely understands that the private insurance model will bankrupt the country at some point (I believe I've even read him stating that). If he fears that the SCOTUS will rule against it, he's also forgetting what a boon ACA has been to the private health insurer's bottom line, something that does not escape the justice's attention, Roberts anyway.<br/><br/>They will most likely vote along partisan lines but Roberts will save the day for ACA, as he did a few years ago.

193
The example of what worked was from England, a tiny nation with a parliamentary system.  To me that is not a convincing example, since England is already more socialist than we are - for example their national health insurance, which is now supported by all sides.<br/><br/>Here in the U.S., where there is a lot of gerrymandering, Congress is becoming more and more divergent as the right and left grow further and further apart.  Likewise, ordinary people now tend to read and watch their preferred political media - where little discussion goes on other than one-sided views.<br/><br/>Families have literally split due to strongly differing political views.  And in my experience few individuals from either side ever seek to persuade anyone any longer.  What I notice is people seeking out only those they know share their values if they want to discuss politics.  And people simply clam up when someone does present views that they, mistakenly, assume others also share.<br/><br/>The theory presented may be nice in the abstract.  But I see little evidence of it working in our current social milieu.<br/><br/>At the moment psychology is trumping philosophy.

The problem is that there is no dialogue.  There are simply side-by-side monologues.  The other problem, which others have pointed out, is the denigration of respect for expertise in our society.  We used to be able to sort out disagreements, in part, by asking experts to share data and knowledge to help us make decisions.  50 years ago, you would not have had Rand Paul (a doctor, horrifyingly) endorse the idea that MMR causes autism, when all the data is against this idea.  Now the experience of my neighbor's best friend's sister-in-law trumps your science.

Since their deregulatory policies helped cause the whole mess in the first place, the VSPs aren't about to admit that "mistakes were made." It might cause them to lose track of all that lethally concentrated wealth and power that they keep sucking and sucking from the body politic.<br/><br/>Blair, Osborne, Cameron, Bush, Greenspan, and yes, Obama and the GOP,  are carrying on the seriously evil tradition of Reagan and Thatcher, putting the needs of capital above the needs of the citizens of their allegedly democratic governments. This capital is transnational, thus making it both easy and possible for Obama operative Jim Messina to travel across the pond to re-elect another austerian to power. As made painfully clear by the ongoing Congressional food fight over "trade," greed now trumps national sovereignty.<br/><br/>A servile mass media, owned by the same "folks" who own the politicians, makes the metastatic spread of bad ideas possible. (A case in point is Rupert Murdoch's global empire.) Instead of educating the citizens, they turn struggling people against one another. Divide and conquer works every time. Modern-day racism and xenophobia didn't just spring up on their own. They got help from Fox News. <br/><br/>Instead of getting out and talking to the people whose lives they've helped ruin, leaders function as a paranoid sales crew. The only things they have to offer us are fear and endless wars. They call it "progress."<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be this way. We either fight back, or we perish.

An important point worth making is worthy of repetition.  Professor Krugman is spot on in observing again that "serious" ideas always seems to absolve the powerful of the consequences of their decisions.  <br/><br/>Let's make an effort in the US to counter the other "serious" and equally incredible narratives about the origin of the US-led financial crisis.  First, we heard that it was the Community Reinvestment Act that caused banks to make subprime loans.  When even some of the mainstream banking institutions choked on that whopper, the serious people shifted to accusing profligate poor people egged on by Fannie Mae as the heart of subprime mortgage lending.<br/><br/>Fortunately, in the short window of 2008-2010 we managed to make some important positive changes in our financial regulatory system. There has been shockingly little reporting on the success of this regulation.  New credit card regulations have wrung out hundred of billions of dollars in bank fees without any substantial impact on credit access.  The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has brought a series of amazing enforcement actions returning billions of dollars to consumers in just the first few years of its existence.<br/><br/>The success of this partial re-regulation of the financial system needs to trumpeted, defended and ultimately expanded.

Dear God man, in what universe is it normal to have 30-yr olds living at home and searching for themselves? Their lives and the colleges they attended are as they are, pathetic and aimless, because those colleges are run on free-market principles, with the profit motive trumping education and abolishing the hard word to wasters.

For most human beings, feelings trump reason.  The only hope I see for getting through to people is to find alternate feelings that conflict with the ones that are causing the most harm, and appeal to those contradictory feelings.  <br/><br/>Once I figure out precisely how to get that to work, I'll let you know......

We as a country have truly lost our way. When there were 13 colonies, we were needed by England for their economy. But the oppressive character of their economy with it's intolerable acts was a one way street. <br/><br/>Mr. Obama, the Harvard socialist shows his true leanings by going in the direction of NAFTA, a disastrous failure for American workers and a great system for large corporations who chose to outsource their operations. Back office and support for banking and computer tech is not in America. These could have been jobs for tens of thousands of Americans at the very least. <br/><br/>Cities in the US are dying by the boatload and will get worse with this TPP, being negotiated in secret. <br/><br/>Where is the good in it for Americans? Ah, the businesses and corporations who will be favored!<br/><br/>The secrets in this bill will surely trump all US laws, federal, state and local to favor corporations and nations who are part of the trade agreement and trump all labor agreements so that it has the ability to destroy whatever is left of the US and it's once great way of life. <br/><br/>Shame this administration and Mr. Boner. If Boner agrees with this, you know it stinks from the head down. <br/><br/>All elected officials in the house and senate who vote for this deserve a special place in history where they will be remembered for their anti-American stance that favors foreign regimes and corporations over what used to be proud and productive American workers, soon to be disenfranchised.

You mean disinformation like Romney didn't pay his taxes?  Politicians lie, that's what they are good at, and Obama and the stooges who helped pass Obamacare may be the best in the biz.  Keep you doc, premiums will go down, health care costs will not keep spiraling out of control.  And the biggest lie of them all, "can't know what's in it till you pass it"  or some such outrageousness.<br/><br/>Here's the truth.  My premiums have gone up over 50% since ACA was passed.  I have to pay all my insurance so the increase is obvious to me, whereas for those who work for a company that picks up the majority of the insurance tab, a 50% increase may not be that big a deal ($100 to $150 doesn't look as ominous as $1000-1500 -- particularly if it's a pretax account.  <br/><br/>And employers look at the total pay package, salary and benefits and forms of comp so if benefits costs go up, guess what won't go up nearly as much -- other forms of comp, particularly salaries.  <br/><br/>And for those who trumpet that the rise in health care costs have slowed, think again.  We're in an overall low inflation era with artificially low interest rates and a slowing economy, so if health care cost growth rates have also slowed, do you think that's due to the ACA or is it due to the overall economy slowing?  <br/><br/>So no what was this disinformation you were talking about it and which side is most responsible for spreading untruths about ACA?

Unless high-income parents will foster low-income youth and raise them as their own (think big tax credits) class differences will always trump educational opportunity as the determinant of success.

The person who is ill (the uncle) did not make the request for privacy.<br/> It's not even clear from the wording of the letter that the uncle's daughter's mom is in a current relationship with the uncle. Was she his wife, his ex-wife, the mother of his child but hadn't spoken to him for years, what?  Did the uncle's daughter possess less of a right to share the news than the daughter's mom?  I think the letter writer knows more than we do about his/her family relationships. If the letter is any indication, this is a family that does not communicate clearly.   I don't think there is an absolute answer to the question as phrased, but if it were my family, and I withheld that news from my mother, or my children withheld that news from me, it would be very, very hurtful to all.  I would definitely have told my mom.  Mom always trumps my uncle's daughter's mom!

What you saw is but one example of the right-wing agitprop in action.  Its their SOP.  I spent a few days at the home of a friend who was an avid Fox-watcher during the time of the Iraq invasion.  Hour after hour announcers would breathlessly announce that troops were rushing to secure a reported chemical dump here or seize a cache of WMD there.  What they NEVER reported was that the troops showed up and found nothing there. By the end of a day or two you'd think the country was just crawling with the stuff.  <br/><br/>On issue after issue, that's what they do.  Standard media might be faulted for reporting on alarmist claims without following up when they are found to be false, but the mouthpieces of the right don't just report bad news (although, for some reason, only the bad news concordant with their views) but they trumpet it!

206
I was a bit disappointed with this movie, mainly because I had high hopes for it. I remember seeing Jurassic Park in '93 and was completely blown away. The second two were alright but nowhere near the suspense of the first one. After years of hearing on-and-off news of a new Jurassic-film, I was happy to see this one materialize, especially with Chris Pratt taking the lead (playing a  character who relies more on his instinct rather then being a learned scholar, trusting on his education to get where he needs, an interesting take on a bigger issue whether education should trump everything when it comes to evaluating a person for he is capable of).<br/><br/>However, I felt this movie went rather fast through all the prior history of what was the base for Jurassic World (the old park vs. InGen vs. where we are today) but this is hands down a great summer blockbuster with a new attraction that certainly delivers. Without spoiling too much, I felt that there was a certain connection to another movie franchise in regards to weaponising living things and believing that humans are in control of it that I thought was very intriguing.

I hope those who support the TPP will take a closer look at the true nature of opposition from many, many American voters. These Americans are not isolationists or opposed to globalization, instead they are opposed to the very flawed nature of this particular treaty including the way it was written by mainly corporate interests and how it is skewed heavily in the favor of those interests.  Among  specific concerns are the TPP's Investor-State-Dispute-Settlement (ISDS) provision which would allow a multinational corporation to bring a lawsuit against a state or local community in the United States because that state or community has laws protecting the health, safety or economic well-being of its citizens that the corporation perceives as standing in the way of potential profits.  Such a suit would be held before a tribunal that is appointed under ISDS for that particular dispute rather than in the existing U.S. court of law whose jurisdiction applies to the state or municipality.  Treaty law trumps the laws of individual states of the United States including the constitutions of those states so a lawsuit brought under the auspices of the TPP could realistically result in staggering financial costs on individual states or local communities -- a situation that could cause them to 'give in' or 'pay up.'  This is un-American and anti-democratic.

Culture always trumps strategy.The changes required of Greece as a condition of further financing (increasing the tax base,reducing business regulatory burden and state pension obligations) will only happen with cultural change which is exactly what the current Government Does NOT stand for.Further,even if introduced,implementation would take years or worse.While Austerity may well be counterproductive,the measures outlined in this editorial are pure fiction.

A disinformation campaign by Obamacare's OPPONENTS? <br/><br/>LOL. Look who is talking! From day 1, bereft of all but the flimsiest evidence, Paul Krugman has been trying to talk up Obamacare. If Krugman sees disinformation campaigns everywhere, it is in large part because he is seeing his own reflection.<br/><br/>True, last year approved increases were smaller than requests, but as Robert Laszewski points out, (1) unlike last year, the carriers now have hard data to show the insurance regulators, and (2) a 35% increase is not suddenly going to become a 5% increase. <br/><br/>The point is not that Obamacare has failed, but that Paul Krugman jumped the gun when he instantly pronounced it a success; and he did that because he chose to use his bully pulpit at the NYT to try to spin the debate over Obamacare. With Krugman, politics always trumps economics.

There are probably as many reasons to be homeless as there are people on the street. Whether you are the working poor, a destitute veteran suffering from mental illness or a Google software engineer, you need a safe place to sleep.  However, in recent years, our shared common human needs seemed trumped by a kind of “Red America and Blue America” where we economically live in an alternative universe. The “income challenged” did not “work hard enough, study, etc. and deserve it”, while we who doing well, sure of our superior moral net worth, fixate on tax credits and our view remaining unblocked by a four story affordable housing project.<br/><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/17/george-lucas-wants-to-build-affordable-housing-on-his-land-because-weve-got-enough-millionaires/" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/17/george-lucas-wants-to-build-affordable-housing-on-his-land-because-weve-got-enough-millionaires/" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/17/george-luca...</a>

Part 3, McKibben to Obama:<br/><br/>If you begin to strand some carbon beneath the earth, the wisdom of investing instead in renewable energy will become even clearer.<br/><br/>And it’s with that renewable energy that you can make your final mark on this debate. Solar power is a very different animal [now] ... a panel costs 75 percent less today. It’s gone... to a completely possible change, and though you’ve waited too long to be the politician who really exploits that fact, you can make sure that everyone in America at least knows about the new economics."<br/><br/>"Solyndra is long-forgotten ... and every poll shows Americans of all political stripes love solar panels. ... Green Tea coalition pushing for progress ... We need you ... reminding everyone that far more people work in solar than in mining coal."<br/><br/>"make the climate talks in Paris more ... At the moment they look set to ratify a global temperature increase of 3 or 4 degrees C — that is, to lock us into a kind of slow-motion guaranteed catastrophe. They lack a vision beyond the mediocre (and unenforceable) targets that countries are now producing. But given the changed economics of sun and wind, the talks could be the moment when the world commits to electrifying every house on Earth with a solar panel on the roof. That’s now not only possible, it’s a practical and a moral imperative."<br/><br/>"physics doesn’t care about political realities ... Physics just cares about carbon. Reality reality trumps political reality."

Rep Peter DeFazio of Oregon was just interviewed on the news and he said that he has read the document and that it does contain the concerns people have voiced against it such as the tribunals that would be set up to adjudicate suits by multinational corporations against the laws of sovereign nations (including the United States) that those corporations claim are standing in the way of their potential profits.  Laws affecting health, safety and  economic well being that citizens pass to enhance quality of life in their communities could be challenged.  Treaty law trumps the laws of individual states of the U.S. including state constitutions so decisions of such a tribunal could be devastating to Americans' freedom to govern their own lives.  This may affect Americans in all aspects of their lives -- where they live, work and play.  

213
It's a form of bullying your fellow citizens and neighbours. The fact that so many Americans have weapons also makes policing extremely dangerous. Every encounter that the police have with a citizen has the potential to be lethal and that impacts how the police act and often over react with the public. Almost 500 people have been shot dead by the police this year, those are staggering numbers in any society, yet still no political leader will dare confront the NRA. The concept of "Freedom to carry arms" needs to be redefined and should not trump the Freedom to walk down the street and go shopping peacefully.

214
I have failed to see any real benefit for the American consumer with any of these free trade deals. Why does a shirt sewn in Sri Lanka where a person makes less than $10 a day cost $50 ?  Why does a washing machine made in Mexico or China cost $600 or more?<br/>US corporations are reaping huge profits and whittling away profits with high executive salaries and trumped up expenses to minimize taxes. 

215
Another example of "narrative" trumping the facts. If I believe it, it's true and others must accept my narrative even if its ridiculous (like changing my race or gender). 

216
Yes, Gail, there are no standards like double standards.<br/><br/>The last time the NRA was in FAVOR of gun control was when it was intended to 'control' the Black Panther Party, and racism somehow managed to trump even Second Amendment absolutism.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, supporters of concealed carry have previously argued that weapons should not be displayed, as such might tip off any would-be violent perpetrators regarding whom to target first.<br/><br/>Obviously, the NRA hasn't merely gone from "right to bear" to "right to flaunt."  They've gone from "Have it your way" to "Have it both ways."<br/><br/>(Apparently, some folks also seem to think they have a right to 'overbearing' arms, as well.)

217
This has a lot more to do with gender than with race. The question we should be asking is: why is victimhood an integral part of gender identity for so many women? In one direction, somebody uses trumped-up victimhood as an excuse for a publicity-stunt "art project", carrying a mattress around with her. In another direction, a woman born with white privilege seeks to disown her race and claim the "benefits" of being a victim of racism. Why do so many women see being a woman as in some way claiming an inherent, even exclusive, right to victimhood, and why must that victimhood be perpetual in nature? Both of these examples are simply performances of gender identity.

218
If the TPP is as wonderful as the White House claims, it should release all 800-odd pages of the draft to the public, right now. It's the undemocratic secrecy of the thing, the threat to prosecute Congress members who divulge details of a corporate coup on steroids that is so outrageous.<br/><br/>As Wikileaks reveals, the section about investor tribunals supplanting sovereign judiciaries is so odious that it has been ordered to remain classified for four years, post-ratification. Therefore, the administration's claim that all will be clear and bright once Congress approves fast track is just a bunch of hooey.<br/><br/>By the way, the narrative of "dysfunction" that PK rightly criticizes is blared prominently in today's front page article by Peter Baker and Jennifer Steinhauer. We learn nothing much about the actual TPP, but a lot whole about Obama getting stabbed in the back by dysfunctional Dems; the usual veiled criticism of a shrill Elizabeth Warren sucking up all the oxygen in the room while a calm Obama tries to seduce the fence-sitters; the Davos types belittling Friday's vote as "a nasty little issue," and anonymous White House sources characterizing Nancy Pelosi as borderline-senile. <br/><br/>Journalism in the plutocratic interest trumping journalism in the public interest is on full display in today's paper, unfortunately.<br/><br/>I hope that as the TPP tango plays out, PK will evolve from his lukewarmth and get as hot under the collar about this corporate coup as the rest of us hippies. 

219
What we are talking about is: Some people think that their perceived 'right' to not be offended trumps other's constitutional rights. Sorry, but there is no constitutional right to not be offended by the activities of your fellow citizens. Sorry.<br/><br/>The nonsense style of writing in the editorial and your, obvious, attempts to provoke reactions by mentioning what you think are hot-button firearms clearly shows your agenda. (As does your appeal to 'save the children' gambit.) That's okay, I have an agenda, too–preservation of ALL constitutional rights.<br/><br/>This editorial offends me, can I prevent you from expressing yourself? I have a constitutional right to express myself, you say. Of course you do. Just like all Americans have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Reckless disregard of the effects of exercising your 1st amendment rights can be much more deadly than any firearm, yet I don't want to chill your free speech. Respect other's constitutional rights. That's what it costs to live in a free society.                                                               

220
What you think does not trump others rights.<br/><br/>As for the open carry.....<br/>States like Ky have open carry as legal without a license. Anyone can do it because it is Constitutionally guaranteed.<br/>To carry concealed you have to pay for a class, pass the class, get permission from the sheriff, make multiple trips to various different places, pay multiple fees, pay renewal fees, go through a waiting period, be fingerprinted, have a background check, have a picture taken, be required to carry a special id card, and various other infringements.<br/><br/>Some people would rather conceal carry but the hoops you must jump through to do so are burdensome so they just open carry because most gun owners follow the law.<br/><br/>Gun laws only help criminals and hinder law abiding citizens.

221
What you think or how you feel doesn't trump my constitutionally guaranteed right.<br/><br/>Do you also think that black people should be subjected to the same process as concealed carry licenses before exercising their 14th amendment right not to be a slave?<br/><br/>Because the same arguments can be made.

222
Anyone that paranoid is sick and should be institutonalized. If the government can forbid  weapons of any kind in schools etc., they can certianly ban the possession of firearms on an airplane and even in the airport. <br/><br/>The peoples safety trumps the "so-called right" to bear arms anywhere.<br/><br/>This situation is ludicrous and the individuals sh0uld either have given u the weapon or been arrested.<br/><br/>The airport security guard or TSA officer should have removed this gun him and possibly him and his gun from the airport.

223
You say it outrages police?  That seems hardly the case in southern Oregon.  County sheriffs in this part of the state are quick to defend open carry, the gun carriers' 2nd amendment "rights" trump the rights of ordinary citizens to feel safe in public.  The sheriffs even object to background checks involving private gun sales.  Guns are instruments of death and intimidation.  Never forget that.  This is lunacy!    

224
If the charges were dropped because the so-called victims didn't cooperate and the situation came down to she said/he said. what basis would the Soccer Association have to suspend her?   What happened to "innocent until proven guilt" ? It seems like anyone can say anything about any athlete, true or not, and people want that person suspended.  To compare this to the Rice incident, where there was absolute proof, is absurd. Domestic violence is a horrible thing, but that doesn't mean we go on a witch hunt and convict people right or wrong, This whole thing could be trumped up by disgruntled relatives who wanted something from her and didn't get it.

225
Ah, those pesky questions of objective vs. subjective attraction, and power-over (do it my way) vs. power-with (what questions could we explore to get client closer to goals?). While armchair critique may not serve, as the good Dr. DJH has edited the case for a nimble column, I wonder if Greta could be helped to identify what her vision of a perfect relationship looks like. Kayak trips? Oenophile pillow talk? Then take the steps to join groups who do same, with only the goal of enjoying the activity. People embodying their passions/interests have a way of being attractive despite wardrobe/hairstyle setbacks. Character shines forth, trumping stereotypes. Our dear Greta sounds wan and lackluster, regardless of appearance. Connecting a client to their vitality and pleasures in life is a skill; referring to groups, teachings, etc. if not one's own forte. Awkward conversation arising from stereotypes, and gender issues is not necessarily germane.

226
Mr. Obama foolishly plays right into Mr. Putin's scenario which he often recites to the Russian people:  Russia is being squeezed by America.  The trumped-up danger from America is a useful lever for Putin in blunting popular protest to his excesses of power.  This development will not intimidate Putin.  Instead, there will be more tension.

@John Cahill: ...and I would add we must be a nation aspiring to a sustainable future -- which will take ALL of the energy of our share human psyche. Aspirations used to be based on who looked the best and had the most, and how to be fair about it. All racial sufferings are based on that, and you are right, none of us can afford that concern as we face a future that will be entirely about sustaining human life on the planet. We are in the post-racial era, not because we've gotten over racism, but because it isn't the elephant in the room it used to be. Our shared environment and our future in it has trumped it.

229
I serve on an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for medical research. Privacy regulations under HIPAA are strict and specific; abrogating these privacy rules can lead to sanctions up to and including stopping the research. All researchers believe their studies are important and for the common good; many believe they should be exempt from obtaining informed consent because that would be inconvenient; very rarely does the IRB agree. Protections for children should surely be at least as stringent. Informed consent includes ensuring that the study subjects understand what is being done and freely agree to participate. No research on children that includes identifiable information should ever be permitted in the absence of informed consent of the parents. Your desire to do research does not trump a child's right to privacy.

This is the essence of the problem with GMO's: the future risks are still mostly unknown and unfathomable.<br/>The law of unintended consequences trumps human hubris.<br/>Monsanto proclaimed its Round Up resistant seeds as "the answer."<br/>Time has proved that claim completely wrong.<br/>Hubris cannot be the guiding principle of science.<br/>And science is hugely inefficient when harnessed to the service of freewheeling predatory capitalism.

This is unbelievable, that picture--- It is so hard to know if the Neo-cons and warmongers are literally turning up the global heat or if this truly is a threat.<br/>I don't want our allies to feel unsure of our support or unsafe.<br/>But where is Germany and the rest of Europe, in their own backyard? Why only us?<br/>We're the only ones in this scenario who have recently unilaterally invaded a nation halfway across the globe on a trumped up purpose, one with no relationship to us culturally or historically. And destabilized an entire region that it continues to engulf. And here we come again with our big guns.<br/>Meet the new boss, same as the old boss: Colonel Jack D. RIpper.

The American public is angry and that is not going away. They are angry about the very things Bernie is taking a stand on. Maybe we will see if faux rage from Fox can trump real rage from Main Street. <br/><br/>The American people loved, loved, loved FDR. Nothing the GOP and oligarchs said could change that. I think Bernie, unlike Obama, would agree with FDR when he said the rich and powerful hated him and he "welcomed their hatred." The trouble with Obama is he foolishly feared their hatred and wanted them to like him, sort of like a hen going on a date with a fox and expecting an engagement ring instead of an axe.

FMike says (and we have to assume with tongue in cheek), "And even as a pacifist,."<br/><br/>Nothing in his comments sounds like a pacifist. But if he were, his analysis is bogus. Comparing a capitalist Russia in 2015 with Nazi Germany of 1933 is beyond the pale. <br/><br/>Russia has always had its dark leaders. Russian humor is based on hundreds of years of Czars, commie overlords, a drunken American favorite and now Putin.<br/><br/>Russia has also had a fear of the outside and the many rather recent invasions of Russia by Japan (American ally), Britain (American ally), America, and twice by Germany (now an American ally) can only feel, touch and smell like America's final death plan for Russia. <br/><br/>Think about it: the USSR (actually Russia) gave up its desire for world conquest without firing a shot. It had the weapons to go down in flames and even as a last resort could have stated that unless (whatever its terms) it would take the world with it. But it didn't. Walls came down and the world was changed except for America's need to have an enemy and wars to keep its imperialist and colonial hegemony alive. <br/><br/>Instead of taking the high road, America took a low road and expanded the concept of military right trumps all our<br/>slogans and propaganda about the Four Freedoms, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the statement at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, and the Gettysburg Address. Instead it could be said that the Address of Gettysburg was changed to P.O. Box 1%, USA.

234
It would be nice to think that the Obama Administration is finally getting around to giving Poland and the Baltic States the support they need against Russia's increasingly aggressive moves in the region, but, it is equally likely that this is once again a case of domestic politics trumping foreign policy.  Did anyone notice that this "proposal" surfaced at the exact time Jeb Bush was visiting Poland and Estonia? In domestic political terms, the timing is perfect for spiking any headlines Bush might have gotten for calling for more military support for our Eastern NATO allies.  Too bad that Bush didn't take in Ukraine on this visit.  If he had, we might be hearing about new White House "proposals" to increase military aid to that beleaguered country.  I remain very, very skeptical of the White House on this one.

235
Anyone out there remember the concept of the "common good"? Obviously no one in D.C. does. Today, party loyalty trumps doing what's best for the entire country with compromise and a grasp of consequences flung out the window. Partisanship, pandering to special interests, power grabs and political games and the public...the folks that pay the bills and shed the blood be damned. The American people deserve better.  

236
We have known since the1920s  (really since Roman times) that leaded gasoline was dangerous to human health and would be deadly in enough concentrations. Standard Oil had workers who died horrible deaths from lead poisoning. They worked in the  refineries adding tetraethyl lead to gasoline to prevent engine knocking. The government was about to ban the lead additive, when Rockefeller had a chat with President Coolidge. Suddenly it was all reversed and we added lead to gasoline until 1986. If they were not going to make the oil companies remove lead, they sure weren't going to make paint companies do it. <br/><br/>The sad part is that marketing from the businesses, trumps science and information. So any regulations are looked at as negative, and a PIA, a responsibility to be shirked, rather than looking at the whole picture, and what it is doing or has done to millions of us. <br/><br/>Remember, smoking was marketed as "healthy" because it made the businesses LOTS of money. Anyone who spoke against it was muffled. Until people started really looking at what smoking did.<br/><br/>Watch the Poisoners Handbook, on The American Experience, pbs.

Susan,<br/><br/>AO has posted loads of good science just in this thread alone, I take note that you do not dispute any of it at all, just him personally.  Further, I am sure even you would agree that his science and maths training and experience trump yours by a wide margin.  In other words, you seek to 'beat' something with 'nothing', a concept that only works sometimes in so called climate science when practiced by folks like you who are in such reverence for authority that you are prevented from realizing the depth of the data in opposition to your position, which AO points out so well.<br/><br/>While your point about expertise is fair, in climate science it isn't fair - this because the data speaks to anyone who can read it, no special skills required.  The same for the failures between experiment and observation, and the prediction/projections and the observations.  In these areas anyone with a functional mind can take in, process, and conclude.  Some of us go farther and learn more.  You should try that for a change.

Richard,<br/>Our many years together and my wife's science education have informed me that it takes more than a nimble mind and strongly held beliefs to have a constructive argument. My wife and yourself are in danger of losing their country because belief and bluster are trumping scientific evidence.<br/>Why is the evidence of the 1950s and the lifting of millions of people out of poverty so difficult to understand. Poverty seems to be just another crutch in the totalitarian arsenal of making the conclusion mother to the evidence. Poverty seems more than anything a product of insecurity. You suggest that poverty is a consequence of a healthy society in which insecurity is a necessity.<br/>The constitution of the US was born out of the argument between Jesus and Satan in Milton's Paradise Lost. Both sides presented impeccable reasons for why it is better to serve in Heaven or why it is better to serve in Hell. Jefferson the scientist that he was looked at the evidence and took the side of Jesus. This is not to say that Satan was wrong as most of us think with our gut rather than looking at the evidence.<br/>I think however that in democracies our use of poverty to affirm our beliefs is amoral at best.<br/>Proving to ourselves that we are correct too often prevents us at looking at the evidence being presented.

The arrogant attitude of bureaucrats, researchers, and corporations that they have a right to our children's data without consent because they are supposedly doing good things with it, because it is too expensive to get consent, or the federal government wants to know if their unconstitutional and largely ineffective programs are working is unacceptable.  The amount and type of data desired and gathered on students without consent is growing exponentially with a Politico investigation showing that corporations are gathering up to 10 million data points per student per day.<br/>Appallingly, it is the same reasoning being used by the National  Assessment Governing Board to justify their plans for unconsented affective probing of student "mindsets" &amp; "grit" during the NAEP and the plans to fund and promote socioemotional research in the Institute for Educational Sciences reauthorization (S 227) in Congress.  The furor over this psychological profiling will make the opposition to inBloom look tame.<br/>The fourth amendment rights of innocent American children are not abrogated at the schoolhouse door.  Their right to have their data be secure from unconsented research and their thoughts &amp; attitudes secure regardless trumps the ease, convenience, &amp; profits of adults every time.  Senator Vitter's bill is long overdue. Any of its perceived excesses are the result of this insatiable gathering, careless use of, &amp; disdainful treatment of our children &amp; their unique information as commodities

Can we never get rid of George W. Bush and his "two-month" Iraq War boys?  It seems not.  Now they have seemingly cropped up again trying to get the U. S. into one of their endless "two-month" wars by shipping tanks and heavy weapons to Russia's neighbors.  This group is great on feeling "humble" for our veterans when it comes to Memorial Day speeches but the same people are callously forgetful of the death and suffering they are responsible for when they get us into unnecessary wars for their own trumped up reasons.  Bernie Sanders may be our only hope for some honesty and common sense.

The problem isn't the rich, it's the plunderers - yes, a noticeable subset of the rich. Not wealth, but vast, vast wealth, buying governments, giving themselves get-out-of-jail-free cards, etc. Privilege trumping Justice.<br/><br/>Not to wave the flag too hard, but the country was founded by rich white guys who wanted to see at least a measure of justice tempering privilege.<br/><br/>Being rich isn't an impediment for arguing for more justice and less privilege (personal and corporate) than rules now. But the right would really like to frame the issue as dirty hippies, and "those people" vs the Successful Americans Who Deserve to Keep What They've Earned.<br/><br/>Gotta reframe that to Privilege now trumping Justice.

242
Josh,<br/>The Magna Carta has little relevance to America and its constitution except to those who would see the law trump justice. If the constitution was to echo The great Charter it would have been written in Latin or French.<br/>The American Constitution does echo the Jesus side of the debate in Milton's Paradise lost. I am not an academic but reading Milton criticisms such as<br/>The Complete Critical Guide to John Milton University of Illinois Press should convince anyone that the Constitution was about justice not law.<br/>It was Oliver Cromwell who demonstrated what the Magna Carta could do and it took Cromwell's secretary to show us a better way.<br/>The law sometimes is truly an ass. The Barons did pass laws outlawing tedious academics and Cromwell's England was made a Hell on Earth. 

243
The final sentence here is brilliant.<br/>A DEFICIT of common sense.<br/>Common Sense: Something Thomas Paine trumpeted at the onset of the American revolution. The Republicans claim they have it; they don't.<br/>But more than just common sense, we have a deficit of understanding. A deficit of compassion. A deficit of intelligence.

If only it were that easy! Transwomen are harassed daily and arrested on trumped-up charges of solicitation for prostitution.<br/>"Being Kardashian" is a two-edged sword. It provided Caitlyn Jenner with enough publicity to shine light on transgender issues with the public at large and to enable Americans to acknowledge that it is more common than believed, instead of simply a matter for esoteric erotica or hate. Unfortunately, as "reality" TV stars famous for being self-promoting without any real other talent, many people (including myself) don't think much of the Kardashian klan.

245
The democrats need to learn how to promote their agenda and trumpet their successes. For too long republicans shout about the supposed benefits of tax cuts to the wealthy, climate change denial and all other manner of policies that have proven disasterous, and yet still get traction without any real challengesnfrom th epolitical media. Frank Luntz and Roger Ailes have built a powerful RW propaganda machine while the left can't even effectively counter policy that clearly does not work, much less make a case for new policy that might work.

246
The TPP failed because it is awful for American Citizens - it takes away their rights and transfers power from them into the hands of multi-national corporations. Right now Uruguay and New Zealand are being sued under similar trade agreements for tobacco labeling like in the US and the US just lost a suit over meat labeling. See the op-ed piece in the NYT about tobacco labeling by Michael Bloomberg a while back. Profits or expected profits cannot be allowed to trump the rights of citizens. It is hard to imagine what Obama was thinking when he continued to push this though.  

247
No it wasn't Divine right is part and parcel of the Magna Carta the Magna Carta simply divvied up Divine Rights. Habeus Corpus for those of us who are mere mortals are still not clearly established even now in 2015. Wrong time, wrong colour, wrong side of town still trumps habeus corpus.  

248
"...cannot commandeer the doctor-patient relationship to compel a physician to express its preference." How is it, then, that states (e.g. Florida) can prevent via legislation physicians from discussing with their own patients how firearms are stored in the home if there are children? How? Because the unbridled power of the NRA and its "sacred" Second Amendment trumps the FIRST Amendment. G-d save the United States! 

249
Actually, that's the basic mantra of corporations everywhere. If a corporation could make a profit killing random toddlers on the street, they'd do it. The only reason they don't is because that's illegal (yes, government), and the penalties they'd face, both criminal and civil, would likely far outweigh the profits they'd make. <br/><br/>Corporations are amoral. They exist to make a profit and little more. The only bulwark the average citizen has against corporate depredations is government (regulatory agencies, the courts, the cops, etc.). While the GOP is unabashedly in the pocket of corporations, increasingly the Dems are little better. Just look at Obama trumpeting the so-called benefits of the agreement - one he won't let us read! <br/><br/>I never have and never will vote GOP. But I'm increasingly skeptical of the Democratic party as well. It's naive to pin all the blame on Republicans. Yup, they stink alright, Obama's "trust me" stance on TPP is insulting and a sell-out of American workers, and of anyone who breathes air for that matter.

This could have been a better article if directed at younger people. So my comments are directed at younger people. For older readers, it is what it is.<br/><br/>My wife and I recently are our early 70s, married 50 years both from rather humble beginnings. My wife retired from teaching at age 38 to have our two daughters and I retired at age 48 to move from LA to the country in Pacific NW. We were fortunate to have a well paying jobs and house two years after our graduate degrees. Now have more money than ever.<br/><br/>So what's the secret? No. 1 you can't change, others you can.<br/><br/>1. Be born at the right time, 1940s to 50s.<br/>2. Get a good education.<br/>3. Buy a house in a down market.<br/>4. Never buy a new car. My limit has always been $5k and keep it forever.<br/>5. The easiest way to save money is not to spend it(easy for a Norwegian).<br/>6. Don't play the market, find a good income stock and stay with it(I've had the same stock for 25 years and still pays 8%.<br/>7. Don't get divorced, even if experience trumps hope.

Being a single mother does not imply that there is not a man involved in her life and or in the life of the child or children. But that is beside the point here. We need to talk about Jeb Bush. Regardless of what he states now in order to appear as a wise, patient, tolerant, and kind man his past record of public experiences indicate he is none of the above. He is the original that his brother was cloned from and we know where that got America. By voting in a Bush America is guaranteed another war on trump-up claims and a half-reasoned saber-shaking monologue of how brave we are to send our sons and daughters over where ever while we continue to show our heartfelt patriotism by continuing to shop until we drop. The Bushs live to see their investments grow while others are too busy mourning the deaths and hardships of a half-baked war designed to do only one thing: increase the financial well-being of munitions and contractors of war.

Cinderella just met reality.<br/><br/>What could be more iconic in America than Disney, Microsoft and California Edison.  <br/><br/>The answer apparently is greed, cynicism and corrupt politicians.<br/><br/> Snow White just got trumped by the GOP.

Once again a wonderful example of GREED and "survival of the fittest" selfishness trumping "We the People".

254
I do not believe this critical attention on the abuses of this program means anything at all. It is only coming up because there is a rush to look concerned about American workers in order to provide cover for the TPP. I say that because I have followed these issues for at least a decade. All of these concerns - with these same companies! - have come up before. Nothing changed because the program exactly the way it is suits corporate interests and that trumps American voters every time. We don't need to fix this program. We need to end it. We need to stop all elitist corporate trade policies across the board. 

255
A sad story, emblematic of times in which cultural and realpolitik pressures induce otherwise honest, capable people to provide untruthful information about themselves. The need to "conform" in order to serve, to advance, to be oneself can trump one's commitment to truthfulness. Being oneself is truly a hard task in the collectives which make up the world.

Basketball is a Team sport and a MVP could be looked at as the player that had the greatest impact on winning the Championship, which is the point of the series.  Consistent team defense and efficient team offense will trump all.

The research supports that for weight loss, diet trumps exercise. You simply cannot "out-exercise" poor diet. However, for weight maintenance, exercise trumps diet. If you want to avoid weight regain after losing weight, you must get regular, fairly vigorous physical activity. When you lose weight, even if it's mostly fat, you simply burn fewer calories at your new weight. For most people, it's nearly impossible to stay at that new weight without exercise. However, you won't get there in the first place unless you focus on diet.

260
Ll my claims rest on the data and the observations trumping the thesis or experiment as Feynman taught us to do.  The rest is theatre, brought on by your madness over being constantly "corrected" with fact and data rather than alarm from authority. <br/><br/>If some characters are quite correct, they deserve to be noted, if some warming-deities are wrong they deserve to be noted too.  So far it is Monkton's projections that have proved out and your authorities who run from him as fast as they can, as he has invited them to nationally televised, and smaller, debates, yet they run and hide commenting about his eyes (he has graves disease) or peerage (which is quite real if not ancient). <br/><br/>In then being right or wrong is all that matters and learning along the way.  What we have learned so far is that the alarm was misplaced but intransigence has stopped us from correcting things when the facts changed. This is a travesty.

Ms. Dolezal is a troubled person, but it is not surprising. Her parents are members of some bizarre ultra-fundamentalist Christian group that denies evolution. She was raised and home schooled in an atmosphere where belief trumps actual fact, where humans can live inside whales, virgins conceive and give birth, and the dead rise from graves. She was steeped in magical thinking, and seems to really, sincerely believe she has lived a genuine black person's experience, and therefore it is the truth. <br/><br/>My fear is that with the political attack on public schools since 2000, encouraging religious private schools with public funding, and permitting unregulated home schooling will result in more and more of these belief-based individuals, completely unequipped to function in normal society.

262
'A 2011 study in Pediatrics found that parents preferred that physicians use terms like “weight problem” and “unhealthy weight,” rather than “fat,” “obese,” and “extremely obese.”'<br/><br/>All the easier to deny reality with, my dear.<br/><br/>With all the emphasis on sensitivity rather than reality, doctors have been forced to toe the line of political correctness, even when doing so results in patients not doing what's necessary to get better. Perhaps a reintroduction of bluntness would save some lives in the long run, even if parents are forced to acknowledge that little Johnny isn't that little anymore. <br/><br/>If someone wants to ignore their doctor's advice, fine. It's their life. But when they ignore their pediatrician's advice, that's a whole new ball game. Kids are completely dependent on their parents for food, shelter, and health, and as such parents not doing what's objectively best for their children should be dealt with more harshly than they usually are. They don't like what the doc has to say? Too bad. My medical education trumps your hopeful denial.

263
Why wouldn’t agrosen8's rationalization—that a liar’s feelings trump any ethical obligation to be honest—apply as well to the lies of all con men, regardless of the alleged nobility of his motives? This woman lied. She didn’t tell people, “I’m white, but I sure feel like my skin color should be black.” She said she was black, or partly black. Her psychological problems don’t alter her genetics.

264
"...an atmosphere where belief trumps actual fact"<br/><br/>You mean like when a man can pretend he's a woman, or a white woman can pretend she's black?

265
Views promoted by Fox News, National Rifle Association and others of that type result in personal posititions trumping public good. These right wing extremeist care for no one else but themselves making them truly dangerous.

Having been spent many years in and out of the education game from the 70s to the early 2000s, I can attest that the faculty of a school certainly know who the "bad" teachers are, long before a principal knows.  At the high school level, the kids know too.  <br/><br/>The one district I taught in back in the early 80s was as child-centered as could be and it showed.  We worked in teams (middle school level); had team planning time to discuss methodology, individual students, etc.; evaluated one another for purposes of improvement; and success of the school and students was a model statewide.  Of course, being in an upper middle class community where education in all areas (including art and music and physical fitness) was prized. <br/><br/>Don't forget the GIGO factor--garbage in garbage out.  Clean up a community's poverty, change the culture of multiple children out of wedlock being ok, provide jobs, healthy food choices, etc. and watch how children bloom.  Quit blaming teachers for all of society's ills and politicizing the education process.<br/><br/>If we are going to give states the right to trump federal in all things, let's take it one step farther and let the communities control their own schools as well.  Get rid of all the insane testing requirements.  If the community can't get their act together and produce schools that produce solid citizens (note I'm not advocating the production of brilliant high scoring test takers), then that community deserves to be trumped by a private school.

If Jon Snow is really dead and if Arya is permanently blind, I will give up watching GoT on a regular basis. That is, I might check in from time to time the way I used to before I decided to commit myself to the series. Without some justice, some happy endings, GoT is just a long, grueling -- though magnificently produced -- story about how good doesn't trump evil afterall. How depressing.

Caitlyn Jenner "comes out" as a woman, says she's has been "identifying" as one for a while, and gets a Vogue cover and reality TV show.  The press goes gaga about how "courageous" she is.<br/><br/>Rachel D is outed by her parents because she does not "identify" with their genetic ethnicity, and even though she has made tremendous strides for race relations in her community, she gets vilified by the press, accused of "deception" and mocking those with black skin.  Seems to me that she is the one with the more pure intentions, but I guess LGBT trumps African America once again.

269
We have known for sometime that profit and power trumps many socially important issues. It goes far back into history and can be exposed by shinning a light on manipulated facts. The facts in this case need to be better represented, and there is a part of the difficulty.  The right is flooding the information world with layers of commentators, cherry picking data and obfuscating the truth. The left stands still and points at these pieces of data and say, "it's not true." They don't fight facts with science that others can understand or find a common ground on. <br/><br/>You can call someone a denier, but they look at the oppression of deniers. It is different argument when a denier is confronted with real scientific facts. Climate change is such a vast set of scientific data, that doubt is easily sown.

Let's simply LOOK AT HIS RECORD:<br/>1. Terry Schivo-religion trumps medicine every time. I don't mind you believing in stupid legends, however in THIS country, the LAW comes first, and you made one up and passed it to pander. It was declared unconstitutional, of course, and you were wrong. Period.<br/>2. Resolution Trust-Americans can't remember anything that happened more than 1 second ago, so they have forgotten your family's, including Jeb's, crooked past regarding this little "situation." Look it up, people.

Education-supposedly "fixed" education in Florida. We are still among the worst, and PROUD of it! As a parent once screamed at me in the principal's office: "My granddaddy couldn't read, I can't read, and I will be durned if you gonna teach my son to read!" Florida education in a nutshell after bush.<br/><br/>There are many more instances of his terrible tenure as governor of FL. As president, the US will see guns, religion, war, and tax cuts for billionaires as the agenda. Enjoy!

271
One thing in particular that calls Brooks' arguments into question is that he hasn't read the bill because it's been kept secret from the public this whole time. So if TPP is such a great deal, why not let everyone read it?<br/><br/>That being said, this article reads like it was written in defense of NAFTA in the 1990s, promising more jobs, telling us not to worry about losing manufacturing jobs because the service sector will make up for them and presenting all kinds of scary scenarios if the deal isn't enacted, while trumpeting the benefits for people in poor countries. <br/><br/>The problem is that said service jobs are either the kinds that pay minimum wage and no benefits or require advanced schooling, which costs a lot of money (in the form of loan debt) and creates a glut of unemployed students with bachelor degrees, ultimately exacerbating inequality as the manufacturing jobs that used to make it possible to earn a middle class income without college are automated or moved to cheaper countries. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Japan, South Korea and Germany have managed to keep much of their high-paying manufacturing jobs and continue to run trade surpluses with the U.S.<br/><br/>I'm not supporting any of these deals until I see them come with some heavy-duty protection for American workers and this country's economy, as well as policies that require or incentivize companies to invest and hire domestically while forbidding and disincentivizing automation and moving production abroad.

272
Two words to help global crises in every poor country- from Central America to African countries to Somalia, to Yemen, etc.  birth control.<br/>There are simply too many people and not enough water, food, jobs. We are already  out of control. With fewer people, perhaps the next generations will have a chance. Right now, human life is very cheap making humans targets for illegal smuggling, human trafficking, and of course, the ever popular, suicide bomber and cannon fodder. We need to help promote a world wide campaign for smaller families and predicate any US aid on the result of having fewer kids. BTW, we should also do it in this country. Religion usually gets in the way of common sense practices, but perhaps money does trump all.

273
... and I do not see Jenner doing anything to advance womens rights.  <br/><br/>I do not think it is LGBT doing the trumping. I think it is white male-ness.

274
Atrios just destroyed the thesis behind this piece. The assertions about NAFTA are demonstrably untrue. Op-eds are still supposed to hew to journalistic standards, no? Or are factual findings trumped by gut-feeling in the world of elite opinion?

275
I have known very dowdy people of both genders that I still found very attractive because they exuded confidence in themselves and inner peace with their "conventional" unattractiveness. The common denominator was usually a keen sense of humor and outgoing warmth which usually always trumps physical beauty. <br/><br/>Greta's conflict no doubt was her thinly veiled contempt/fear of her own sensuality. Clothes are our most immediate and profound indicator to those we meet of our inner state of mind. We tell the world how to approach us through our presentation of our bodies. (You never get a second chance to make a first impression and first impressions are very difficult to change.) Dr. H should have investigated what criteria she was imposing on her potential relationships and if it bore a disconnect from reasonable expectation. Was she doing the rejecting preemptively?<br/><br/>Some here are making this into an argument about the sexist absurdity of assuming a hyper-sexual, femme fatale persona. There was no evidence that Dr. H. tried to do that. There is a broad and accommodating middle-ground. Dressing as though you have a healthy amount of self love is not the same as looking like you're desperate for attention and it need not involve killer shoes and breast implants.<br/><br/>There is someone for EVERYone out there, no one should ever feel forced to conform to our culture's standards of attractiveness. 

276
Uh, as a liberal I think integrity trumps all, and Ms Dolezal has none.<br/>And the liberal media have, in point of fact, been extremely careful and critical of her credibility, including the piece you are now commenting on.

277
"I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney".<br/>Spoken like a true, well heeled thug. But, I must admit, if one is a billionaire or multi-millionaire, then one can run for president; that's democracy!<br/>That there is even a scintilla of a chance this man may become president then the "system" is even more broken than I thought.<br/>Too bad Justin Beiber is Canadian for his credentials to run a country are equal to Mr. trump's and he's a lot more talented!

278
It's mind-boggling how many people trumpet a lifetime of serving oneself as a qualification for serving the nation - and how many people buy it.

I have had deep respect for Mr Brooks, but this is disengenuous horse manure.  First, TPP is not free trade, it is pre-agreed anti-competitive pie slicing at the expense of real people and their rights everywhere.  Second, nothing done in secret is good for the public. Ever.  Innovation requires open exchanges.   Human rights require open accountability. Protection of health and environment requires open and honest accountabilty. Last, corporate profit can not ever be allowed to trump human rights, heath orbenvironment.  This deal is pure evil.  Mr Brooks should be ashamed.

280
Thirty years ago the Educational conventional wisdom was anonymity would create a better learning environment.  Unfortunately, with anonymity came a complete lack of accountability.  No one could track student performance effectively.  And, after all, that is what the discussion should be about, creating an environment where children can learn the skills and information they need to be successful.   The reaction to this system of anonymous students had no choice but to look for the only identifiable players left, the teachers.   What we are left with is a system that has been turned upside down.  While it is not unreasonable to expect to teachers to work hard, and most teachers work very hard, it is the kids who should be the ones working.  Gov Cuomo's vision seems to have forgotten what the real goals are.   Teacher accountability should never trump student accountability.  Even if Mommy gets mad when jr. gets a B.

281
If it would so good for us all, why was it crafted in total secrecy with the enormous input from corporations? What about the language where if say the government of Australia wants to put graphic photos of damaged lungs on the outside of cigarette packages and the cigarette makers sue the government because they say it will hurt their profits? So a good for the people of a country can be trumped by the need for Phillip Morris to make money????? Really? As usual, David Brooks is all hat, no cows.

"Unfortunately, the American dream is buried," said Donald trump. Dear Donald, have you ever wondered who owns this "funeral Agency". You started to install the crosses on the graves of young Americans early in his career. You have achieved this success, and are now trying to bury the whole country.

283
It is interesting that this country claims to be more open, more accepting, more tolerant and yet... this case shows that when it comes to race we are still very closed, and ultimately the pursuit and desire racial authenticity trumps any effort to be more open.  Not long ago, as the author accentuates, white people were looking for reasons why the other couldn't join their exclusive club.  Now we are seeking to divide every race into an exclusive club.  The question then becomes why?  It is true that there was a time when being a non-white meant you were denied certain possibilities.  Now, however, minorities are given privileges denied to whites (e.g. scholarships, grants, govt. assistance, jobs with the minority groups, etc.).  That a woman should pretend to be black to be given these opportunities is interesting.  At any rate, or whatever the ultimate cause, the hypocrisy of the claim of acceptance is staggering when it comes to race in this country.  Ms. Dolezal got in trouble for pretending.  It's ironic, therefore, that we're not nearly as accepting as we all pretend to be.

trump, a nyc real estate developer, doesn't owe favors to anyone...? novel concept

285
Great !!!! Not a Clinton or a Bush.  A businessman and not a politician is what this country needs; someone who will create jobs and is not afraid to speak his mind.  Trump is a leader and has a" commanding presence" (currently lacking)  and understands that the President is President of his company: THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  I hope he "trumps" the current competition.

"Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, for instance, cast a symbolic vote against Blatter in the election last month. But he voted for him in the previous election in 2011, perhaps because his goal of securing the 2022 World Cup for the United States trumped that of removing Blatter from office."<br/><br/>Are you seriously faulting Gulati for voting for Blatter in an unopposed election?

287
this outcome could be even better for the GOP than trump's announcement to run for president

no worries - trump to the rescue

289
Exactly.  <br/><br/>Thirty years ago I threw out my bathroom scale and vowed never to have one again.   I was never obese but my mother and other relatives were so obsessed with weight that they would ask me again and again how much I weighed, asked hadn't I gained a few pounds since they last saw me, instructed me that I should weigh myself each time I stepped out of the shower, was I positive that I hadn't gained a pound or so since they saw me last week, etc. etc. etc. The anxiety level was very very high and subject seemed to trump all other subjects. <br/><br/>When my cousin was being treated for a terminal disease with steroids, the family said "Oh look at how much weight she's gained.  That's why she's waring those drapey clothes"  and then they'd discuss, soto voce, whether she had gained 15 or 20--no,  no, its got to be at least 30--pounds.  That was their focus, not love and support, when she was less than a year away from death.<br/><br/>Those are the reasons I threw away my scale. Thereafter, I had the satisfaction of saying "I don't know--I don't have a scale."<br/><br/>In my family this subject is a sickness.  What we need is compassionate balance, it seems to me.<br/><br/>I am slender, by the way.<br/><br/>Mary

Yes, this IS a Republican problem - not a single one of them voted for this bill and yet not a single one of them has proposed anything to replace it. If the terrible case the GOP trumped up wins, the onus is entirely on THEM to provide a solution, pronto. Of course they haven't one because essentially today's GOP hates any gov't acitivity that doesn't enrich the already wealthy.

292
My initial feeling was that the Republicans were right (I rarely say that) to draw a parallel with Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner. If choice can trump biology in the one case, why not the other? But there is a difference. Bruce did not accept biology as destiny, but neither did he lie about it. 'Lie' is a strong word, maybe too strong (both for Ms Dolezal and Bruce when he speaks of 'living a lie'), but Ms Dolezal did not tell it straight as to who she had been. Plus there is the question of material rewards (affirmative action etc) to which is not entitled.

293
IVF and all of the permutations of assisted reproduction should not, must not, be left to the avarice and greed of an unregulated market. Our courts should not have to decide each case on a sui generis basis. State legislatures need to step up and deal with this. Otherwise you get wildly different rulings, often based upon emotion or ideology.<br/>That California clinic's operation is so obviously offensive (designed Caucasian kids who may end up marrying their siblings, anyone?) that it cries out for applicable statutory intervention. "I want to be a mommy" doesn't trump other societal and cultural norms which shrink from turning humans into commodities. The Europeans, who are as secular as the day is long, heavily regulate all this. Why can't we?

For a true 'picture' of the intent of Republican policy, 'follow the money'.<br/><br/>For a true 'picture' of what it is that gets so many people to vote against their own interest, follow the divisive, emotional rhetoric that they use to promote the  hate, fear, greed, jealousy, and bigotry that trumps both rational thinking and  the economic and physical well being of voters.     Emotional hot buttons simply work better than the truth.    And the truth is that Republicans truly believe in concentrated wealth, master humans, and in 'trickle down', where how, when, and what trickles down is at the discretion of the master humans.<br/><br/>It's a security and a certainty thing that's inherent in their thinking.    If THEY can be CERTAIN that THEY personally are SECURE beyond forever, THEY may find it in their artificial hearts to trickle something down somewhere, sometime.     We should send them a message that we've gotten the bill for their CERTAINTY and SECURITY, but we're still waiting for something other than words for the rest of us.

295
We live in an era when big brother and big criminal, now co-opted by multinational corporations, have advertising budgets and logos, where the US government is for sale, even up to the Supreme Court, where greed and hate trump common decency. As Yeats said at the dawn of the last century: "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."

296
I'm not sure Mr. Friedman understands why so many object so strenuously to the TPP, to NAFTA, GATT, and to the TPP's Atlantic counterpart, also in progress. These agreements not only encourage the export of manufacturing jobs out of the US they create a legal obligation to give standing to foreign interests in US courts. The TPP will, if we agree to it, mean that if we want to protect an industry within our borders, for reasons of national security perhaps, or because we want to put our economy onto a greener path, a foreign economic interest can challenge our right to do so because it violates a trade agreement. If we accept the TPP as written trade trumps all. National security, sustainable economy, climate change, anything else comes second.

297
When you state that the right-wing evangelical base votes consistently against their own interests, you must surely mean "their own *economic* interests."  They vote for their religious and cultural interests when voting Republican; that trumps their economic interests, as they see them.  

298
Ms. Dolezal was wrong to mislead people. But until she was outed by her family, she was apparently well accepted by the Spokane black community.  Perhaps what we have in common trumps skin color and the other nuances communities emphasize to define themselves. Once the embarrassment passes, I like to think that's the lesson that will be left standing. 

299
   Definitions are important, Tom. Freedom can be just a word thrown around by a lot of people who try to limit the "freedom" of others.  Fairness is a little less nebulous and the kind of thing you recognize when you see it. Not seeing it very much of late has created a lot of distrust of institutions.<br/>  That  distrust and past experience is at the heart of fear of the TPP. Will it be fair to the American worker and can we trust what is kept secret from us?<br/>   To your point about centrist, they are hardly in the center today. The "center" has shifted so far to the right that  Bernie Sanders addressing issues plainly and truthfully finds many moderates and independents supporting him. Good policies trump labels.<br/>Today's "populist" movement is just an attempt to bring the people back into what used to be the democratic process and to find solutions for the good of all. You know, fairness! KA

Thanks, Bartholemew Cubbins. Which one's the honest hat? You know...the one in which you're not trumpeting?<br/><br/>Just lay out the science, Adrian. it shouldn't be necesaary for you to try this other guff, let alone repeatedly misrepresent the science.<br/><br/>Seriously, dude...back when you were in school, did they really, truly, teach you to respect the likes of Monckton, Watts, and the guys from Heartland? Did they really?

301
Fechoem44, what you're doing I think is overlooking the fact that the word "race" has multiple senses. In biology, it is synonymous with subspecies. Culturally, in the United States, it may mean have any degree of ancestry of a group other than white -- the one-drop rule. It can even apply to smaller groups, e.g., "the race of Irishmen."<br/><br/>The problem with pretending race doesn't exist is that it's plain to anyone walking down the street that it does, and DNA evidence bears this out. My DNA shows that I'm mostly Caucasian, part sub-Saharan African, maybe part Siberian or Amerind. How is that not real? How does that not correspond to racial makeup? Would you say it's a fantasy that my ancestors came from these places, and have polymorphisms that are associated with these populations -- some of them essentially unique, e.g., without overlap?<br/><br/>I'm also part Neanderthal (3.1%, according to 32 and Me) and it would be entirely appropriate to describe me as part Neanderthal, because DNA *does* establish species, indeed in biological classification these days DNA typically trumps other measures.<br/><br/>But race is *also* a social construct. How else explain that as a boy, I was legally black in some states and legally white in others? The one drop sense is different from the Linnaean sense of the word "race." In the one drop sense I'm black. And finally, in the visual sense, I'm white.

302
I like and respect the Clintons and their work and values, but I think they're on the wrong track in persuading the GP that work and values trumps power - and of course, it's complicated, 'cause even the Clintons arent sure this is true - the the GP is not stupid!  although "human" and prone to Stockholm Syndrome as are even those guys who follow their leaders into the sea - must Google to remember who they are . . . 

303
It's not the criticism that Israel objects to. It's the selection of facts to trumpet every reason to complain about Israel's actions and suppress everything that would provide an exculpatory explanation (such as rockets launched from crowded city streets, pro-Nazi rallies).

304
On the surface of it, regarding Bush's recent statements on the Pope's position on climate change, it might appear that he is at least a bit smarter, a bit more realistic, and a bit more ethical than the other Republican candidates. That really wouldn’t be saying very much though, would it?<br/>At the same time, I think this is the most advantageous position he could have taken: it would alienate only some portion of Republican voters, but not enough to scare away those who would vote for anyone other than a Democrat no matter what, and at the same time it could attract some ‘centrist’ or even some Democratic-leaning voters. Well played Jeb!<br/>Bottom line, though, is that the truth is well-revealed in his cop-out of a statement: “I don’t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope.’’ This points to the surety that money, on many levels, would trump any realistic action on climate change from Jeb or any other President of his party. The world that they all come from, including the Koch Bros. and other powerful groups of their ilk that would contribute so much to try to get one of them elected, would never stand for anything else.

305
The Supreme Court should dismiss the certiorari petition as improvidently granted as the plaintiffs clearly do not have legal standing to challenge the ACA subsidies.  As in the case of Mr. King, the outcome will not even affect him in the slightest.  A trumped up case that the GOP fears they might win and suffer at the polls thanks to Mr. King and his cohorts.

306
Blow complains about the voluntary nature of Dolezl's act and how she could reverse it with some literally cosmetic changes. But what is the standard for "voluntary" vs. being mentally compelled to act (i.e., transgender desires). By saying biology trumps all else, it undercuts all arguments for support of transgender and other "sexes" not dictated by the physical body you were born with. So, is "race" once again some special class onto itself, less fluid even than sex?

307
I couldn't agree with you more.  Nothing trumps authenticity.  For an authentic example of white woman courage personified, Ms. Dolezal need only look to Viola Gregg Liuzzo.  <br/><br/>Ms Liuzzo, a wife and mother of four from Detroit, traveled to Alabama in March 1965 to help the Southern Christian Leadership Conference—led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.—with its efforts to register African-American voters in Selma. Not long after her arrival, Liuzzo was murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan while driving a black man from Montgomery to Selma. <br/><br/>She was the only white female killed during the Civil Rights Movement.  

308
To those who think we cannot make poverty a #1 issue, look at these tragedies and costs.  We cannot afford not to.  Instead of blaming the parents, lets make a generational commitment have a miniscule US poverty rate.  A low poverty rate and strong defense budget can co-exist - since defense spending has trumped kids since Eleanor Roosevelt's efforts 100 years ago. 

309
Governor Haley says we may never know "why," but actually there is a very simple answer: it happened because, thanks to the NRA and some Supreme Court justices, alleged "second amendment rights" trump the right-to-life of ordinary unarmed people (and their exercise of religion).

310
Speaking in strict terms of State laws and Federal laws this decision is not too surprising. Federal law always trumps state law. No one can argue that. But to say that we should "respect the rule of law regardless of when and whether you accept all the laws as fair and applicable" is one of the most unintelligent statements I have ever heard. Did you know it was once against the law for African-Americans to drink out out of the same water fountain as someone who was white? Or that woman used to be barred from voting? Should we just have blindly followed those laws because they were the laws and laws are sacred and can never be changed?<br/>Laws are social structures created by man that change with a society. As a societies attitudes and cultural beliefs change; so must the laws. We need people like Mr. Coats. People who have the courage to stand up to unjust laws. Without them things would never change and we would be living by countless unjust laws. 

311
So many aspects of this terrorism make this horrid incident especially  gruesome.  That the perpetrator was invited into this house of fellowship and worship getting to know his victims for an  hour, then declaring his racist political  need to kill is beyond the pale.  Does politics trump humanity in this country?  If so then what chance does a human being have of surviving here  where we supposedly claim life, liberty and the persuit of happiness as our mantra.

312
beautifully said, I have always said your right to bear arms, does not trump my child's right to live...

313
That's a great question.  I want to know the answer--because evidence suggests that people do have limited will power.  I'm guessing the answer is overweight and buff...I think the benefits of exercise in terms of being healthier older trump the impact of a few extra pounds, but I'm curious.  

314
What do you want the president to do, Tess? He is already being called all kinds of names, ruler, dictator by the hateful whites like Donald trump who even question his nationality and patriotism.

315
Sad part is next week we will be talking about gun owner rights. When will the rights of the living trump that? After the funerals and the grand speeches we always go back to what we do best. Hating and killing each other. Tired of the grand speeches and days of mourning. Will we ever be better than this? Sad part, is for my money, the killer wanted to get caught. He may have acted alone but he wasn't alone in getting to the mindset that got him where he is. Now in his wicked mind he will get what I think he wants. Martyrdom!  

316
Comfort always trumps fashion for me...if I am not comfortable, I will neither look or nor feel attractive.  Simple as that.

317
@Allen Rogers<br/><br/>Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is not harmless. CO2 at 40% concentration is used to euthanize lab rats. At lower concentrations, CO2 traps heat. An out-of-date engineering degree is trumped by modern science.

318
We will never get any additional gun regulation in this country. The pro-gun folks are unwilling to compromise in any way. For them the right to have a gun trumps all other rights- even the right of others to live.

319
"It is leftist code for NO GUNS". This is the crux of what's wrong with this country. Conspiracies and paranoia trump common sense at every turn.

320
This is just another way of saying that property (gun) rights trump human rights.

321
You're ignoring the real questions here: Should we continue to allow sick people to possess firearms, and if not, what should we do to stop them from getting them?<br/><br/>I'm in the camp of "My right to live my life without being shot trumps any pseudo-rights to unrestricted gun ownership."

322
Everyone is focusing on the GUN.  The gun.  The gun.  The problem, in all of this, from the freak in Colorado, to this kid or that kid or the Jersey cop that had "too much going to court", is culture.  Culture trumps EVERYTHING.  Broken homes, drug addled youth, Godlessness, hip-hop music, the booty, and other scenes and words I won't bother to mention all fit with these incidents.  We are a violent nation.  More so today than ever before.  It's not "the gun".  It is us.  And until that weapon changed, I see it only getting worse, and more worse.  

323
Looking at a 21 year old with a childish hateful face who displays an old South African Apartheid flag on his jacket that preceded his birth and a Rhodesian emblem that represents the worse of the present makes me cringe about his future, and ours.<br/>Seeing that his birthday gift was a 45 calibre from his dad makes me wonder what else was going on in that house that permeated his intellect.<br/>This looks like abuse to me.<br/>That nine wonderful people paid for that abuse drives me to tears. Of course, he'll have a whole life to pay for it. Life? What a misnomer and a waste.<br/>How can our second amendment trump the first?

324
"Culture trumps EVERYTHING.".....You are right, but where does culture start. When we put a 15mph speed limit in a school zone, it is not that we are trying to arrest people for speeding, but rather it is to remind drivers that children often step off the curb without looking both ways. If we had a universal background check to buy a gun, it would serve as a reminder to every one who buys a gun, that there are crazy people among us who should not have a firearm. Laws are far more about setting public norms and standards, establishing a culture, than they are about arresting people. And when Congress rejects a universal background check, what is the message they are sending? What is the culture they put in place?  

325
Their struggle wasn't remotely similar to George Washington.  The colonists had no representation in the national government and that government had just declared that it could trump the assemblies in which the colonists had representation at any time.  The South had more than ample representation in all branches of government and a free and fair chance to compete in the 1860 election.  They seceded not because they didn't but because they lost.  Further, given that the South seceded to preserve slavery, the idea that they were fighting to preserve liberty is risible.  There was nothing tyrannical in Lincoln opposing the expansion of slavery in the territories.

326
"The vast majority of legal hand gun owners are quite responsible with their weapons."<br/><br/>Yes, well, the problem is that the minority of irresponsible gun owners can kill an awful lot of people in a very short time.<br/><br/>Think about traffic laws 100-odd years ago. No speed limits, no rules of the road, no need to obtain a license to drive. My grandfather liked to talk about how he and his friends, circa 1910, kept an eye on a neighborhood intersection and would come running when they heard a crash, so they could pick up bits and pieces of the shattered autos for their collections. No stop signs, you see, and no rules about who should cede right of way. Grandpa, a lifelong conservative, fully appreciated the need for regulation. I mean, it was pretty obvious, wasn't it?<br/><br/>That's where we are right now with guns. Only instead of coming up with responsible rules and regulations for their purchase and use, we are held back by a thuggish industry and its flaks.<br/><br/>If someone had stood up at a public meeting in 1915 and blustered, "My right to drive any way I want to trumps your right to make it home in one piece," he'd have been watched closely thereafter for additional signs of lunacy. A century later, Second Amendment absolutionists express the same sentiment all the time and "leaders" like Gov. Haley nod and murmur, "That's right."

327
He wasn't an alienated young man, he was a terrorist, a radicalized home-grown lone wolf of the White Supremacy hate group we've had with us since the Klan.<br/>He's no more mentally ill than the ideology that formed him, generations in the making.<br/>Time for someone from there to step up and take responsibility-- for the constant hate speech, escalated since Obama's election, for the constant "get your guns before the gov;t comes to take them from you", as if that's even been attempted. But fear drives good sales.<br/>Enough. The guns without registration or mental health requirements, the big-clip magazines, the nihilistic kids trying to outdo one another in mass murders, whether for IS, White Supremacy as the Joker. It is a product of our society today and it is insane.<br/>Congress, nice prayer on the lawn but your constituents have had it with our mass murders. Most want reasonable gun control. You all need to stand up to the NRA----do you have the guts? You didn't after Sandy Hook, astonishing enough, but maybe you've had time to think about that.<br/>Now's the time to show us NRA"S money doesn't trump all.

328
Has the USA apologized to its Native American population yet? While we brought black people here in chains,  we nearly exterminated the people who were already here.<br/>   And on the subject of race, how does Donald Trump escape prosecution for hate speech? His comments on Mexican immigrants were as vile as anything George Wallace ever said. Maybe NBC should apologize for keeping Ttrump in the public eye?

329
When in direct conflict, decency and respect for others must trump the need to preserve and glorify one's heritage. We're talking about the flag on the statehouse (and other public locations), not a flag you might have in your study. It's time to get rid of the former.

330
I love my country, but I am not safe here. I am not safe whether I am black or white. I am not safe whether I am rich or poor. I am not safe whether I live in a rural area or in the inner city. I am not safe whether I am man or woman, adult or small child. I am not safe at the movie theatre or in church. My small child is not safe in his classroom. I am alive because of the numbers, sheer luck – probability. Is this freedom? Why does the “right” to guns trump our right to live? Why can any individual who ascribes to any one of many despicable ideologies (white supremacy, racism, radical Islam, anarchy… pick your evil) be able to so easily attain a weapon that can massacre so many lives in so few seconds? Why have we the people allowed this state of affairs to continue in this supposedly the most advanced country in the world? Where can I take my family to get away from this violence? Nowhere, in America. When will we fix this problem? When will enough be enough? Why can’t we find a way to balance an individual’s right to protect himself with citizens’ right to stay alive?

331
It's easy to dismiss whole swaths of humanity as not being worthy of common rights and freedoms.  All it requires is an obvious difference, combined with pervasive ignorance.  Just about any difference will do.  Skin color could make you a slave.  Having ovaries can relegate you to second-class status.  Being gay can have all sorts of serious repercussions, from insult to physical abuse, or worse.  <br/><br/>As pointless as these differences are, there are those who will apologize for the continuation of the abuse, as David Brooks did in his column, "Religious Liberty and Equality," 3/31/15.  Hold your horses, gay people.  The offense that religious bakers feel when gay couples request a wedding cake is supposed to trump the embarrassment, exclusion and shame that gay people feel when they dare to patronizing a public business.  Surely they can find another baker who will provide separate but equal service.  This is what passes for enlightened compassionate conservatism.<br/><br/>The sudden shift in popular sentiment about gays and lesbians seems to have come like a sigh of relief.  It takes a great deal of effort to hate people.  But TV shows and social media have shrunk the world, revealing gay people not to be abominations or curiosities, but our neighbors, our co-workers, our families and our friends.  It's hard to hate, or exclude or demean these people.  It's time that they were brought in from the cold.

332
I've met plenty of therapists I trust, but I've never read a mental health study I trust. The brain is such a complex place, we have almost no idea what works at creating whatever happiness may be. So if you tell me that 79% of Norweigians reported they felt "happier" after just ten minutes with an app, is that enough? Every study out there has methodological flaws, large data challenges, tweaked statistics and fad science. Not one of them is about me, rather just a fancy guess about what could work for me, maybe, if I'm close enough in istuation and brain type and age and socioeconomic status. Meanwhile, mental health professionals who establish trust and show some empathy and have a modicum of good questions to ask feel right and helpful to me. Does what I feel trump what science tells me to think? It sure does in the arena of my mental health. Put another way: if I'm in love and science tells me that I'm actually better suited for a different mate, do I care?

333
You know, we can save the county a bundle just by letting all Americans get sick and die. Eliminating CHIP will save money by increasing the death rate for children who are very expensive to feed, house and school. Whoever's left standing among adults can get semi-automatic guns and play spin-the-bottle with live ammo. <br/><br/>As the CBO declares, increased national illness "would create incentives for some people to work more," raising GDP by one-seventh of 1%. Yay! John Barrasso is right. That well proven one-seventh trumps decent human health and deficit reduction by a country furlong. <br/><br/>Anyway, deficit control is SOO-O-O GOP 2009!

334
In fact, the Fourteenth Amendment, as Judge Posner ably demonstrated in Baskin v. Bogan, does cover discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and the Fourteenth Amendment trumps the Ninth and Tenth.<br/><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/27/listen_to_judge_richard_posner_destroy_arguments_against_gay_marriage.html" title="http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/27/listen_to_judge_richard_posner_destroy_arguments_against_gay_marriage.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/27/listen_to_judge_richard_po...</a>

.<br/>     It is not news,  but, it is a beautiful example of how psychology can trump logic in economics.<br/><br/>    A big part of this particular phenomena is how the question is asked.<br/><br/>    Pollsters would get a different result if they ssid. something like: " Would you rather have X euros in your bank account or a different currency worth a  total if 2X euros. "  <br/><br/>Make the tradeoff part of the question and you might get more informed responses.<br/>.

00000000000000000000<br/><br/>Excellent. The maps illustrate it.  Whites are manipulated as they suffer from these anti social support ideas our politics uses to win votes. They’ve always been used to divide and conquer--19th C plantation owners or current financial elites, in symbiosis with the Gop. It’s worked well—the US has the distinction of the widest gap between the 1 pct and average earners in the 1st world. <br/><br/>The middle class, black and white, made progress over decades, but big money in our elections is undoing it, by nullifying political say of all but the wealthy. <br/><br/>States rights ideologies contradict US stated ideals, even as they’re extolled as proof of our freedom against big fed govt intrusion. This aids in the national schizophrenia. It’s ok to deny millions of people equal protection of the laws for medical care per where they live.  So US 1st class citizenship varies per  geography. The whims of local lords trump any federal law, even in life and death matters. <br/><br/>They said slavery expressed democracy as did segregation, ---the majority of whites wanted it.  Then the Court had to start bossing the states around to impose integration and affirmative action. <br/><br/>The gop used backlash well, and it’s still unfolding in horrible ways. The SC church massacre comes out of that.  Grievances of poor mistreated whites added to the most anarchic, profit seeking gun policy on earth. All works together.

337
Most commenters, as well as writers seem to have missed the most important point about the financial problems of Greece. Greece is a NATO member, and the new greek leader has been to Moscow twice recently. This is enough of an event, to indicate that Washington will spend the next few nights trying to convince European vassals to get a deal going with Greece. But Tsipras also got advice from Moscow, and will not give in easy. He has trump cards in his hands, contrary to popular belief. By going to Moscow, he has turned the table on his adversaries in Europe. I would have done the exact same thing.  He is widely seen now as Europe's Che Guevara.

338
I am so in agreement with you on being called "consumers."  It feels like capitalism has trumped democracy.  

339
Killifish<br/><br/>Thank you for your synopsis. CO2 is  indeed a greenhouse gas which is part of the "settled science." The question for a very long time has been: how much warming? and, how can we tell? Using the settled science, the answer is: not much warming and, so far, we haven't been able to tell from background noise (natural variation). The leap of faith has been that CO2 trumps ocean and atmospheric circulation amongst other things.  We have been mired in trying to prove people are to blame for climate control only the General Circulation Models have projected. Bad move. Unfortunately, Andy has not tweakedd his state position for a very long time which goes to my saying he needs to hang it up.<br/><br/>Now these are my views and you, others and Andy are welcome to prove me wrong. My memory can and has been faulty at times so please show me the way...to understanding and forgiveness.

340
Time for SC to acknowledge that the CSA lost the war and that the state has rejoined the United States of America.  Southern pride should not trump racial inclusion and national unity.  Moreover, the cowardly candidates for president are wrong about this being a state matter.  Racism is a national matter and they should show leadership if that want to lead the free world.

341
The article ends with a state senator saying, “I think each of the presidential candidates should stay away from what is clearly a South Carolina circumstance, they’re just going to invite criticism.”<br/><br/>Sorry.  Your state government's bigoted speech is what's inviting the criticism and in no way trumps an outsider's right to freely and deservedly criticize you.

342
SC started the Civil War, attacking the Federal base on Ft. Sumter, which is right out in the harbor in front of Charleston. Attachment to the flag by white Southerners comes from a sentimental feeling about their past and their ancestors,who fought and died in the war, which is understandable. I have (at least) two direct forebears who fought in the war, one of whom was wounded in it. To my mind, this kind of attachment to the past has to be trumped by the fact that the flag is the quintessential symbol of a society which thrived on slavery. To coyly pretend that the Rebel flag does not stand for a regime supported by slavery is intellectually dishonest, and there is *plenty* of contemporary evidence from the time to show that the "states' rights" argument is disingenuous, to put it mildly. Why don't these people hanker for whatever flag SC flew during the American Revolution, if it's tradition they're backing? The flag might be appropriate in Confederate cemeteries, but it was put up in the modern era as a rebuke to anti-segregation legislation, as a slap in the face to the black citizens of SC. It has to come down from the state house in SC, it just has to come down.<br/><br/>to come down from the SC state house, it just has to come down from there.

Contemporary economics is used to bolster the Elite and squash workers<br/><br/>Workers were told that Globalization was "good" for the economy<br/>only to see their jobs go overseas <br/><br/>they were told that Automation was "good" for the economy<br/>only to see their jobs replaced by robots<br/><br/>they were told that Overtime was "good"<br/>only to watch as more and more work was piled on, their salaries cut<br/><br/>During this time: their bosses got record bonuses.<br/><br/>Enough.<br/><br/>The Middle Class are the job creators, NOT the business owners and the affluent. We need to trumpet this again and again!<br/><br/>Middle Class consumption drives 70% of American GDP.  This consumption creates Demand.  The affluent and the businesses then fill this demand.<br/><br/>so you see, the MIDDLE CLASS are the job creators, and the affluent and businesses are simply Demand Fillers.  (nothing wrong with being a demand filler).<br/><br/>The problem:<br/>American Businesses and Politicians are destroying the middle class.<br/>Because of this, the Middle Class cannot buy things<br/>Their decreased purchases means less demand<br/>And less demand means that businesses/affluent have few to no investment opportunities, or opportunities to fill demand<br/><br/>THIS is why interest rates stay so low, and why businesses aren't hiring. <br/><br/>To fix the problem: we must increase the wages of the Middle Class<br/><br/>Decrease overtime. Hire more workers<br/>Increase wages<br/>Decrease outsourcing<br/>Decrease automation<br/><br/>Yes, short term it may be a hit to corporate profits, but our ECONOMY will do better.

344
Partially true, but you run the risk of being racist here insisting on black criminality. This is THE ISSUE everyone cares about really, more generally. But I do agree, nobody has given a proper route of action and neither is this article suited to alleviating that gap. <br/><br/>The words of oppression are words of revolution, this means it is somewhat at odds with the political system we have. Granted, fed judges can do this under the 14th Amendment or other Constitutional trumps, but the political process can as well. But it will not be easy, as your comment points out by its use of black criminality and police 'realities'.<br/><br/>Sadly, I fear adopting the words of oppression gets us into just starker narratives that will keep people out of the political process and demanding real political change (which is vastly more difficult to achieve). It reminds me of a professor that argued violent protests should be allowed because there are no 'perfect' victims. True, but when you realize we live in a more complex world where the status quo has actual reasons that shroud bias, the degrees do matter for justifying state action. <br/><br/>I stand with King.

345
10th trumped by 14th: Equal protection. <br/><br/>Look up Loving V, Virginia<br/><br/>That was easy. Next?

346
As much as I dislike the display and misrepresentation of the Confederate battle flag outside of a museum....<br/><br/>Flags can't kill people, but guns can, particularly those designed for that exclusive purpose, such as a 45 caliber Glock.  Take away the flag issue and this event bears similarities to massacres carried out by young males at Columbine HS, Virginia Tech, Aurora Colorado, the Amish school in Nickel Mines, PA, as well as Sandy Hook elementary school....to say nothing of the gun violence that plagues many inner-city neighborhoods in cities such as Baltimore and Washington.<br/><br/>Racist, crazy or cruel can't be controlled or sometimes fixed, but the means by which to surprise and kill a lot of people in a very short time span can.  Handguns and assault rifles serve no purposes beyond killing....people...quickly. <br/><br/>When did special interests trump law in this country?  This nation needs to grow a spine and do what's right.  Ban handguns.  Ban assault weapons.  Reimburse owners of such at fair market prices.  Restrict sporting and target arms to 3-5 shot magazines.  Register them all.  Jail and fine anybody who breaks a gun law.  Why is it I need 2-3 special permits to fish a trout stream (catch-and-release by law) but can purchase a Glock without restrictions at a local gun show?  And the only thing a Glock is good for is hunting people.

As much as I would like to believe these investment advisors look after the interests of the client first, my experience shows otherwise.  True, I know many in the industry whom I trust as individuals and friends (they are not my advisors), but they are all subject to performance targets and will do just about anything to meet those targets.  It is easy for them to rationalize that whatever they do to meet those targets is good and proper.   Unfortunately, that reality typically means doing what is best for the employees and the company and rarely what is best for the client.   Investment advisors are not hired to philosophize about morals but to make money for the employer and in turn for themselves.  If the client happens to make money as well, that is an ancillary result (which by the way the advisor will trumpet to the world as evidence of his great skill and interest in serving the client).

Kuperman is a rabid AIPACer and repeating his same set of lies about Iran as he loudly trumpeted about Iraq in order to have the US invade &amp; destroy it.<br/><br/>As Mearscheimer &amp; Walt point out in their acclaimed book the Israel Lobby , the Iraq War was accomplished by and for AIPAC. Eg. It was Wolfowitz who set up the Office Of Special Plans in the  Pentagon &amp; staffed it with Feith , Perle, Edelman , Wurmser &amp; 18 other AIPACers who generated the lies used to rev-up US public support to pre-emptively invade Iraq. (In previous gov`t security jobs both Feith &amp; Perle were charged with passing US secrets to Israel.)  Wolfowitz testified before Congress that the war would cost the US 1-2 $billion. Yes, Cheney wanted to bomb Iraq , but as he confessed to Sec of Treasury Paul O`Neil , his objective was “to demonstrate US hegemony in the region ”. <br/><br/>In 2003, journalist Thomas Friedman of the New York Times counted twenty-five members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations saying, “if you had exiled them to a desert island a year and half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened”.<br/><br/>Only Israel has benefited from the Iraq invasion. Ie It ended Iraq`s support for some measure of justice for the indigenous people of Palestine. Now these same people are pushing the US to do the same to Iran.<br/><br/>It is time to change the US election campaign funding laws so that a lobby can no longer game the system &amp; thereby control Congress against the interests of the nation.

I don't disagree with you on risk to possible hostages, but what was the Obama administration thinking when they ransomed Bergdahl? I guess political capital trumps good sense.

350
Mr. Brooks' column trumpeting the virtues-- if that is the word-- of harnessing and directing the lowest human impulses to the services of productivity and "progress" mistakenly conflates the capitalist's project with that of the Pope and brings to mind Christopher Hitchens' response to the writings of Ayn Rand:  "I don't think there's any need to have essays advocating selfishness.  I don't know what your impression has been, but some things require no reinforcement."

351
The only reason for this policy is to stop citizens from paying ransom, which should decrease the chances that terrorists take hostages. (No payment, no point in taking hostages.)<br/><br/>But if you would pay the ransom and go to jail -- and I'm certain I would too -- then the policy is not stopping citizens from paying ransom or decreasing the chances that terrorists take hostages. It only serves to punish families who are already in horrible circumstances. <br/><br/>That's why I'm leaning towards removal of this policy being meaningless.<br/><br/>No point in punishing people for paying hostage takers if punishing people for paying hostage takers isn't going to stop anyone from paying hostage takers.<br/><br/>There is no plus side to this policy.<br/><br/>I don't have facts or statistics to back this up, but I think love for family would trump logic for country every time.

352
I don't know about you all, but if a terrorist kidnapped my son or daughter and asked for $10,000 in exchange for their safe return, I would pay immediately. Wouldn't think twice. I'd pay even if it meant jail time.<br/><br/>The implication of my selfishness is that there is no upside in prosecuting people who pay hostage takers because I am going to pay them even if you prosecute me. If you agree with this logic, then this policy is all downside.<br/><br/>Love for my own trumps all, and I would be willing to sacrifice years of my life if it meant protecting my family, regardless of the negative externalities and unwanted incentives created by my actions. <br/><br/>I bet many feel the same way, but I don't know and have no facts or stats to back this up.

353
"the premise that we are, at our core, selfish individuals. "<br/><br/>Even if this is true, so what?<br/>"Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world <br/><br/>"Liberalism is founded on this same premise: individual rights trump the collective good."<br/>Classical liberalism, you mean, that appealing but contradictory melange of  enlightenment and Calvinism.

354
State's rights should never trump Human rights. The Confederate Flag should be retired. A new chapter in the South shall finally reign.

355
Even if Bernie Sanders wins the presidency and Republicans are booted out of Congress, now that TPP endows transnational corporations with a higher power, democratic government will be officially trumped by corporate rule. Mission accomplished. Class war lost. The oligarchy wins.

356
Andrew,<br/><br/>The only non-officials who were permitted access to the drafts and the drafting were industry lobbyists; indeed, the pharma- and entertainment-industry lobbyists reportedly wrote much of the intellectual property section of the agreement.  What the public knows about specific language it knows only as a result of a WikiLeaks leak.  <br/><br/>What is known in general terms is that disputes would be arbitrated.  It is characteristic of arbitration that arbitrators are not bound by case law precedent, so US law would have no force in the proceedings.  Indeed, since this is technically a treaty, it trumps all US federal and state laws; the alternative dispute resolution mechanism, moreover, takes it out of the US judicial system.  How can it be good for any American, worker or not, to have such a scheme in place?

357
In the totaling up of pros and cons and past grievances on the Cuba - US relationship, I rarely see lip service given to the corruption of the Batista regime (heavy US involvement), the US Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, multiple decades of gun-boat diplomacy by the US in the Caribbean, Teddy Roosevelt's trumped up escapades after the Maine was blown up.  It would help much to give a more balanced and historical review as to why relations evolved to be so bad.  Fidel and his version of Soviet supported communism have been economic and political failures, but have kept his country independent.

358
All due respect, I live in Detroit, and as far as I can tell, the killing this past weekend is huge news, just overshadowed by Charleston due to it's magnitude and historical significance.<br/><br/>I'd submit the black on black brutality is a result of internalized racism, everything from self-worthlessness, frustrated ideals and a real (and often true) belief that no matter what the effort, failure is inevitable.  My grandfather discouraged his only son from going to college with the old saying "you can take a horse to water, but you can't make him drink; you can send a boy to college, but you can't make him think".  There are miscreants of every race, but the pervasiveness of black frustration is overwhelming. <br/><br/>It says something that despite the overwhelming black on black crime statistics, fear of whites trumps that, at least for this black woman.

359
This would be comical, if it weren't so tragic.  <br/><br/>Question:  If the agreement is so great for our citizens and country, why is what is in the agreement such a big secret?  I suspect seeing the agreement as a whole may be even worse than the various parts that have been leaked, which, from what I have read and heard, give everything to corporations and nothing to our workers?  <br/><br/>Some people say this is not really a TRADE agreement but a CORPORATE HEGEMONY agreement that will be in effect for decades, no matter who is president or elected to represent the people in the House and Senate.<br/><br/>Why did Democratic President Obama push this TPP agreement, and why must it be secret?<br/><br/>Why did the 13 Democratic senators vote to fast track the secret agreement, when all indications are this agreement (1) elevates the power of corporations over governments; and (2) sells out American jobs and labor to cheap labor countries with few regulations--amongst other sell-outs.<br/><br/>Maybe the 13 senators did this out of party loyalty to President Obama, but 2 wrongs don't make a right.  Anyway, one of the reasons bureaucratic organizations are so messed up these days is because loyalty to the boss too often trumps quality and competence. <br/><br/>But thanks anyway to the Demcrats who stood tall and voted against fast tracking the global Terrible Plutocratic Plunder (TPP) agreement. 

360
It's a global economy and the U.S. needs to be a strong player in the global trade arena.  While the unions have their specific goals, the realities of the broader picture trumps their short-sighted views.  Ultimately, our global footing and strategies must be strong first to support the businesses, large and small, who employ American workers.  <br/><br/>Prosperity for everyone!

361
Iranians know the art of negotiating; Obama's team apparently doesn't. The US has signaled concessions on key points already, which of course encourages pressing further demands, not less (keep going till you hit the red line). Obama also publicly took the military option off the table which, whether he ever considered actually using it or not, was always his trump card. <br/><br/>Instead of conceding, the stance should have been: We will not only maintain sanctions, but increase them if you don't agree to our reasonable terms (full access for inspections is nonnegotiable -- as the French have reiterated), and if you still refuse, we will reexamine the military option along with intensified sanctions.<br/><br/>Let's see what the final agreement looks like. Obama seems eager to earn his Nobel prize legacy, but so far his accomplishments are more in the line of Chamberlain.

362
One: how can you eat poison "in a balanced way?"<br/><br/>Two: does someone's right to a specific job trump someone else's right to live?  <br/><br/>Three: how do you know companies will shut down? In my town, we banned trans-fats in restaurant food and though there was some carping initially. nobody went out of business.  Admittedly not exactly the same situation, but related.

363
Individualism and creative aspiration are not the scourge of economic oppression.  Supremacy is.  White supremacy was a national motto for centuries, that trumpeted compassion for poor whites and reproduction.  Even the Civil War was turned into helping poor white people who had been unable to compete in a slave dominated culture.  Let's not even start with the numbers of children born to mentally ill, or criminal parents.  How many children are born and delegated by society, to care for these mentally ill?<br/><br/>Whitewashing (pun intended) the grievous consequences of ego gone awry can't be limited to to individuality, capitalism, tyranny or genocide.  Rising up, must sidestep the image of a slandered salivating Pitt Bull and call society to a higher purpose.  This is mission that requires every once of individuality and creativity our collective spirits can muster. <br/><br/>The demon is trying to heal the world through punishment, boredom, limitations and prison.<br/><br/>Disclosure:  I have a slandered Pitt Bull rescue. He's really very sweet and well behaved.

364
"When did it all go sour? We fired the first shot when we expanded NATO toward the Russian border even though the Soviet Union had disappeared."<br/><br/>Maybe the cold war never ended, and Reagan is not the hero the right likes to trumpet.  If Reagan is to remain the cold war hero<br/>the right would have to argue that Russia fired the first shot when they illegally annexed Crimea; there is nothing illegal about expanding NATO.

365
The flag represented a view that state's rights trump the American Constitution, federal law, and human rights.  <br/><br/>Your argument that we don't 'take down Plato and Socrates' even though ancient Greece had slaves is asinine trope, especially as slavery did not rise to be a world concern until the eighteenth century.  It is a patently false argument.  One might as well argue that anything should be sanctioned because in geological terms humans are a relatively recent species.<br/><br/>Gone With The Wind and The Birth of A Nation are sentimentalist fiction and racist tripe.  No one is arguing for their eradication.  They are saying it's better not to impose symbols advocating their poison upon our national and state symbols because a psychopath here and there might mistake that for an endorsement advocating murder of African Americans.  <br/><br/>Your statement that the President 'casually' mentioned the ''N'' word is a complete lie.  He used the word purposefully and in a context devoted to discussing this painful subject.  <br/><br/>No one is proposing that Civil War sites be closed.  All that is rant and trollish hyperbole.

366
The cold war was the perfect war with its absurd stranglovian nature, and the threat to end mankind.  Yikes, it was great for the Military Industrial Complex until Reagan stopped it, or said he did with our massive spending on weapons.  We were great we could make consumer goods and pay for space and weapons.  Our system won.  They said, but then Yikes, no more spending, we needed something else, the peace dividend meant no more weapons necessary,  It did not take the first Bush long to figure this out with the first Iraq war, hurrah an enemy and more spending.  But yikes again, no big wars with Clinton, until the second Bush arrived and  trumped up a completely phoney baloney war and ta da, more spending on weapons.  But then again, they said we won.  Shucks less spending, until we came up with the perfect adversary, the one you do not know, who is everywhere but no where, the terrorist, and this guy is a child's nasty nightmare of beheadings.  Yikes again and more spending.  So this rattling in Russia, with out the fun, and this concern over China, it is only there to insure future spending, in case our drone warfare wears thin.  All to play  this idiotic game of nations.  A game that never accomplishes anything, but it makes some people very rich.

367
If these folks want to live in a country where religious laws trump civil laws, they can move to Iran. 

368
Now is a good time to re-visit separation of church and state.  The state is secular; it is not defined by religion.  Religion is confined to churches, or private worship in private homes.  The Middle East mixes religion and government and remains bogged down in constant religious wars.   The United States is not the Middle East; we are a secular nation.  Black churches in the South were places where voter registration took place in the '60's.  The history of black churches includes the flight to freedom of black slaves; the voices of Martin Luther King and other black leaders who marched for civil rights came out of black churches.  Black churches provided a refuge for freedom fighters and white supporters.  Now is not the time to defend racism and white supremacy in the South.  That battle was fought in 1860, and white supremacy lost.  The battle was re fought in the '60's.  Jim Crow is dead; racism is a relic of a terrible history; blood has been spilled over and over again.  Lindsey Graham's "heritage" appears to require more blood and sacrifice on the part of black citizens.  It is time for Graham to man up and drop his trumped up Southern "heritage".  It is a pathetic heritage, and it will no longer sustain the GOP.  Nixon's poker chip is now off the table. 

369
Is it not 'framing'?!   The poorest don't participate because their frame tells them there is no future in trying to work their way out of poverty.  The lower and middle classes are exposed to purposely divisive framing which correlates their personal welfare to notions and nostrums served up replete with scapegoats that pushmepullyou away from confronting a deteriorating income distribution and loss of opportunity at their source.   The Republican framing  --warnings against class warfare, socialized medicine, a social safety net for slackers not like us, tree huggers who take jobs, people of color, foreigners  and a tidal wave of gays, feminists and anti-gun rights advocates-- is doubtless comforting.   Framing trumps facts.  An easy story trumps facts.  Not having to wade through the tax code or climate statistics trumps facts.  Not having to know that parental wealth is the prime determinant of children's success is comforting.  Inertia and comfort with what one knows to be true deep down is the inalienable right that they must not be allowed to take away...     History will look back on all of this and see it as a Republican and 1% framing victory that successfully got people to vote against their own interests while thinking they were defending what is good and right.  The framing offers a lottery ticket.  Why do the poor gamble against such odds? Hope is also framed...

  For another look at how the Triangle (or in this instance, the Princeton Offense) can work, get ahold of a copy of the Princeton-Georgetown game in the first round of the 1989 NCAA Tournament, as shown in the ESPN Short:  The Billion Dollar Game.  <a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thebilliondollargame" title="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thebilliondollargame" target="_blank">http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thebilliondollargame</a><br/>  The complete game as well as the 1996 game where Princeton defeated defending champion UCLA are both available from ESPN films and Amazon.<br/>  In both games, teamwork trumps talent.

Yup.  Off any life-form that gets in the way of our greed.  Human needs<br/>must always trump the needs of any other life form.  Relocate the fish?<br/>To a landfill?  Who needs wild salmon?  We can grow them in New Jersey.

373
When does "traditional" religious bigotry and prejudice against our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters trump common sense, science, biology, and our love for our gay and lesbian neighbors, colleagues, and friends?<br/>When religion gives up tax exemption! Why should gay and lesbian citizen taxpayers subsidize bigotry and prejudice?<br/>Tolerance is giving others the same rights we claim for ourselves.

Two paragraphs, only a couple of sentences. But it says a lot. The highlight of it are the words “no comment necessary,” which happen to be the only three words that we can count as an opinion.<br/>I understand that Mr. Trump says what he says half-jokingly. We all know Oprah’s famous, influential, etc. But I feel like I need to point something out to him: why not run alongside Ellen DeGeneres? His chances of being elected would be even higher. America loves Ellen DeGeneres. America would elect Ellen DeGeneres as vice president. There are people out there trying to convince Mrs. DeGeneres to run for president. It's the magic of social media.<br/>Donald Trump is one of many Republicans who have announced that they are running for president in 2016. It’s ridiculous. Their large number is ridiculous. Many of the candidates can only be described as ridiculous. In everything I’ve read and everything I’ve seen, I didn’t once stumble across someone who managed to not make a joke about the ever-longer list of GOP candidates. We all laugh at them. But Mr. Trump? There’s just no way not to break down laughing. “I’d love to have Oprah. I think we’d win easily, actually,” he says. I believe either me or him have got the words ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ mixed up.

If the measure of a program's success is how well it persuades people to take other people's money, all leftist programs are roaring successes. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-beyond-the-handouts-1435080329" title="http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-beyond-the-handouts-1435080329" target="_blank">http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-beyond-the-handouts-1435080329</a><br/><br/>It's somewhat akin to trumpeting GM's success, bought at the expense of an $11 billion taxpayer hit. Give me half that, and I guarantee I'll be extremely successful.<br/><br/>Obamacare was a fraud sold with lies. But if bu "successful", you mean that it will, in fact, blow through the $2 trillion it's supposed to cost, I have every confidence it will more than meet your expectations.

Yes, words mean something. But, original intent (very clear in the ACA) trumps the parsing of words.

If it's there for the taking, he will take it. That has been his modus operandi and will continue to be so unless NATO forces are in place to confront him. As a de facto head of state for over 16 years, he epitomizes the slogan "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely". Grandiosity and paranoia inevitably become part of the package. Perhaps it would complicate the situation for him if we fostered a new front to contend with internally. You don't enter a boxing ring studying up on the Marquis of Queensbury rules if your opponent is entering the ring with a chain saw. Let's confiscate the assets of influential and super wealthy Russians instead of letting them enjoy the civil society protections here in the U.S. E.G. Prokhorov, owner of the NETS, Sharapova of tennis fame and Rybolovlev who bought the $88 M apartment for his college student daughter and then let's drag out the court proceedings for 10 years as Putin has done with trumped up charges against U.S. citizen Bill Browder. Revoke their visas and send these Russians home to celebrate the annexation of Crimea - or maybe decide they need to do something about the nut case that Putin has become.<br/>Simply put - turn-about is fair play.

In a society whose culture is ever increasingly grounded in the gratification of "objects of desire" it is hardly surprising that those who want the A.C.A. will ardently approve of the Court's decision. <br/><br/>But "outcome determination"  -- the process of making the law "say" what it needs to say to achieve a desired outcome -- has the unfortunate effect of destroying "the plain meaning of words."   This destruction, the Greek historian, Thucydides noted, accompanies all "revolutions."   <br/><br/>Scalia was right.  The Act uses the phrase "...established by the State"  at least seven times.   Those words do not mean "established by the State or by the Federal Government."    In what remains a federal system, the use or non-use  of the word "State" is not a stylistic choice; but has always had recognized and significant implications.  <br/><br/>In trumpetting a "non-tax tax" and now a "federal-state  State"  Justice Roberts has established himself as the High Paladin of Outcome Determination.   By the same token, the Supreme Court has reduced itself to a Queen of Hearts.   Farewell predictable English.<br/><br/>It is appropriate to end with the observation that the Act does NOT "provide all Americans with access to quality, affordable and often lifesaving HEALTH CARE."   The Act does not provide a system of PUBLIC health.   It provides for affordable health care INSURANCE.   The two do not mean the same thing as much as one might hope that they do. 

380
And had Mitt Rmoney been (s)elected in '12, and the economy were exactly the same as it is right now under Obama -- with the unemployment number already below what Mitt set as the target for the end of his SECOND term -- the corporate media (including the "liberal" NYT) would be trumpeting the "Morning in America" trope nonstop, telling us it was the "Romney Renaissance"...<br/>While Fox"News" and the Wall St Journal would be regaling us with the triumphalist good news of the "Mormon Miracle."<br/>And everyone reading this knows this to be true.

381
Roberts keeps federal largesse filling medical insurance company troughs.  Which soon will be bigger than the pentagon trough.  Maybe the med insurers' trough will trump filling the perpetual war trough.<br/><br/>A decision adverse to PPACA would have taken away the 14% take the insurance companies get off the federal subsidies........<br/><br/>Support single payer to keep the war profiteers in the green.

382
Re: the confederate flag, yes, and while it is allowed legitimacy in any state that incorporates it into their flag, it stands everywhere-not merely in those states-for the truly ominous and troubling cry of "The South shall rise again!", and all the horror that that implies.<br/><br/>As for the rest of these comments, some of which all too typically seek to repudiate what progress against racism that has been made since the Civil War, and which is, seemingly perpetually being attacked by the Right and its propaganda media arm - all too many are rife with Fox News inspired nonsense that misrepresents the facts, sometimes heinously, so that further comment here would not suffice to properly lay them out and rebuke them with the actual, real truth.<br/><br/>Those lies, which give false or trumped up justification to those already predisposed to retain their antebellum prejudices, are as noxious, in their way, as the confederate flag itself.

383
It's hypocritical, and a bit sad, that the justices in the minority, with Scalia in the forefront, relentlessly trumpet the "original intent" of the founders, but conveniently ignore the intent of the Congress that passed the ACA when it doesn't suit their ideological blinders.

384
It is interesting that Justice Thomas is normally Conservative BUT when an issue strikes close to home, he sides with the Liberals.<br/><br/>Guess blood trumps ideology.

385
NO one needs a gun.  The right of others to continue living trumps your desire to own a killing machine.  It's true that knives and hammers can kill.  However, these implements have other, legitimate purposes.  The only purpose of a gun is to kill, which is not legitimate.

386
JD they trumpet the "original intent" because the founders are dead!  They can't go ask them what they meant.  Congress is alive and they should have be forced to write legislation correctly.  This law twice now should have been struct down and sent back to to the congress to be fixed.  This is no different then the ponzi scheme Social Security Insurance.  Sold to the people as insurance, but actually a tax then FDR loaded court to get it passed for the good of the people. IN a few years when the baby boomers really start to suck the well dry and the checks stop coming what happens then?

387
Excuse me but why do non-poor countries get a pass on sterilization? <br/><br/>People can't do math...even 1 child per family inexorably increases population (unless one parent dies at each chidbirth). <br/><br/>Regardless, religious imperatives always trump hard reality. We are doomed.

388
The court is basically saying the intent of any law enacted by congress trumps any sloppy language lawmakers fail to correct or notice.

389
Sandman, how in the world can you come to the conclusion that people are paying more and getting less?  The overwhelming number of people affected by Obamacare have more health coverage, more economic security and are paying the same or LESS for healthcare than they were before.  The number of people paying more and getting less is ridiculously few -- so few that Republicans have been unable to find any to feature in their trumped-up Obamacare horror stories.

390
It is a wonderful day when common sense and humanity trump the anticipated political leanings of our heavily leveraged Supreme Court.  <br/><br/>Justice Scalia rants about SCOTUSCare but were Dante still alive, there would undoubtedly be a special circle of hell reserved for that petulant and pedantic justice, who would gut the intent of thousands upon thousands of pages of legislation based on a four-word Trojan horse ostensibly inserted by the bill's sponsors.  Scalia has reached the absolute nadir of legal reasoning if he really hopes to sell his highly politicized argument. 

391
Excellent news and very exciting, but with the caveat that in 29 states, being LGBT is still grounds for being fired from one's job and/or discriminated against in housing. While elated, I also expect a significant backlash from opponents. <br/><br/>The religious right saw this coming, which is why it already started trying to whittle away the benefits of legalized marriage by trumping up supposed threats to "religious freedom." <br/><br/>We may also see an uptick in hate crimes against LGBT people, so it's important that we be vigilant.

392
That this case was specious and trumped up should have been obvious to every first year law student. It was about a TYPO essentially.

393
Another exciting day when unelected federal judges and pollsters dictate social policy to the states and the electorate without a constitutional consensus or a rational basis in the Constitution.<br/><br/>Kennedy will go down in history with Blackmun as having created fodder for the ongoing festering of the cankerous necrosis that defines "progressive" America.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the various Rainbow this and thats and their consorts will continue their assault on the religious and family values of their fellow Americans while pretending that sexual preferences trump unemployment, declining production, trade imbalance, conflagration in the Middle East and the impending threats of Russia and China.<br/><br/>Somehow the U.S. has confused regressive with progressive.

394
With his latest dissent (his individual one, against gays marrying, and sneering at Justice Kennedy) Scalia has even trumped his dissent in the ACA case.  He has become, with Donald Trump, one of the two bookends on the Great Clowns Shelf.  

395
Would you wonder why the Court accepted a case that's affirmed 9-0, or 8-1? Probably not. It could be that one of the four justices -- I'd lay money on Chief Justice Roberts -- voted to take the case if only to say "Enough already, the ACA is the law of the land, and trumped up litigation won't change that!" Perhaps he's tired of the politicization of the courts, using them to get what you can't get in the legislature. I think his quoting from Scalia opinions supports this theory. It shows what has been clear for many years now. Scalia does not vote from textualism, or any other interpretive theory. He has a result, and will use and means necessary to get there. Even if it mean directly contradicting positions he took only a year ago. 

396
With all due respect, General Robert E. Lee murdered and ordered the murder of thousands of his fellow Americans to preserve the right of his confederates to own other human beings. Those acts trump all other deeds and words of General Lee.  Those are not the acts of a hero or a good man and a man who commits those acts does not deserve to be venerated in any way shape or form. 

397
Because marriage is oh, so much more than the negatives you quoted. No matter what anyone says (and I'm not a blushing 20 year old bride [athough who knows if they even existed after the 1800s]), partnership, company, friendship and love trump all. Just be happy for anyone who elects marriage. I'm very glad I did.

There is a consistent trend among conservatives to assert that constitutional rights should only be available to certain of our citizens.  The split in the court's decision should be seen as a clear sign of this bias towards their "people like us" attitude toward the Constitution.<br/><br/>This is not and has never been a states rights issue because one attribute of all states is that first and foremost, the US Constitution trumps all state laws and constitutions.<br/><br/>It is really a shame that citizens even have to fight for equal rights that should be considered by all, including conservatives, as applying to every citizen, not just some citizens.<br/><br/>We went through this with voting rights. It is still only in conservative run states that citizens are still fighting for their Constitutional right to vote because of voter suppression laws designed to favor right wing candidates.<br/><br/><a href="http://joethevoter.org" title="http://joethevoter.org" target="_blank">http://joethevoter.org</a><br/><br/>//

This SCOTUS decision is not about healthcare, it is about the sanctity of the written word.  The language in the law is crystal clear - only state exchanges get subsidies, yet the court ruled based on emotion.  Emotion being that the SOCTUS felt that the legislators intended to provide subsidies.<br/><br/>Feeling and intention are no substitute for truth and reality.<br/><br/>We are thick in the age of relativity and this is confirmed by the SCOTUS.  Truth and fact are now trumped by whatever we, or the politics of the day  "feel."<br/><br/>A country or society cannot be sustainable unless it is based on truth and reality.  In its simplest terms, destruction of our Country and society is was ideological liberals have done and are doing.

That may be, but the rights of today's citizens trump the feelings of long-dead founders (many of whom would also be appalled that women can vote and slavery has been abolished).

Ms. Gilbert, by her own admission, writes that she engaged in predatory behavior, broke up relationships and discarded her lovers once the heat of early infatuation had worn off. She also admits she treated human beings like objects in order to satiate a self centered need she didn't quite understand, Despite claiming she felt ashamed about doing things that even  "16-year-old kids" know are immoral and trumpeting her therapy and six months of celibacy, her mea culpa falls short. That's because there is no mea culpa. Despite the passage of time I don't think Ms. Gilbert has entirely escaped her self-destructive persona. Why do I think that? <br/><br/>Nowhere, not once in this article, does Ms. Gilbert say, "I'm sorry." <br/><br/>That is the hallmark of a narcissistic personality. Would it have killed Ms. Gilbert to take responsibility for the pain she has wrought? To say in print that that she was sorry to the individuals she hurt?  Instead the author uses this experience to trumpet her self-refelctive virtue and sell books.  I think Ms. Gilbert has gone from trying to seduce one person to trying to seduce all of us. <br/><br/>That man who went for Italian ices instead of you dodged a bullet.

First, since when are Christians in this country "live and let live people"?  Laws banning same-sex marriage, even same-sex relationships themselves, have always been motivated by Christian religious belief.  Laws banning interracial marriage were also "justified" using religious argument.   There has NEVER been a time in American history when religious Christians did not try to use the legislature (state and federal) to deny people the ability to live their lives as they saw fit.  Never.  Second, please don't turn yourself into a "victim" here by claiming that your beliefs have been "criminalized".  No one, and certainly not the Supreme Court, is saying that any religious body or individual clergyman will have to perform same-sex marriages.   This is about CIVIL marriage, about the benefits that accrue to married people under civil law.   No state can legally deny marriage to a same-sex couple even if every church within that state legally refuses to perform the wedding.  Do you understand that distinction?  Religious folk will have to understand that they cannot dictate to the rest of us what rights we have under the law.  No one is asking you to rewrite Christian theology, but the Court recognized today that your beliefs cannot trump our rights.  

404
We as a people seem to have extremely short memories. Trump is trumpeted as a rich billionaire. But is'nt he the rich man with multiple ( I forget how many - blame it on my short memory )bankruptcies to his name? How he weaseled out of all of them is still highly suspect. He is an obnoxious, preening, decadent, racist narcissist with extremely bad hair day, everyday. That Trump is polling second to Jeb Bush is a measure of our miserable selves. And these Republican Presidential Candidates who made the right noises after the massacre sat on the face to jump off as soon as the mourning period was over to revert back to their real racist selves. Really, a sad commentary on us.

405
it was a stupid remark on trump's part. perhaps he was thinking of the mariel boat lift from cuba when castro emptied his prisons of murderers and thieves.<br/><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears-castro-emptying-his-jails--into-florida-1386288.html" title="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears-castro-emptying-his-jails--into-florida-1386288.html" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears...</a>. still it does make for a screaming headline that the republican party is a refuge for racists. every politician makes regrettable statements.<br/>I know that liberals make sanctimonious statements with no action. they talk the talk but don't walk the walk. there are many public schools teachers, who are mostly liberal,  who send their children to private schools. they  and other liberals live in lily white building in manhattan which they own, worth 1M+ or are rent stabilized.  they speak out  in favor of low income housing but not where they live.  every time the city make it more difficult for builders to build it makes their apts. more valuable. anti poverty programs don't work but liberals who are mostly educated are in favor of them because it provides well paying jobs for them.  hypocrisy abounds.<br/><br/>trump has a record of getting the job done.  if you want secure borders he can achieve it. a few ill chosen words does not disqualify him. after years of failure in many areas e.g. chicago detriot , federal budget and the rise of  isis by main stream democrats and republicans trump deserves a chance to turn<br/>country around. 

406
What happened to separation of church and state has been a decades-long assault on it from the conservative Christian right in an attempt to codify their limited "church" beliefs as the law of the "state". You probably cheered the patently ridiculous Hobby Lobby "corporations have religions" ruling, which was one such decision blurring that line. Now that you see this ruling as line-blurring (which it isn't, see above comments) but in a direction you don't like, you are upset about the free-for-all in the courtroom. Your opinion embodies the entire rationale as why it isn't a good idea to let voters decide on discriminatory laws. The tyranny of the majority will invariably trump the rights of the minority in that case, which is what the court was constitutionally set up to prevent.

Horse hockey. Overwhelmed. How is it that immigrants and visitors that came to this country at the turn of the last century were absolutely scrutinized for everything from infectious diseases to origins. If they didn't pass muster the were sent back. They needed sponsors as well.  And to add the icing on the cake, enforcement officials were able to locate them in a moments notice<br/>from manual and very detailed records.<br/><br/>We are just LAZY today, and $$ trumps everything.

If anything the Warriors should have proven that a good team mix trumps superstars, even in a sport with only five players per team and a playing arena smaller than most major sports.  Picking a "team" is difficult.  Making them into a team, impossible - unless you luck out and find the right player(s).  The improvement in three-point shooters has rotated the emphasis from the dominant big guy more back to the expert play maker - though taller and bigger.

Where did you get the idea that the "NEW TESTEMENT (sic)" trumps the<br/>US Constitution in this matter?

This is great, I love it when the Republican party makes it perfectly clear that they stand for bigotry, hatred, oppression, discrimination, and such.  They trumpet that they vociferously oppose freedom, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, democracy, equal rights, and any such virtues.<br/><br/>They keep digging their own grave, hoping that radical bigotry will rise again, but the fact is, it's not rising.  The majority of the country approves of same-sex marriage, or simply doesn't care.  Most people think people should have as much freedom as possible without infringing on others' rights.<br/><br/>So Republicans prove more and more that they're the party of the past, that they hate everything America stands for, and that they should be rejected.  Now, we still do have a lot of extremely stupid people in this country, and that's where they're getting most of their support; that and the very rich who stand to profit from their destructive policies.  But that can't last forever, with increasing frequency the younger generation rejects the idiocy of the elder, and so I keep hoping the GOP goes extinct, to be replaced ideally by the Green party.  Really pretty soon people are going to realize the environment trumps all other causes, and those that don't realize this will perish.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you're going to write that Walker is pretending not to be a candidate, it's only fair to add that Jindal and Graham are pretending they are viable candidates.

Hey, when authors have a new book coming out, they trumpet the news.  Ms Gilbert is seducing us all here--buy me, buy me instead of love me, love me.  I do appreciate a (somewhat) honest glimpse of an ugly type, but I can't admire someone who plunders the love of others.  What's more precious than a committed love?  What's worse than someone who wrecks it on a whim?

I just returned from southern Europe. It was the EU that recently selected the trump suit, so we cannot blame Greece for over-trumping. I am referring to the repeated accusation that the new Greek government was grossly misleading and lying to their own people. This tactic has now blown up in their face. A weakened government and confused Greek public is thus forced to conduct a referendum to provide instructions.

Have you read the popes entire thing?<br/>I haven't but there are some parts I've seen quoted that may be of interest to you.  <br/><br/>Tell me would you take a creationist's opinion on global warming? No yet in his encyclical the pope declares evolution to be impossible to explain the complexity of humans.<br/>Now where have we heard that?<br/>Yet liberals trumpet "the pope agreed with us! Everyone listen to him" lol<br/><br/>Regarding the science of global warming, checkout<br/>@tan123<br/>@stevesgoddard<br/>And the third party charts they post and then ask yourself if there's truly no scientific basis to reject the Mann-made climate hysteria.

While the law as described is indeed worrisome in its implications, it's important to remember that there is a real problem that requires a dramatic shift in our sexual dynamics. Whether we like it or not, what happens between two people in the most intimate of situations is society's business: whether it's pregnancy, disease, or the various legal issues involving consent, we have to face up to the fact that concepts like privacy and personal choice are trumped by the butterfly effect: no action is truly private or personal. We also have to accept that a lot of what we might call "default" or "innocent" societal norms, like the freedom to touch another person without explicit consent, are actually rooted in assumptions that come from a position of privilege and power and a specific cultural context. Yes, it would be a tragic over-correction to brand someone as a sex offender because he engaged in behavior that both he and many women consider perfectly appropriate; but we also have to recognize that the status quo is not acceptable either. 

416
One can't wait to see what hilarious nonsense emanates from Republicans as they emerge from their clown car. One Presidential hopeful after another attempting to trump the Trump for shear audacity. I can hear them now:<br/>We God-fearing Christians are not gonna take this. Get rid of the Supreme Court, Repeal ObamaCareS, ban Marriage Equality, let States Rights decide to fly the Confederate flag. President Obama, who is a sleeper cell Muslim according to them, has demonized Christians. The Left is taking over this country. Is nothing sacred? For many of these Republicans, that will just be a start. Wait till they really get going.<br/><br/>As it grows each day, the GOP clown car carries with it the promise of every Republican Hopeful going full-bore and charging Hard Right to get the nomination. Each of them will be trying desperately to up the ante and clamoring to be heard above the Tea Party's crowded din of White Noise. Republicans are riled up and ready to explode, striking fear into their base, angry fearful old white men, by threatening them with a future of an America they won't recognize. <br/><br/>Open the doors to that clown car, GOP. We can't wait to hear what comes out of their mouths. It ought to be a real hoot.<br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan

You are pointing a finger at India's religious coercion while our country is in  the grip of fundamentalist Christians and Catholics forcing their will on the rest of us while receiving tax exempt status from the IRS. <br/><br/>Perhaps vegetarianism is a sincerely held belief by the officials in India. Of course they should recognize that all don't agree with them. The issue of possibly eating fertilized eggs is specious. If there are no roosters present then the eggs are not fertile and is no different from drinking milk. No animal is killed. Allowing sacred cows to starve to death would seem to be the greater sin.<br/><br/>There needs to be a compromise. If one has the choice of starving or eating a possibly forbidden food, one would think that eating would trump starving.

418
They are playing from the racist playbook of "massive resistence."  All the arguments are the same, including the nonsense that their freedom is abridged because others are now freer.  As for the county clerks lining up to cite their religious freedoms, they are free to resign their posts.  Their religious beliefs do not trump the beliefs of those who want to marry.  No one is forcing their bigoted churches to marry two same sex people; they are only being asked to keep their preferences out of their civic role.  They have no constitutional right to impose their religion on others.

419
Prior to the Civil War, some Christian churches uses a passage from Genesis 9:25-27 to justify slavery:  "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers. He also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem'."   They believed that the blacks were the descendants of  Canaanites who had migrated to Africa, making it just to enslave them.<br/>No one living in the United States today would ever consider that a person’s freedom of religion or right to live by their sincerely held religious beliefs should allow them to hold another in bondage.  I hope that perceptions about this issue will quickly come to be summed up as this:  no one’s religious beliefs can trump the rights of others to live a full, happy family life.  Further more, our commitment to a more fair and just society calls for us to ensure  that no matter who you love, we will guarantee to adults the full rights and legal protections that married status brings with it.

Economic calamity surrounding the increasingly fragile EU, with Greece the symbol of all that is dysfunctional, may not be anything new to news outlets or their readers around the world. However, what is new is the political chess game between Russia and the West that has resulted in elevating the Greek problem to a level of crisis we couldn't have imagined just a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>A Greek default and possible breakup of the common currency has been predicted and almost expected for quite a while. But, what we didn't expect, nor could we have anticipated, is the immediate threat a Greek exit from Europe would mean to the security of the United States and Europe thanks to a delusional government in Moscow led by Vladamir Putin.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the long run the inevitable breakup of the Union in it's current form must happen for Europe to free itself from the inequality and political strife the Euro has created. However, this assessment has drastically been altered by Moscow.  The new paradigm, or threat model, must now force even longtime proponents of a EU breakup to reconsider their sentiments on the grounds that national security, by far, now trumps economic viability and equality. At least in the short term. 

421
South Carolina will inevitably follow the example of Georgia and replace the Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia (the Confederate Battle Flag) with a political flag of the Confederacy.  Which, by the way, wasn't replaced in Georgia until several years after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics--just to provide some perspective on this supposed national outrage.<br/><br/>Why?  Because down South it is becoming apparent that white supremacists have taken the Battle Flag as a symbol and usurped its meaning, at least in contemporary pop culture.  But the political flags of the Confederacy are too obscure to have such "meaning" (although they obviously can be read to mean the same thing as the Battle Flag--this whole debate is a debate over who's meaning trumps I suppose).  

422
Pretty hypocritical scold, considering the way the US has treated the children from South American thug states whose desperate parents are sending them unaccompanied to the hope of safety here.  We could do more, (and add compassion and sensibility) but we can't absorb everyone.  The stable nations south of us need to share the load. They're curiously silent. Even the clergy isn't trumpeting, and they're usually the first to rail against injustice.  Those refugee children need help.  Where are the nation states who should be giving it to them?

423
Is there a parallel between the fiscal problems in Kansas and Greece? t appears that the decisions in government are politically driven in both places. Idaology is trying to trump economic reality and the state suffers, the population suffers. Taxes are the price of civilized government and tax cutting as a philosophy is a looser if you want a prosperous state.

As I was sleeping peacefully there suddenly was a blast from a trumpet or something like it, a sound I have never heard in all my days on this earth. then suddenly I was being lifted up, I watched as my world was falling below me. Higher and higher I was taken until our globe was just a small speck in the darkness surrounding me. Then just as suddenly I was brought down closer and closer still to this world of ours spinning below me. Now I could see a darkness over our world, for there were huge massive waves taller than any mountain washing over this world, they were even higher when they crashed into one another with a force so hard that the very sound of it would destroy. Then I realized what I was seeing, the very end of this world, this beautiful world and fear and shock almost over came me. Then the voice of the Lord the creator of this all asked me, IS THIS THE WAY IT IS TO BE, and I answered If It Is Thy Will O GOD.<br/>This will be the fate of this world, after all the centuries and years after the great flood, this will be the fate of this world, for I can promise all of you, that I have seen the Living GOD the very creator of every living thing on this world with my own eyes, and I have heard his voice with my own ears, I remember the night he made me one with the beloved woman I was created for and who was created for me, and this is what I know is that HE has done the same for all of you. No one is sent into this world gay.

I wouldn't count too much on millennial satisfaction with a status-quo of freelancing as either normative or fair.  Most would like to have a proper place in an organization--large or small--rather than having to fend for oneself in an uncertain marketplace.  Moreover  environmental responsibility is in not  in some kind of zero-sum battle with job development.  If anything a responsible movement toward a greener economy is likely to require a lot of entrepreneurship both organizationally as new kinds of enterprises emerge to supply the demand for solar and other low/no carbon alternatives.  Flexibility and fluency will trump narrow interpretations of what's going to valuable to younger generations as the economy evolves.  They will be steering change it not fighting it.

One of the arguments that the EPA made in this case was that humans require air to breath.  Profits trump human life.  Way to go SCOTUS!

Precisely who were the "we" who the author claims " ... made a commitment to help those in need of protection"?  These "we" certainly were not the common working and middle class rather well educated majorities in Europe.  Who would have recognized that it is mathematically impossible in a world in which 3/4's of the population live in corrupt authoritarian societies - for the other 1/4 to save or "protect" a nearly infinite flood of those needing "protection" decade after decade, perhaps for eternity.  No! Europe's elites, like America's 1% elites, greedy for the functional equivalent of a never ending supply of low-wage slaves created a fantasy of endless obligation, &amp; Europe's 1% nobilities signed it with a flourish in some gold and satin furnished ceremonies.  No common European ever gave informed consent to an infinity of obligation to take in not only the poverty stricken, but also countless millions who will contaminate their societies with vicious murderous hatreds, and nepotistic, and women and meritocracy hating  beliefs and customs.  What about the 1000's leaving Europe to join in the orgy of rape, pillage and mass murder crime spree in Syria does the author not understand?  It is high time that we establish a trumping moral obligation in the world.  Those who live in failed states have a moral obligation to stay home and advocate, fight and yes die for a better life as opposed to running like cowards to 'the west' or to 'the north' in order to "make more money".

428
You raise a false dichotomy.  It is not either we allow electric power companies to pollute the air, or people will die in the summer and winter because electric rates are too high.<br/><br/>Making sure the air we breathe is not polluted should be done no matter what this costs the power industry.  We all suffer from pollution.  Regulating the power industry must be done no matter what this does to their cost of doing business.<br/><br/>Breathing unpolluted air is a justice issue.  Lowering the cost of generating electricity is an economic issue.  Doesn't justice trump economics?

429
The problem is marked by our inability to admit that people need help to transition from one level of civilization to another.<br/><br/>Subsistence level societies are driven by opportunism, 'alpha male'ism', and mistrust of competing humans.    More "highly civilized" societies have learned to sublimate opportunism, encapsulate 'alpha male'ism', and expand trust as a means to foster both progress and prosperity (not completely, but just enough to allow "others" to have at least a chance to prove themselves trustworthy........conservatives would 'roll back' that progress, but I think that its here to stay.).<br/><br/>The problem is compounded currently because there is a distinct possibility that we have 'too many humans' on the planet (that is, more than we can productively employ given current and emerging technology).    <br/><br/>Don't tell the capitalists, but it is realistically possible that we may need to divert some of the profits that will be delivered by the emergence of robots and artificial intelligence.   Divert, that is, from the few in order to repurpose humans for more civilized pursuits that are in the interests of humanity rather then in the interest of collecting 'overblown' tokens of personal achievement.<br/><br/>It's not as scary as it sounds, because all of morality is based on the idea that the pursuit of human values trumps mammon (aka profits).     Let the games of the reality show that determines the 'best human' begin!

When I was taking a college course back in the late 80s, the professor asked us to write opinion pieces for publication in "a European newspaper" arguing either for or against the introduction of a common currency before the introduction of a common government.  I argued that the expert on monetary, customs, and postal unions was Otto von Bismarck, and that Bismarck would have counselled strongly against the establishment of the Euro.  It is not possible to get people to agree on taxation and fiscal policy unless they feel they are part of the whole; and, assuredly, Greeks feel they are Greek, Poles are Poles, Spaniards are Spanish.  They are who they always were, and as an afterthought, they are European.  The Austro-Hungarian Empire had a common currency, but it never functioned as a democracy; as soon as people were given a choice, they ran away and created linguistic unions. <br/><br/>Greece, the country that gave us the very idea of democracy, is showing us how language and culture trump idealistic notions of a common currency, even when pursued in the noble cause of a European Union.

As usual....money trumps all in this country.  Good health be damned.  

432
"Industry groups...challenged the E.P.A.’s decision...saying the agency had failed to take into account the punishing costs its rule would impose."<br/><br/>Industry was obviously concerned regarding the "punishing (FINANCIAL) costs" not the "punishing (HUMAN) costs," and the majority conservative justices on the Court assured us that money concerns trumps human concerns. 

433
This a bad decision because it sets s precedent that politics trump  reason and fairness.<br/>It does not stand to reason a landlord will keep his building in good condition if he can't make a fair profit and fairness to expect him to.<br/>If it is fair to control what he charges because of the economy and not what other people charge for what they provide for things the poor need.<br/>It stands to reason that the price of oil will go up and the cost savings this action is based on will disappear.<br/>It stands to reason that the mayor will increase  real estate taxes and water taxes to pay for the programs  he  has planned but there is no money in the budget to pay for..<br/>Politics now favor the poor over the rest of the population but  will not always be that way.<br/>Once you set a precedent that politics can decide the size of the rent increase allowed  then;politics will be used to increase this amount or even get rid of rent control  completely.

434
Over the decades America has strewn weapons of all descriptions across the planet and a not insignificant number of them fall into the hands of folks like ISIS, Boko Haram, and long list of lesser known purveyors of population control.  Of course, the US hasn't intended these "tools" to end up where they did but, still, they knew this would happen and acted anyway.  And that was just our government at work.  Collateral damage can't be helped, you know, when working toward the greater good.<br/><br/>So now comes the Chamber of Commerce, a quasi-governmental entity, contributing to the efforts of the US in any way it can.  Tobacco is not as quick as a bullet, but just as effective in the long term.  And it is only the tip of the spear.  The CoC also shills for mining and chemical industry pollution around the planet, trumpeting the financial benefits (to industry owners) of air and water that qualify as toxins.  Again, collateral damage is unavoidable.  So sorry.<br/><br/>Did I mention the Chamber of Commerce does this with tax exempt funds?  That the tobacco, and chemical and mining companies get a tax deduction for the money they contribute to the CoC?<br/><br/>And all this for the greater good, of course.

435
The true cultural schism.  We humans for some hundreds of thousands of years have been curious, sexual, innovative, and socially familial.  Our biological drive to procreate and rear a family has not changed over these thousands of years.  What has also been present among us are those who find power in manipulating our above-mentioned traits in order to weave a narrative to gain power.  Organized religion, by explaining the reason for the cosmos (our reason for being here), and what happens after death, wields a powerful tool in this power-gaining narrative that for thousands of years has been utilized by all religions that have come and gone.  As long as mankind believes the power narrative, that mysticism holds the answers to life and death, mankind will be manipulated by those who claim to have these answers.  Once mankind begins to distrust the narrative, and the reality of science trumps religious mysticism, mysticism's enthralling power will wane and mankind will remain as we once began; curious, sexual, industrious, and socially familial.

436
More of that Progressive Settled Science at work. Governments need to actively intervene in the economy, redistribute wealth aggressively and 'stimulate' the process by borrowing or creating mountains of money while the elites mouth the platitudes of compassion. It will all work out to prosperity in the end. Adam Smith? Economic 'laws'? Pshaw! Every leftist economics professor worth his overstuffed lifetime salary knows that what matters is Fairness and that economic reality is cruel and unjust. And what member of the Noble Electorate is going to turn their backs on subsidizing everyone? So you want to toss Granny over the cliff and starve children? You heartless Right-Wing knucklehead. But Reality does trump Settled Science, as we see in Greece. Granny will get tossed, children will go hungry and it won't be Evil Capitalists doing it, it will be Caring Progressives and their ignorant ideology. Greece is only the first tiny domino; this disaster will happen here sooner or later. Probably sooner. The bubble is about to burst.

437
The debt in Greece is a phony one trumped up by the IMF to keep selling arms to the Greeks.

Anybody ever tell this guy the expression "A day late and a dollar short". Pre Bridge Gate maybe he had a chance at being the bully who pushed his way to the White House. Post Bridge Gate he has the gall to represent himself as the speaker of the truth? A guy who doesn't even know what the people down the hall in his office are doing want us to believe he can even find the truth? His popularity in his state is in the cellar his cronies are indicted I guess he says what have he got to lose now? His timing is terrible because they already have a guy with a big mouth in the race. Donald Trump has already trumped him for that position. When you down on the score card they all think the best play is to beat up on Obama. Would love to be a fly on the wall when Christie sees The Donald on the debate stage while he is stuck in traffic on the George Washington Bridge.

440
Agree with Andy. Nielsen's #'s are suspect. The total amount of time across all activities is 861 min. or 14 hours and 20 min with TV being 7 hours and 45 min. Their subject groups must all not be working or are zombies and don't sleep. I think digital will be proven to trump TV for the election season in both $$$ spent and effectiveness after everything is said and done.

441
It does seem fitting karma that the pontificator, the Donald, who trumpets 'you're fired' has himself been fired by NBC, losing his hold on Celebrity Apprentice and the Miss USA pageants.<br/><br/>What can one say about someone who is so addled that he can't comprehend the outrageousness of his comments, or the subsequent outrage or the possible ruination of his little kingdom.  <br/><br/>After his bout is done with Trump, Inc., he seems a fine candidate for becoming a side show barker.

I don't see how the Times can square Court behaviors like this article with trumpeting a left leaning Court. It's not left leaning. It barely grazes the reasonable center, and at times has sliced off into craziness. The EPA cannot regulate coal plant emissions? The Lobby of Hobbies gets to decide what birth control their employees may purchase? Abortion providers must have full hospital facilities? Stop dimming expectations; that is not your journalistic job. Honestly, your editors can sometimes have the fairness of reporters, but your reporters more often have the skew of editorial righters, and I mean righters.

I've been in Greece for a few weeks. Athens now. ATMs are not being mobbed so far as I can see. I've seen some minor lines, but not to the degree that is being hyperbolically reported. The cafés in tourist and nontourist neighborhoods are packed as usual. The Nes-frape everywhere. The demonstrations in Syntagma Square have been mellow. The Greeks I've spoken with express more confusion than conviction. Austerity has been a total failure. The EU accepted Greece, and didn't look under the hood. They didn't notice the GoldmanSacks fingerprints on the books. ... or did they, and looked there other way?  The lenders made bad loans. Is the EU the United States of Europe or not? The US wouldn't let West Virginia go bankrupt and allow vulture-banks eat the carcass.<br/>Man up Germany! You can't quit once it gets hard. The union should trump the lenders.

SUPERVISION  What I believe makes the difference between effective training and a scattered, disorderly training experience in many fields including medical, educational and other practitioners, is supervision.  I think it's far better to place interns with physician assistants or nurse practitioners so that they can observe how experienced professionals interpret the presenting complaints of patients who arrive at the ERs.  With oversight from PAs and NPs, the interns will experience more professional growth than by working alone using a trial and error method.  The story about the intern who refused to take an acute stroke patient for imaging is chilling, as it is an example of a life-threatening flaw in service delivery.  Patient safety must trump the end of a shift.  The first principle of the Hippocratic Oath is, First do no harm.  Abandoning a patient having an acute stroke, except in the hands of someone prepared to intervene immediately, looks like reckless endangerment.  PAs and NPs can also help interns by modeling how rapport and trust are established during the initial contact with a patient.  Increased use of PAs and NPs is the way of the future, so interns are lucky to be able to benefit from support while working with and being supervised by them.

"Mexicans Bash Trump Pinata, Call Him Imbecile"<br/><br/>I found Donald Trump's recent comments very interesting and mesmerized by his bold attitude in announcing that he's running for President in 2016. His comments about Mexico come off as very hurtful and racist. His almost bragging about his immense wealth come off as intimidating to the American people. I think Trump really deeply hurt his chances he had of becoming a top candidate for President. His continued disapproval by his peers paints him as public enemy number one. However, as others may disagree, I think Trump's candidacy is unique from so many of The United States past elections.<br/><br/>I understand how Trump's comments are profound and uncalled for. The people of Mexico should be deeply offended. However, Donald Trump could still become a strong candidate for President. If he decides to backtrack from his remarks, he still has the unique ability to become a strong candidate. To me, Trump wants change in America and he will push forward. I feel like he urges for more impact unlike former candidates. He distinguishes himself from the rest of the pack. That's about the only thing I like about him.<br/><br/>I still think Trump is a bad candidate. I don't think his future comments will help his candidacy. His comments will always be harsh and nasty, and his comments will never comfort the American people. But he's different. Lets just remember that.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/06/26/us/politics/26reuters-trump-mexico.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/06/26/us/politics/26reuters-trump-mexico.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/06/26/us/politics/26reuters-trump-me...</a>

According to the Newark (NJ) Star-Ledger, the largest newspaper in the state, Christie tells it in accordance to his own political experienced.  Who could ever expect to vote for Chris Christie…for any office, let alone the highest one in the land.  He only trumps Donald What'shisname.<br/><br/>Wouldn't that make an exciting GOIP Presidential Ticket in 2016?  Christie and Trump…now Trump and Christie.  I wanna be on top!  No, I wanna be on top!  Curlie, Larry and Moe uber ales.

Some may look at this public release of frustration as foolish or courageous or both, but either way it has opened up a critical release valve to begin ventilating the paralysis of ugly big money politics that has hurt the citizens of our state and city communiites.    While people struggle to survive in a very precarious economy, corporate and the real estate lobby, who have an iron grip on media and therefore public opinion, prepare for their next salvo.   <br/><br/>In the end the politicians are manipulated by the puppet masters and they are most likely amused at this latest drama; however, they will determine how it can be spun agaisnt a mayor who has attempted to shake things up; albeit with lack of political skill.   It's amazing how certain "reporters" working for CBS local  TV news consistently generate ngegative angles when reporting on issues connected to Mayor DeBlasio.  It's as if they are planted their just to negatively highlight any action Deblasio takes.   Just an observation that should remind us that big money and power is in control and will ensure that corprate interests trump quality of life and improved economic security and prosperity for the majority of New York's inhabitants. Not just for those at the top of the socio-economic pyramid.   <br/><br/> It looks like the gloves are off, and the mayor can only make it to round 15 if he's willing to show he's got the guts to fight this public spectacle with out fear of losing or even dying in this political arena.   {??}

What a crock!<br/>TPP with corporate lobbyists spending $5 billion a year subverts democracy and broadens inequality.<br/>Yesterdays NYT headlined the US Chamber of Commerce as trumpeting Lung Cancer and subverting global anti-smoking measures.<br/>Google would love to expand HB-1 Visas permanently. It's easier than creating massive training and education programs for American workers.<br/><br/>The Democrats,some Republicans and the corporations have no trouble  expanding rights for woman, LGBT and African American and other sectors of the population. The writing is on the wall of liberty and freedom. Marketing surveys have declared that Cultural Liberalism is here to stay. That's a good thing.<br/><br/>What the political parties as well as the corporations  don't want to do is grant citizens' rights or workers' rights.<br/>The TPP will massively intrude on national environmental, labor and financial laws and regs. The flight of manufacturing jobs will go to the Global East. Educating minorities and the poor becomes a thing of the past as the Obama/Bush administrations encourage privatization of schools and the degradation of the public school system.<br/><br/>The Walton Family have more wealth than the bottom 180 million Americans. There is something wrong with our system.<br/>There are more part-time jobs since 2008 than ever. Pensions are gone - unless you work for the NYT as Bruni does.<br/>This is no time to celebrate corporate power which since CitizensUnited has expanded its power in corrupting our republic.

I'm still amazed at some of the GOP candidates' courage for running, in spite of all the corruption (discovered or yet to be discovered), gaffes, policy blunders, regressive stances on important issues, lack of ideas, and an overall disconnect from a changing demographic US population.  Jindal, christie, trump, and my favorite bible toter, huckabee....what are they thinking?

ZERO SUM GAME  Iran's religious leader Khamenei, has acted as has been predicted, trumping any secular agreements by claiming that as the relgious leader he makes the final decision about anything and everything.  And so he does.  Such a leader who does not value human life and believes that it is in the next world is all that matters.  Any suffering it causes his people are part of their religious observance.  Eradicating the world with an Iranian nuclear bomb is acceptable because he says it is part of the divine scheme of things.  Is there any doubt that dealing with an authoritarian extremist is not going to end up as a good deal.  Still, I think that the 5 nations' unwillingness to bargain publicly is much to their credit.  If the Supreme Leader loses face, we all come out losers.  I think that he really believes that he can act as if he can do as he pleases and the sanctions will go away.  They will not.  There will be no agreement to lift sanctions as a gesture of good will, but rather adherence to the protocols to provide transparency and access to Iran's nuclear industry.   So let him make his proclamations publicly in Farsi, while the real deal will be made off camera in English.  I believe that Obama is not going to budge about removing sanctions until the inspection team has completed its first round of intrusive review of all sites deemed necessary.  We have to make a show of a bad good deal in Farsi and acknowledge the real deal in the English version.

452
People like Friedman are covering for the left-wing agenda.  Obama doesn't care about the leverage he has, he is motivated by a transformation of Mideast policy and US security architecture.  Blaming America for the world's ills, he puts America in a weaker position by abandoning our friends, and strengthening our historic enemy in the region - Iran - who has the blood of American soldiers on their hands.  That is the ideology of this President - a weaker, Western Europeanized America, where social justice and domestic upheaval trumps maintaining global balance and order.  Time to pay for all of our success, usually on the backs of the brown peoples of the world, and that means cutting a deal with the criminal theocrats in Tehran.

"Corporate America, once notoriously averse to engagement on controversial issues, has now joined with the apostates."<br/><br/>Corporate America is still averse to engagement on controversial issues.<br/><br/>That Corporate America is no longer fighting, in fact is identifying itself, as amenable to same-sex marriage, is an indication that same-sex marriage is indeed no longer controversial with demographics of importance to Corporate America - those that determine its present and future profitability.<br/><br/>What is controversial now are forces fighting greater social equality and comity in the name of "purity." Corporate America is not leading. As usual, they are just following the money. And in this case, that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Eventually, the "purity" crowd will itself shrink as many of the holdouts respond to the same incentives Corporate America responds to.<br/><br/>We're Americans, darn it. And in the end, for most of us, profit-cy trumps prophecy.

Mr. Downes, are you jealous? Are you one of those guys who says, "It wouldn't be worth it to have 9 billion dollars, if you had to Donald Trump's personality along with it?" <br/><br/>Just put your petty jealousies aside for a moment, and think how cool it would be to have Donald Trump for president!<br/><br/><a href="http://cultureworld21c.blogspot.com/2015/06/donald-trump-for-president.html" title="http://cultureworld21c.blogspot.com/2015/06/donald-trump-for-president.html" target="_blank">http://cultureworld21c.blogspot.com/2015/06/donald-trump-for-president.html</a>

Trump is a joke, and anyone who writes about him as if he's a serious candidate with goals of helping, politically, to solve societal problems just doesn't "get it."<br/><br/>For many years, commerce overlapped into politics.  Then, commerce began exercising strict control over our entertainment and leisure.  Now, we are seeing a pervasive commingling of all three, with Trump being the advance guard of an entertainment-business-governance triumvirate [One might say that California gave us Ronnie and Arnold as advance agents of this change, but they both made some effort (however weak) to convert themselves into "serious politicians," while Trump has no interest whatsoever in doing that.]<br/><br/>Our attention spans have gotten so short, and our dislike for complexity and intellectualism so deep, that we are left with "Trump."  Whimsically, even his Dickensian name works, as if we now accept that good government can be "trumped" by soundbites and emotional outbursts.  By our own slovenly ways of thinking and unwillingness to apply complex reasoning/analysis to complex problems, we have driven ourselves toward this political state of affairs.

458
All Trump does is trump up conflicts to get attention.  As untalented, unlikable, and having failed as many times as he has (especially in relation to his successful father), evidently he can't figure out what else to do.  Negative attention is more preferable to him than no attention. <br/><br/>Trump's worst punishment would be not to receive any media attention.  He is the original class clown; only he is just mean and not really funny.<br/><br/>Trump doesn't need the presidency; he needs therapy

459
My thought, also, as I read this, thinking that Krugman could have written it if he weren't out bicycling in some "undisclosed location." Then I remembered that Norman Ornstein of AEI co-authored "It's Even Worse Than It Looks", the 2012 book (with Thomas Mann of Brookings) that placed the blame for our dysfunctional politics squarely on the GOP's movement to the right wing fringe, where facts are always trumped by ideology.<br/><br/>One's heart has to go out to those few conservatives with intellectual integrity. How lonely they must be.

More hooey from the NY Post, which will stoop to anything to put down "liberals" and "liberal" organizations.   Anyone can plainly see that the "X" is decorative - multi-colored, no stars - and different than the Confederate flag.   Is  EVERY "X" with red &amp; blue a racist symbol?    Ochs' mother may have had racist views, but his father &amp; he clearly didn't - Julius was even a Union solider.   Ignore the NY Pest, a so-called "news" paper that's already endorsed Donald Trump (talk about a racist....).<br/><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/06/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-message-republicans-need/" title="http://nypost.com/2015/06/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-message-republicans-need/" target="_blank">http://nypost.com/2015/06/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-message-republicans...</a>

Clearly, profits trump everything else in the minds of those on the Chamber. For shame!

464
It's hard to believe that Mr. Bruni reads the news and business pages of the paper that employs him. Good for those businesses that support worthwhile social change. But it's hard to ignore the contradictions those good deeds attempt to paper over (though Mr. Bruni gives it his best shot). Corporations routinely give CEOs multimillion dollar retirement packages, while balking at the costs of small increases to our shamefully low minimum wage. They trumpet their environmental concern, yet pay lobbyist millions to fight basic regulatory oversight. They increase profits by cutting corners on workplace safety, and attempt to evade responsibility when the inevitable disaster occurs. The list goes on. And the brand-burnish can't really disguise the social damage that results from income inequality and the host of other economic slights and humiliations we deal with every day. That guy who equates "voters" with "customers" demonstrates a mindset that's sadly characteristic of this current gilded age. We used to be thought of as voters and citizens; but now we're "customers", a target audience for PR and marketing initiatives.

465
True, but shouldn't a big part of this "conversation" focus on ways to alleviate historical effects?  The current "conversation" is simply a political tool and one used by the media (NYT especially) to sell more advertising.  Further, the "conversation"--i.e. simply finding any conceivable way to find and exaggerate white racism--is increasingly divisive and only adding to the problem.  <br/><br/>If you put a low-income white family with two kids alongside a low-income black family with two kids in a typical urban or suburban neighborhood, all else equal, the chances of success is no better for the two white kids.  i.e. it's much more about socio-economic status (and maybe a little bit about cultural values) than it is about racism as it exists today.  Does racism exist? Yes. Are there more socio-economically disadvantaged blacks than whites because of past racism?  Definitely.  But pragmatism should trump emotion, and maybe the only way to remedy the socio-economic effects of past racism is to focus less on race and more on ways to better the situation for all low-income households, regardless of race.  

466
Your comment is unnecessarily hostile and biased, as well as uninformed. Nicholas Winton was raised as a Christian by a family that converted. He attended Stowe School, which was founded to instill "confidence and respect based on Christian values."  And according to Matthew 6, Jesus preached: "Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men."<br/>I think we can all agree that charity, kindness and humility are shared values that we should all celebrate, especially in the obituary of a man as good as Nicholas Winton.

467
Took a break from my routine and dropped in here to salute Nicholas Winton. It is the deeds of the quiet unsung heroes that do things because they are the right things to do and don't blow their own trumpets after they are done that this planet needs more of. It is their great humility that make them not want the lime-light and are perfectly happy with smiling at themselves or shedding a tear as they live out their lives. Let us recognize that the list of unsung heroes is too great for any man or computer to enumerate not only by their most assuredly great numbers but also by the virtue of their quiet nature which cloaked these 'giants' in the sea of humanity. <br/><br/>God blessed this man with a long life. He now takes his place in glory in what must be a special place with all the other unsung heroes who god has called home.

468
From the perspective of a reader of the NY Times, it's hard to see anything other than that a "no" means drachma and "yes" means euro.<br/><br/>From the perspective of human nature, it's also impossible to see anything other than that "no" means us (i.e., drachma) and "yes" means them (i.e., euro).<br/><br/>Given how tribal instincts (i.e., us/drachma) oftentimes trump kowtowing to the other (i.e., them/euro) or even reason and one's own best interests, I'd probably bet on the "no" vote winning.<br/><br/>But, of course, fear is the most powerful of all instinct.  So if the Greeks believe that 'big-daddy' (i.e., Germany et al) may yet still ride to the rescue by forgiving them their profligacy or at east making it less painful than returning to a sure-to-be virtually worthless drachma, then who knows.  

469
Everyone seems to be forgetting that Tsipras does have one trump card to play: Putin.  <br/><br/>Tsipras was a member of the Communist Youth of Greece in the 1980's. The Communists were a major factor in Greece, both as part of the resistance against the Nazis,  and in the Greek Civil War that took place after the Nazis were expelled in 1944.<br/><br/>The Communist Party in Greece, the KKE, is a real party with 15 seats in the Greek Parliament.  Given Putin's desire to rebuild Russian influence, Greece does have somewhere else to turn to, as opposed to letting the Germans, once again, take over their country and make them into slaves.<br/><br/>Of course, you could say that Putin is now a capitalist, and would have nothing to do with all of this - but I would not want to bet on that.  Putin's brand of "capitalism" starts with a capital "P", as in Putin.  Let's not forget that ones past performance in taking over other countries, is an indication of ones future performance in taking over other countries.<br/><br/>Reactivating the Greek Civil war is what the referendum on the 5th is really about. Unlike the United States, in Greece, the term "leftist" has real meaning - it's not just a slur used in political campaigns.<br/><br/>Expect anything.

“Germany is essentially the hegemon in Europe, but it does not like being seen as running the show,” said Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London."<br/>You know why? – Because whenever Germany is a little bit more forthright on an issue, everyone in Europe (particularly the UK) and the USA then trumpets: "Oh no – here we go again, Germany is throwing its weight around" When Germany is  a consultative team player they still get criticized. This is all bit rich coming from the USA where the states cannot agree on the most basic issues.

471
&gt;&gt;&gt; Everyone seems to be forgetting that Tsipras does have one trump card to play: Putin.<br/><br/>Serious European analysts know it's not much of a trump card. Putin doesn't want anything to do with Greece, as he's in way over his head on two issues that are much more important to him: Russia's own economy and Ukraine.

@Jim: "The fact is that what he said is actually more factual than Mr. Downes' twist on the subject."<br/><br/>The Times posted a transcript online.[1] Mr. Trump asserted that "Mexico sends its people". That is ambiguous at best and gibberish at worst. He also asserted that "[they] have lots of problems", by which he appears to mean that "they" use drugs, commit crimes, or are rapists. He did not cite any reliable sources with statistics to support his vague claims. In particular, he did not say what he means by "lots".<br/><br/>If Mr. Trump cannot express himself more clearly than he did, he should not be president.<br/><br/>[1] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/16/choice-words-from-donald-trump-presidential-candidate/" title="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/16/choice-words-from-donald-trump-presidential-candidate/" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/16/choice-words-from...</a>

His first and third wives are immigrants[1], but he is not a hypocrite, if that is what you are trying to say. Although he expressed himself very badly, he appears to object to immigrants who have "problems"[2], by which he seems to mean those who are drug users, criminals, or rapists. What he means by "people that have lots of problems" is still vague, because he does not explain what he means by "lots". You can charge him with ambiguity, vagueness, and incoherence, but not with hypocrisy.<br/><br/>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Personal_life" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Personal_life" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Personal_life</a><br/>[2] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/16/choice-words-from-donald-trump-presidential-candidate/" title="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/16/choice-words-from-donald-trump-presidential-candidate/" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/16/choice-words-from...</a>

Trump is a centipede with an almost endless supply of feet he can and will (before this is through) shoot himself in.  He not only thinks and speaks in stereotypes, he is a stereotype.  Plus he had a rich daddy who was already a real estate mogul when donnie wandered onto the set.  He is not a self made man, this donnie, but watch trump the candidate, self unmake himself and unmask more than a few of his fellow republicans along the way. 

477
What seems to me to underlay your response, is a vote for trump. And you are right to begin with, he is a fool. Please do not mix a rational concern with Mr. Trump's stuff.

Ambition trumped authenticity.  His 180 turn on corn ethanol requirements tells non-farm state voters all we need to know

You are so wrong... You think trump speaks for the African Americans? Hahaha... He hates African American too. He hates Obama and just went on CNN and said that he's not surprise that the young African Americans have not been supported by our black President. That they are worse of now than they have been.

Let us not forget his Trump University being sued for fraud, with this from the Times's report:  "...the operation did not have the license necessary under state law...At one seminar, participants were told they would get to have their pictures taken with Mr. Trump; it ended up being with a cardboard cutout."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/opinion/inside-donald-trumps-university.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/opinion/inside-donald-trumps-university.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/opinion/inside-donald-trumps-universit...</a><br/><br/>How sad his defenders accept his explicit disdain for them, an unexplored level of self-hatred that is its own story.  

481
It seems to me charlatans and braggadocios selling us snake oil is as American as apple pie. So is the silly season in politics that occurs at the beginning of our bloated election cycle. Trump is unelectable. We all know that. Even he knows that. He has the cash to force us though this exercise in trumpabation. One thing we can hope for is a better communication with our neighbors to south as he forces us all to agree for once on one single fact: This piñata is filled with hot air. 

482
It's not clear to me why Mexicans are driving down wages.  Why do people who hire them pay them less than Americans for the same work?  Isn't the work what you are paying for, not the ethnicity of the worker?  Isn't the work worth the same amount of money regardless of who does it and shouldn't the same amount be offered to anyone who can do it?  If the ethnicity of the workers is, for some inexplicable reason, relevant, then why not hire a nice white American at American wages?  I can only hope that at some point it is determined that Mr. Trump himself has hired undocumented aliens to save a few bucks here and there, like all the other "law-abiding" citizens of the United States who hire undocumented aliens for the same purpose.  In our society, the accumulation of money trumps all, doesn't it?  We throw many of our own citizens under the unemployment bus to get cheap goods and services from those who are not, and then seek to punish the ones we hire for doing the work cheaply.  Quite amazing, isn't it?

In Donald Trump's speech, he addresses the Mexicans only, but I feel like he addresses all of the Latino community. Whenever I go somewhere where there is people, the people there automatically assume that I am Mexican, just because I speak Spanish and look Hispanic. Therefore, they believe that I bring trouble to the USA like Mr. Trump says in his speech to the Mexicans "They are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They’re rapists." People stereotype that all Latinos are from Mexico and that's why I believe that Mr. Trump is talking about the whole Latino community.<br/>This article also caught my attention because I believe that Mr. Trumpet is racist and I believe that America should not have a president that is racist. Even thought Mr. Trump has money, he is not going to win presidency by talking junk of Mexicans.

And Now, What Mexico Thinks of Donald Trump<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infa...</a>®ion=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news<br/>	Racism has affected people of various races for a long time, and recently, Donald Trump insulted Mexicans, specifically those living in the United States, by saying that the Mexicans “are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Because of this, many have grown angry with Trump.<br/>	What makes this article interesting to me is that I am constantly surrounded by Mexicans, and my view is nothing like Trump’s.  Being surrounded by my Mexican family, and various Mexican friends, it is hard to clearly understand why someone would feel as Trump does. While Donald Trump believes Mexico only sends criminals, I believe we have much to offer, and we can be as helpful as anyone else. Therefore, Mexicans deserve to live in this country as much as anyone else, and the problems in the United States are not only caused by Mexicans.<br/>	Another reason I found this article interesting was because of how much attention one person’s opinion received.  Despite the fact that Donald Trump could not really do anything about the Mexicans living in the United States, many people responded with anger.  Although I understand their anger, it still seems strange that one person’s pointless opinion can cause so much backlash.

"Breaking Silence, Dzokhar Tsarnaev Apologizes for Boston Marathon Bombings"<br/>I love the marathon. I love the way my entire city crowds 26.2 miles of road, from Hopkington to Boylston, year after year, in order to watch thousands of runners hurtle through Boston's notoriously winding and exhausting course.<br/>In 2013, I had left my spot on the marathon course, and returned home to tackle a history paper, when a CNN alert informed me that there had been an two explosions in Boston. It seems that every day, one hears tragic news stories from all around the world, but there is something devastating about scrolling through images of a place you know so well, thrust into chaos.<br/>In the weeks that followed the bombing, news headlines trumpeted the resilience that Boston exhibited after the tragedy. Stories surfaced regarding heroes who had rushed to hospitals  to give blood, and put the wellbeing of others above their own interests.<br/>The verdict in the Tsanaev trial seems to have exacerbated the grief brought on by April 15, 2013. As the article mentioned, many "cannot fathom the depth of cruelty that let him to destroy innocent lives," but we need to be at peace with the events. I'm proud of the way that the people of Boston have reacted to this tragedy, but the city's healing needs to continue. Though it is too late to change the verdict in the trial, we can accept Tsarnaev's apology for the "irreparable damage" he has caused. Boston can move on, but we must never forget.

Trump trumpets his trumpet again!  Sorry for the alliteration but it was irresistible.  Trump is what Chris Christie is although the former isn't running a state.  They are both loud, ill-mannered, given to saying things they shouldn't, and excellent at alienating people. New Jersey elected Christie governor for a second time and he's been away from his state more than in it and running it.  Trump, like Christie, makes outrageous statements and expects to get away with it because he's got the money.  Both are bullies and both don't seem to understand how what they say affects other people.  <br/><br/>I think that Trump is more representative of the GOP than the GOP wants to believe.  He's just saying what they say in private.  Remember Romney's taped statement about 47% of us being being dependent upon the government and not paying taxes?  This is more of the same only Trump said it openly.  Perhaps we should thank him and start to challenge all Republican candidates on their feelings about the 99% of Americans who are not rich.  

488
I'm Mexican I live in the USA, and I'm an American citizen. I had been here for more than 20 years. What really upset me about this article is why give Donald trump the time of day? Why do we need to listen to his incoherent ideas?<br/>Let's focus on real news and real candidates.

489
The most significant piece of this article is that " 60 percent of the population ... is under the age of 30".  I would guess that the large majority of this young population has little respect for the current government and would welcome the democratization of Iran.  I hope it will come with time from inside Iran.  But if there is any attack on Iran from the West or from Israel, patriotism and defense of Iran by this population will trump everything else. Any such attack would prove to be self-destructive to the attackers.

490
seriously? trump spoke the truth..we are sick and tired of being invaded by illegal aliens on our southern border AND we are sick and tired of having the Mexican flag flown in our faces.

491
trump isn't talking about immigrants, he's telling the truth about the illegal aliens..

492
FOLLOW THE MONEY  Crime pays.  The appearance of crime without adjudication also pays.  It pays very well. It makes the predatory bail loan agencies rich.  It lines the pockets of owners of privatized prisons.  Access to money clearly trumps the presumption of innocence till proven guilty.  As I understand it, there is no presumptive crime in being unable to raise money for bail.  But effectively, those who are poor are presumed to be guilty.  Guilty of what?  Guilty of poverty!  And we dare point a finger of blame at oppressive treatment of citizens in other countries?  We need to get our own house in order.  All the alternatives listed in this article are cheaper than $300 per night in prison.  For being unable to get bail money.  I mean, for $300 we could send people to the Ritz!  Mental health services to prevent involvement with the legal system have been slashed.  Austerity measures, you know.  To assure that the 1% continue to get 99% of new profits.  

493
Don't agree that trump's remarks have a basis in facts.  A lot of people are reacting to his lack of any basis for his remarks in condemning a large group of people who simply want to make a better life for themselves and their families.

494
So from now on I will use the word trump as interchangable with buffoon, a clownish person who just seeks attention.  He can't be taken seriously and is really just an embarrassment.     

495
Yeah, I like that.  "Don't be a trump," could be the ultimate put-down.

Article:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infa...</a><br/><br/>I used to think that Donald Trump was a decent human being, up until his speech the other day.  When he started making all of these racist remarks and stereotypes I got very mad!  I find that people that commit crimes can come from any race.  Not just minorities, it can be anybody, anywhere.  It is also pretty hilarious that Univision cut off ties with Donald Trump.  Being that it is a hispanic channel, I think they found that Trumps remarks were a bit racist!  I also am hispanic, so I took a bit of offense from Trump.  Even though I am not Mexican, I am still a hispanic, and I find that Donald Trump is really just making statements so he has somebody to blame it on.

497
We all pay into many commonly necessary goods and services, like national defense, snow removal and interstate  transportation systems. Health care (definitely not a market commodity) should be treated the same way, with everyone paying in...just as the original CONSERVATIVE design stipulated. Only because a president, hated by the conservatives, implemented the plan, did they turn on it. Politics trumps common good.

"And Now, What Mexico Thinks of Donald Trump"<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infa...</a><br/><br/>In Donald Trump's run for Presidency, the highest form of leadership in the nation, he proves again and again that he does not possess the qualities of a strong, or even good leader. Our current president, Barack Obama, has won previous elections by appealing and speaking to the minority in America. The latinos, blacks, and indians all are able to form a much more positive opinion on him because of his strong support and understanding of certain communities, unlike Donald Trump. I believe to be a POTUS you must be compassionate and willing to negotiate, not make enemies of a country that borders our own and is heavily involved in trade. By speaking so poorly about the entire Mexican population, calling them rapists, criminals and drug addicts, Trump throws a racial blanket over the country and supports so many ignorant stereotypes that hinder the thriving country. The majority of the Mexican immigrants already in the US prove Trump wrong in almost every way. In cities all across the nation many Mexicans work incredibly hard, from sun up to sun down, help maintain the city, hold steady jobs despite the difficulty of moving to an entirely different country. In attempts to put his name in a better light and continually state how much he loves the country and its people, his bigoted actions prove the nation otherwise.

499
There are many analogies that have been used to describe Mr. Trump and his endless trumpeting, but this is the first time I read one that included the word "quiet".

Trump's Pennsylvania Avenue Billboards: Business Ads Or Political Message?<br/><a href="http://wamu.org/news/15/06/18/trump_billboards_business_ads_or_political_message" title="http://wamu.org/news/15/06/18/trump_billboards_business_ads_or_political_message" target="_blank">http://wamu.org/news/15/06/18/trump_billboards_business_ads_or_political...</a>

Most ordinary people don't look an opportunity to make more money with a job in a higher tax bracket in the mouth. Someone able to move from a minimum wage job to one that  pays three to five times the minimum wage per hour might, in passing, note that the tax bill will go up. However, the chance to make more cash in the aggregate AND advance themselves in any number of ways for the long-term trumps cocnern about tax burden. It's only among the economists who still prize "rationality" or think that matters a lot in the human dimension that this thought makes much sense. 

502
America has a pluralist political system in which outcomes are driven much more by intense minorities than by placid majorities.  Thousands of unfortunate males in this country are paying the price of lobbying by feminist zealots on one hand and puritanical conservatives on the other.  The feminists demand that the victim card trump every other factor.  The puritans can't stand the fact that most Americans no longer share their repressive feelings about sexual activity.  Young men are caught between competing hate groups and really are at risk.  

503
Many Greeks are aware of their heritage cultural heritage. That they will cast a "No" vote, not only because they want to end the sufferings, caused by stringent austerity measures imposed by Greece's creditors, but because they feel obliged to defy, what they see as humiliation and to uphold  an independent and sovereign Greece.<br/>National pride has been the trump card widely played by Alexis Tsipras. Of course it goes down well with many Greeks.<br/>European leaders should let Greece go! It wouldn't be the end of the Euro. It was their mistake, not to have foreseen turmoil and have a Plan B at hand. 

504
“I can see that this fraud is doing extraordinary damage to the brains of American children.”<br/>It is exactly the opposite.  It's this sort of peddling of scientific illiteracy that is doing damage to the brains of Americans adults!  Bravo to Governor Brown!<br/>Scientific consensus is that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks for most individuals, that climate change is real and connected to human activities, and that genetic modification is a useful technology that in the case of plants used as food is safe.  But the guillible public is more likely to believe the pseudoscience and fear-mongering spouted by people like Jenny McCarthy and the Food Babe than the AAAS, AMA, National Academies, etc.  Google searches sadly trump the PhDs...

505
There is absolutely no sense in which the "US created this," or that the "US nation building project of South Sudan was ours alone."<br/><br/>South Sudan fought a decades-long civil war against Sudan. It's not like the US had to trump up a lot of grievances in order to cause them to fight. It shows appalling ignorance not to recognize the substantial causes the South Sudanese had in seeking independence--certainly not just oil wealth, or whatever boilerplate conspiracy theory you want to peddle.<br/><br/>The US provided some training to leaders of South Sudan. The US has recognized the current government, and US presidents have worked with Salva Kiir. That's it. On the other hand, in a piece of moral confusion the US can legitimately be blamed for, it also provided northern Sudan with arms in the 1970s to combat Ethiopia, which was almost certainly bad for South Sudanese liberation.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, when does the desire to criticize America become apologetics for Sudan?

I fell in love with France during my freshman world history course. Our delightful, witty, humane elderly professor was an expert on the French Enlightenment (fascinated by France, adored Montesquieu &amp; Voltaire--Voltaire: “It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets").  <br/><br/>Then I went to France the summer between my junior and senior year in college. It was oppressively hot and humid, and we had to maneuver around the strikes. But, for the first time in my life, I realized what quality of life could be--not how much wealth was ostentatiously and tackily displayed, but a genuine appreciation for aethestics, style, an informed feisty confidence, and a bemused attitude toward humanity.<br/><br/>If many Americans were hoodwinked and bamboozled during the Bush-Cheney years, the French were not. While visiting France, many  French I met immediately wanted to know my opinion of the Bush administration. When I told them, they appeared relieved and then unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Bush presidency and demanded to know what was wrong with the Americans who favored Bush policies. I would tell them Bush was not really elected but appointed by the Supreme Court, and many Americans despised what Bush was doing. Many were aghast we let our Supreme Court do that.<br/><br/>The French take full credit for giving us the Enlightenment, but they don't understand why we abandon it. Neither do I.

Here in the Midwest, we hear a lot of the politics of so-called fear. A good example was last year's Ebola scare - "The government is trying to kill us!" when patients were returned from Liberia for treatment here.<br/>And may I tell you, this is not really fear, it's drama: something to get worked up over, to yell about, to feel important in knowing. Maybe it's a reaction to what Thoreau observed: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." Politicians are well aware of this, and have deftly fashioned an antidote: moral indignation, self-righteousness and various trumpet-calls of doom. Comfortable emotions, which require little of us, and especially, stir no doubts about our easy, convenient, sedentary culture and crackhead economy.<br/>Since the Supreme Court became a target only after the ACA and marriage equality rulings, not as a result of the far more serious threat to our freedoms represented by the Citizens United ruling, it's pretty obvious which side it's coming from.<br/>Inequality is not to be feared. Climate change is not real.  Environmental degradation is acceptable collateral damage of unchecked growth. Terrorism is remotely scary, just a useful stimulant to global arms trade. But we should worry about a same-sex couple with health care.

The anti-gluten people are often the same ones who promote organic food and anti-GMO hysteria.  Will science ever trump these food fads?  I hope so.

In his campaign speech to trail the way to him president, he made crude remarks regarding immigration of those to our south, quoting them bringing drugs and bringing crime across our borders. Results: the pulling of sponsorships and promotions toward Trump. It makes sense in a way. As a president, making these remarks to nations where the situations may not be how it appears in a candidate's mind are unjustified. The world is not perfect Donald Trump and there are people out there who are offended at the words. Even with this and future lawsuits filed against those he is being boycotted against, he is pulling the reigns of the Republican nomination behind Jeb Bush. Hopefully, these comments will reside with peace or the fall of Trump.

And Now, What Mexico Thinks of Donald Trump: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infa...</a><br/><br/>As somebody who absolutely loathes the sort of institution and ignorance that Donald Trump seems to personify, this article was oddly satisfying. He perpetuates capitalist ideals and outdated stereotypes that would make other bigots backpedal. He's a racist, classist fool who deserves every amount of backlash he's received for criminalizing an entire country. Although he has mostly suffered financially, not politically, one can only hope that this affects his campaigning and that the other bigots who support his remarks realize his only interests are in preserving big business--his big business.<br/><br/>It's interesting, too, the point that the Mexican woman brings up at the end of the article: the drugs and the addicts aren't pervading the United States from Mexico. The United States is just as guilty of its own drug trade and addicts, and the United States is not a holy land all Mexicans run to. This is a perspective Donald Trump should try to consider.

511
The principle that religious people's sense of victimization trumps anything in US jurisprudence is an assured recipe for disaster. On one hand, such a principle is totally asymmetric: imagine the outcry if an atheist justice of the peace refused to issue a license for a Christian wedding. More importantly, why aren't we honest and admit that for many religious people, its not only that "my religion" is better than atheism or agnosticism but "my religion is better than your religion". Why not then by this victimization logic accord a justice of the peace of one religion "the right" to refuse a license for marriages of people of a supposedly inferior religion, one whose practices or beliefs offend said justice of the peace?

512
It is a mystery to me how any American can believe that their personal religious convictions trump the legal rights of any other American. That a near majority of our SCOTUS seems to believe this is frightening in a country that was founded in opposition to a King who claimed to govern by Divine Right.<br/><br/>Religious absolutism has no place in our constitutional system, particularly in our Supreme Court.

513
re the baker issue, I have two words: Public Accommodation.<br/><br/>As for the free exercise of religion, I might point out the fact that while "just" 13% of Americans oppose interracial marriage, the number rises to 29% of Republicans in Mississippi, part of the "Solid South". Christians are famous for (a) picking parts of the Bible that support their biases and (b) finding new interpretations when it becomes socially important. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that religion does not trump civil rights. After all, the Episcopalians are just fine with gay marriage, evangelicals not so much. Which view is the right one? That is why the right to practice your religion ends where civil rights begin.

It is up to him to find his happiness, assuming that happiness is a desirable, or obtainable, goal.<br/><br/>Purpose actually trumps (darn it, Donald) "happiness."

I was born before there were vaccines for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, or Chicken Pox.  Contracted three out of four (never got Mumps, though my sister did.)  I sufferred horribly with Chicken Pox as most of my lesions were internal.  Many who were children at that time still bear the external scars from their diseases.  To any who believe in the anti-vaccine propaganda, you do not want your children to contract any of these diseases.  As to the assertion of a parental right to determine "what goes in my child's body," sorry, but PUBLIC HEALTH concerns trump that sad excuse.

516
The DR has some serious issues, but the statistics and facts that can not be hidden would trump down your statement of portraying the DR as a basket case like Haiti.<br/>In any event, your words would suffice as gospel to justify not letting the DR become another Haiti. Period.

Is she a professor of Anthropology or Literature? She appears to be channeling Orwell, who had Big Brother's government trumpeting "ignorance is strength."<br/>The line about it being better for a man to control a woman's life badly than for a woman to do it well is as offensive to this feminist father of daughters as anything I have EVER read in the Times.

518
230 comments, roughly 200 personal anecdotes. This is unfortunately emblematic of most people's inability to distinguish between anecdotal and real scientific evidence - which depends on statistical analysis of controlled studies conducted on groups or populations. The "placebo" effect in this arena is known to be quite potent, but no one wants to believe that his or her own health benefit is imaginary, and so personal anecdote trumps scientific evidence. That is how late-night infomercials go mainstream, and how pseudoscience spawns very lucrative industries.

Perhaps in light of the blatant money grab the concerts have been not to mention  lackluster performances , especially by Mr Anastasio  along with the over the top Ad's on any  surface  capable of displaying Ads [ thinking of the DirectTV blimp using the ' Dead ' bears to promote DTV ] methinks the ' Dead' over the years have become Too American . As in .. Greed trumping quality and authenticity . As if anyone in the Dead were in need of money . Amazing over the years how many including the Dead , Ben &amp; Jerry's etc have been willing to sacrifice it all along with all of  us  in the pursuit of manna

In my view, whatever decision the European bloc agrees upon, it clearly will set a framework for the future. The geopolitical repercussions are huge and must not be taken lightly. It is not matter of simply the potential exit of Greece as a signal to bankers, investors and the ordinary taxpayer there interest trumps Greece. If the Greek temper tantrum is rewarded what signal do you send to Portugal, Spain and Ireland who drink the Kool aid? What rules you matters and which  don't mean as much. Don't take the IMF comments out of context. They reached this conclusion only after the current situation plunged the country into deeper trouble. <br/><br/>My instinct was to support Greece mainly because the brunt of the austerity adversely affected the average person.  But my feeling are 180 degrees different because Greek leaders and their supporter act if they are entitled to a different agreement at the cost of others. And that bothers me.  Yes, elections matter, however the rules don't change when the players change. Greece's situation is a result of systemic, incompetent management and leadership.  <br/><br/>Democracy spoke loud and clear. The current bailout package is not acceptable. European response must be equally compelling.  No more cash

521
We shall see what country is stupid enough to continue to lend Greece money, as these governments will be under internal pressure not to lend any more funds until there is a firm repayment schedule that can be met!  Remember that economics often trumps politics.

522
I understand your point about economics trumping politics - but we need to remember the example of 1919,  when what Keynes called a "Carthaginian Peace" was forced on Germany  - setting the scene for a financial collapse a decade later,  a worldwide depression, the rise of Nazism and fascism - and another world war.  Also, consider the several economic crises the Russians had in the 1990s.  Somehow the big lenders always came back.  Western nations couldn't do otherwise -and not only because at the time it seemed there was a real lot of money to make there. <br/><br/>Even if Greece defaults to the tune of hundreds of billions, the financiers will come back - quickly - to lend it more. <br/><br/>Western and Asian central banks  - in a world continually threatened with global deflation - are constantly printing up new money for those financiers to lend. Those banks been doing so practically since the end of Soviet communism and the rise of Asia's economies - especially China's economy - a quarter century ago<br/><br/>And that constantly created money MUST be loaned somehow  - it can't be put into a giant mattress somewhere.  Central banks will have to continue to crank out money - which in our contemporary world is just the other side of debt - until somehow our global economy starts to tick upward markedly. <br/><br/>That global economy will either shrink further - or grow: there's never been such a thing as a static no-growth equilibrium with capitalism.

523
Why does the NYT believe that nations should not be allowed to enact or enforce their own immigration laws? Everyday brings a new piece in the Times urging nations to fling open their borders, despite the overwhelming and demonstrable feelings of these nations' populaces that they do not want open borders. Apparently the Times believes that its far-left open borders philosophy trumps the democratically-expressed wishes of the citizens of more developed countries who do not wish their nations to become third world countries by means of unfettered immigration. That is appalling hubris.

524
The big US health insurance companies pushing to raise rates sharply is another example of ideology trumping practical measures that would benefit the millions.  The right wing has shown it will stop at nothing.

The ferocious divisions along class lines in Mexico are discussed in an interesting column on Slate this morning.<br/><br/>Perhaps some of the divisions in LA are a reflection of the new population.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/mexican-elites-secretly-agree-with-trump.html" title="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/mexican-elites-secretly-agree-with-trump.html" target="_blank">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/mexican-elites-secretly...</a>

526
Why is there a crisis?  According to Krugman, Greece's profligate "Keynesian stimulus" should have caused the economy to boom.  Answer: because waste trumps stimulus every time.  Greece, Detroit, 1970s USA.  Austerity/stimulus is a small part of the situation.  Greece wastes money on the old Democratic scam of paying for votes.  Continuing that will make things worse.  The creditors demands are to end the waste.<br/><br/>I think Krugman is basically having a years' long tantrum that Greece proves his economic policies are horrific and Greece is an acute example of that.

The one reason why Donald Trump should stay in business and not politics.<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infa...</a><br/>Donald Trump as we all know is a business person and owner of entertainment programs within the country. His views towards business has inspired as in all ways, but this past month he really showed us his truth and thoughts against the people of our neighboring country. In my perspective of the topic, I cannot even understand how a man of wealth is willing to improve our nation by talking crucially towards civilized people. What brought up my attention was not only what this man said but what affects and consequences come in return. Major corporations such as NBC and Univision will refuse to display his entertainment programs such as Miss. Universe due to the insults made to a large minority. Race, ethnic groups, nationality, and religion are all factors for a person such as president Obama to deal with fairly and respectfully in order to be successful. Diversity is a major factor in success especially in business because when it comes to culture, not every race is better in working in certain fields than others. Its why there is good structure in companies that work with Mexicans from labor to administration. Like it or not, our economy could not be the same without Hispanic people working and embracing a stronger working ability in the fields we feed on and the clothes we warm up with. 

528
The Clinton campaign better be worried.  I'll vote for her - unless I have the option to vote for someone better: Bernie Sanders.<br/><br/>I attended a DNC planning meeting in Virginia in 2007 with sincere plans to volunteer for Hillary.  That was the day I first met Senator Barack Obama. So much for Hillary!  She can raise billions of dollars but retail politics works.  Give people the opportunity to meet a candidate they believe will truly represent their interests and it will trump money in Iowa and New Hampshire.  <br/><br/>I've met Hillary and she seems like a fine person.  But this entitled, wary, neo liberal campaign she's running is not what Democratic voters want to fight growing income inequality, gun violence and the nauseating spectacle of the GOP veering ever more crazily rightward while they shut down the government/obstruct President Obama.<br/><br/>Obama's been a terrific, gutsy progressive President and I'm proud I worked to elect him.<br/><br/>Hillary underestimated Obama in 2008 and there are signs her current lackluster campaign is as clueless as 2008. That's no surprise because the same inside the beltway types who ran her uninspired 2008 campaign run Hillary 2016.  Her extreme cautiousness in bringing back these conservative old establishment hacks who ill-served her last time around bespeak wariness, a lack of vision and misunderstanding of the culture - exactly what allowed a more progressive and inspiring candidate to eat her lunch in 2008.<br/><br/>Bernie Sanders 2016.

529
sanders is asking the same question put to the greek nation yesterday, can democracy trump oligarchy? no matter how her handlers spin it, clinton is just another shill for the banksters. 

530
Oh no, not again. How can another dark horse candidate possibly threaten Hillary's coronation again? Ok, we can understand how Barack Obama did it by making history as the first black ever to ascend to the highest office in the land. That even trumped the national desire for the first woman president. Alright, but now THIS? Who in the world is Bernie Sanders to possibly threaten the presumed ascendency of Hillary as the first woman president THIS time? How could it be? It must be a dream. Hillary made a huge mistake underestimating Barack Obama in 2008. Could she be doing it again with Bernie Sanders? I mean, we all can understand the appeal of Barack Obama, but BERNIE SANDERS??

531
The oft-repeated argument I hear is that Hillary is electable, but Bernie is not.  Yet if I recall correctly about eight years ago this was the same justification for supporting Clinton's candidacy.  The MSM was trumpeting the inevitability of her nomination then as well.<br/><br/>It is early enough, and support for Sanders is strong enough, that I think dismissing his candidacy as anything other than one that will be legitimately contesting the nomination may ultimately make one look foolish.   Did Obama look any stronger than Sanders this time eight years ago?<br/><br/>I think Hillary Clinton's best shot was 2007.  She has tremendous political capital (and financial), but support for her seems to be listless.  Her candidacy reminds me of two previous ones:  Robert Dole (the sentiment that it was "his turn" to be president) and Mitt Romney (too much politicking, too little substance).<br/><br/>I happened to be living in Iowa in 2008, and I caucused for Obama.  Believe me, most of us who voted for him didn't think we were voting for the next president then (after all, a Clinton nomination was inevitable).  But we felt that we were making a stand for something we believed in, and it felt good to be excited about that.

532
I just spent 3 days observing my two nieces, 12 and 15. They spent anywhere between 8 and 14 hours staring at their smartphone screens per day. The only time they put the phones down was to eat or to move the charging cord from the house to the car.<br/><br/>I had a good mind to tell my sister-in-law that this is plainly and self-evidently unhealthy and that it borders on child abuse; but one doesn't criticize one's spouse's family without risking ostracization. Social mores evidently trump child health.

I thought perhaps some had learned in the 2008 and 2012 elections that money did not buy or guarantee success.  History has shown that ideas trump money and what if Bernie's idea's time has come?  What if his performance/entertainment value keeps these ideas in the media and before the public?  <br/><br/>Powerful stuff.   <br/><br/>Hilary and her team are running amazing old school campaign for the 20th Century that is long gone.  Her time seems to have come and gone.  The perfected Hilary is not what is or will resonate in the 2016 21st Century.

Ms. Price wrote:<br/>"I love weddings. I love the ritual, the coming together of chosen and biological families, and the cake. The weekend before Justice Kennedy gave the majority opinion in the Obergefell v. Hodges case, I watched my 5-year-old bear the rings for the wedding of his beloved godmama to her new wife. Yet in my exceeding happiness for them, I recognize that the ultimate battle is to remove any requirements of marriage or coupledom from any of the important benefits they are attached to, and to allow people to design the kinds of intimate networks they choose. Why can’t I designate a person of my choosing in the absence of a spouse to receive health benefits earned through my labor if they 'embody … family and sacrifice' for me?"<br/><br/>More and more essayists use personal experience to essentially up the ante in an argument--to make the argument stronger, more believable. Thus argumentation is trumped by an appeal to the validity of the writer's experience. However effective this may be in convincing readers, it is convincing only if you trust the writer, her voice, and the editor to have selected that writer--and if you like to be convinced by one person's experience and not a larger argument. Is this piece an essay or a rhetorical opportunity?<br/><br/>I think Ms. Price's integration of her wedding experience into her argument is done rather awkwardly but it will be effective nonetheless. I agree with her--but not due to her mix of wedding experience and point of view.

So the child and her sister go through a horrendous ordeal, and Oprah Winfrey - with all her money - had to capitalize on it by making a public spectacle of a family reunion that promised to be wrenching. That's pure  capitalistic insensitivity.  Even Oprah Winfrey has to make sure there's something in it for her.  It was just too good a story for her to be benignly generous and fly the family out without all the hoopla. I guess ratings trump all. <br/><br/>I've never seen a single person in the course of my life come through the years unscathed.  Life is hard, but for Clemantine and Claire, it was obscenely cruel, and it never should have happened.  <br/><br/>I must be missing Mr. Brook's point, because I see little else here but a  continued glaring abdication of human responsibility.

536
Or, perhaps, there IS always a fault in his writing. Diane Moses captures the problem beautifully. There is a deep disconnect between Mr. Brooks and the downtrodden of this planet that is not paved over by trumpeting "character" or the "courage of small things" when we desperately need large things.

537
The drama being played out has the following actors:<br/><br/>A bankrupt country that joined the EU by falsifying their economic data in order to join a club that offered cheap money. Where politicians spread the wealth of other people's money to a corrupt society where citizens dodge taxes with a government uninterested in collecting them.  Where the government worker earns 3.5x the private sector worker and then demands bribes to do their work, to boot. Then retirees at 50.  <br/><br/>The European banks that financed the party in search of outsize returns and now pressure the EU to protect their money by offering more credit while they desperately hope for a chance to escape. <br/><br/>The EU powers that follow the yellow brick road in search of a land where banks are safe to loan to irresponsible and corrupt bankrupt borrowers that trumpet their right to a standard of living provided by the efforts of others.  <br/><br/>This drama has no way of ending happily, especially if the politicians figure out how to save the banks on the back of the taxpayers.<br/><br/>Leave the Greeks to their own devices (and vices), and the banks will take the hits they deserve, Greece will exit a party they shouldn't have be been invited to and the Greek people will learn to live within their means - not because they want to but because they will have to.<br/><br/>Or save the Banks.

538
All constitutional really means is that 2/3 of congress and the President agree to make it a law....Don't forget this......Any law can be redefined, trumped with constitutional law and just because we only have 20 or so amendments now doesn't mean those numbers couldn't balloon rather quickly in future years.....If the majority decided to declare holy war, further decided to crucify people who were considered nonconformists then it could be sanctioned with a constitutional amendment....Always consider what you are voting for, never upset the majority

As an avid pedestrian, who lives near two major bike routes, I have come to almost hate almost all cyclists in this city, whether they are male or female, on a citibike or their own. Many have this attitude that bikers trump everyone and everything, cars, trucks and especially pedestrians. They pay no attention to traffic signals or crosswalks and zigzag through traffic. I constantly have to stop for them when I am walking across the street, even when I have  the right of way and sometimes even on sidewalks. Citibike riders sometimes seem particularly clueless, so the thought of  adding more of them to the mix, male or female, makes me cringe. What is needed in this city is more enforcement of traffic lawsUnless something is done to curb the dangers from errant drivers and cyclists New York will no longer be known as a pedestrian friendly walkable city. 

540
Class is not just about money. Yes, police officers, carpenters, plumbers, etc. certainly are working class. They do highly important, skillful even impressive work. Some make much more money than middle class people. Yet, a professor making $50k will be taken by most everyone in every society to be from a different social class from a plumber making $100k. This is as much a result of the kind of work done, the social circles they are from and overall family and background characteristics as anything else. Of course, ontogeny is not phylogeny. A lot of middle class Americans are downwardly mobile today. And some working class people are upwardly mobile. That, however, is a separate issue.<br/><br/>And this has nothing to do with intelligence. A journalist once asked economist John Maynard-Keynes if he was impressed with Albert Einstein's brain. He stated that he was far more impressed with the millions of people picking cotton or digging potatoes who had Einstein's brain but would never have an opportunity to maximize their potential. I know carpenters who are brilliant. I have medical colleagues who are morons Yet, even the most mediocre of physicians trump all but the most successful of carpenters. That's how our world works, right or wrong.

541
Once again greed is trumping sense and long term effects.  The real problem being that the environment has been messed with therefore less fish.  Unfortunately fishermen have to be creative and might have to figure out an other way to make a living.  Part of the problem has been foreign fisheries destroying fishing grounds by trawling and over fishing for years.  

542
To me, the bottom line is a lack of empathy coupled with a total comfort in being selfish (to one's own heritage at the expense of others' feelings).  The flag offends a great number of folks, in a pretty intense and awful way.  To some, it stands for something quite bad.  That's enough of a reason for it to be removed from all public grounds.  You want to fly an offensive-to-some flag on your property, fine, but if the grounds are public, and government-owned, operated, regulated, etc., then the flag should be one that does not have racist meaning to a significant segment of the population (or so obviously offend in some other way).  That is common decency.  Heritage does not trump (pun) common decency or the values of our nation, the United States of America (of which those towns, cities, counties, and states reside).

543
I do wonder if Germany is being near-sighted. Don't they see the cultural, social and political waves that they are creating and the potential for all of the "fringe nations" in those dimensions.  Economics may trump everything in the new Germany, but they may be setting up a very dangerous future for Europe.

544
By what rule of journalism does the front page have to present these trumpets of disinformation, foolishness and intolerance as if they were serious, thoughtful honest candidates?  Would it not serve the public good if the name of each were followed by a fitting epithet. A well chosen word or two attached to every instance  of their name in print, or sometimes substituting for that name would work wonders.  Nor are these three the only passengers in the clown car whose public persona would be made more accurate by such treatment.<br/><br/>Perhaps Mr. Rosenthal would sponsor a contest.  Or maybe commission the NY Times chief commenter in verse, Larry Eisenberg, to have a go.<br/><br/>A few to get started:<br/>Chris Christie: the hair triggered bully.<br/>Donald Trump: the snarling buffoon<br/>Ben Carson: Doctor What?

545
I played lead trumpet in a swing band for a few years. We did a Dixieland set that was always a hit.

Greece should default. They should stiff the troika. Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and anybody else that was victimised by the banksters fraud leading up to the crash in 2007 should do they same.<br/>These laissez faire, fascist, crooks need to be destroyed financially. GINI  co-efficients need to plummet for balance to be restored.<br/>The rich must be told that human values trump profit. That the life of the poorest African child is worth as much as any royal Charlotte or George.<br/>Given the unearned privilege of these children and massive amount of public  money slavished on them for an accident of birth, I think they are born with a debt they can never repay.<br/>Down with monarchs, plutocrats, and oligarchs.<br/>We hold these truths to be self evident. All men are created equal.<br/>Woe be to those who forget this basic truth.

547
CLEAN UP TIME  If BP and the government sign on to the settlement outlined it will provide funds for cleanup.  In theory, the federal government's oversight and  EPA regulations could be grounds for structuring the states' restoration programs.  But, given Bobby Jindal's anti-evolutionary position about education in LA and the likelihood of others adopting an un-intelligent design (of science curriculum that is) forebode ill for the proper expenditure of funds earmarked for environment cleanup.  After all if a divine force created the universe according to biblical metrics, that same divine force may have purposefully created the BP disaster as part of the "perfect" design scheme.  If that is the case, the pols in those states may claim that the earth itself, given its divine provenance, will heal itself.  I have not the slightest doubt that the creativity of the creationists is rivaled only by their arrogation of the role of divine will in creation, which they fully intent to trump.  Or is that Trump?

548
fired from what exactly? a meaningless exhibition? the pga tour will show whether it has any spine if and when it withdraws its involvement with trump from big annual tournaments like the one in Miami formerly known as The Doral. does anyone really think that is going to happen?  of course not. 

549
david remnick of the new Yorker magazine said it best: trump is a grotesque buffoon

550
we used to have the "thumper rule," which was brought to us by walt disney by way of the movie bambi ("if you can't say something nice then don't say anything at all" if my increasingly faulty memory serves me well here).  now we have the "trumper rule," which is pretty much "say whatever outrageous thing you want without any consequences."<br/><br/>i miss the "thumper rule."

551
True, the gift of himself, The Donald - the man with the Edsel mouth and flyaway orange comb-over - is a great and grotesque gift to his rivals, the entire field of Republican Conservative wannabe POTUSes.  Bullying, bigotry and brass have bought Donald Trump his Ozymandian empire.   And all the Republican candidates are allowing The Donald to push them into untenable positions. Indeed, Frank, the wasted gift of trumping Trump could redeem and rehabilitate the GOP contenders within the 17 months tll Election 2016. In the meantime, The GOP candidates must be winnowed, the few possible kernels of wheat from the mountain of chaff and blabber hewing to the Tea Party line of baloney.  The Republican candidates en masse or separately must read Trump the riot act,  just as they should have raised cain with the lunatic fringe in 2012, which cost them their 2nd Election, and happily kept President Obama in The White House for eight years. Trump is the Tar Baby in Uncle Remus's Song of the South and no GOP candidate dares to grab him firmly with Tyvek-gloved hands. The Donald is direct, says what he thinks, and is number two in polls. True,  that Trump is crass, a bigoted bloviator, but his fellow Republican contenders have zipped their lips, blinkered their eyes, and won't deal with The Donald as they should - more's the pity for the GOP's chances to "take back" the White House.

552
Nonsense---<br/><br/>The whole thing will end when Greece demands reparations from Germany for the war....and when Germany refuses, which....it will not.<br/><br/>It would be nice if the Press engaged in better analysis.<br/><br/>How hard is it to understand that smart players don't reveal their trump.<br/><br/>Angela Merkel can't have Greece leaving the Euro Zone.  She can't.  And if you don't understand why, then you don't understand the Euro Zone.

If Mr. Donald Trump does not become our next President, he could be known as 'The Savior of Greece'.  How?  Why, by expanding the golf courses on the Greek Islands, and extending the summer season for the golfers among us.  We are not only planning to rest on the beach but look forward to delicious meals and wine, pleasant hotel and lodging accommodations, with access to viewing the rich cultural artifacts of the Country.<br/><br/>Mr. Trump is known, among his other assets, for being a champion supporter and player of one of the most popular sports in the World, and instead of wandering into a gladiator ring where he is going to get trumped, perhaps he will consider pitching his gold golf clubs in a Country where the grounds are fertile for such a skilled game.<br/><br/>He will then be truly remembered as the modern day 'King Midas' who turned Greek bread into golden fare.<br/><br/>As to the P. 

554
First, he's not serious about being president.<br/>Second, he will drop out of the race before financial disclosures.<br/>Third, Republicans in Iowa and NH have had strong polling for nut jobs every election cycle.<br/>Fourth, if you even entertain his filthy argument, let's remind Mr. trump that we get rapists and psychos from all over the world. We actually have them born in bred right here. The Cheshire meth animals, Newtown, Newtown, Aurora, Charleston. Most of our prolific rapists have been home grown.<br/>Fifth, with the birther nonsense. Does anyone really think that if the was a shred of truth to that, the Clinton machine wouldn't have been all over it?<br/>Finally, he's just not serious. Not because he gets an audience but because he 100% does not want the job. He wants the attention. I don't know what happened to that guy as a kid but his need for recognition is pathological.

555
WHERE'S SARAH?  Palin, just when we need her the most?  If she could only give lessons in rhetoric and clarity of thought to The Donald, that would hone his redoubtable skills as an orator.  Nay, as a political philosopher.  Or he could realize what Sarah did:  there's much more money to be made as a political commentator and pundit (pun intended) than as a candidate.  But the Donald is awash with money.  The danger for him is that if he ascends to political office (imagine him ascending as if to Heaven on a fiery steed), while he may have money to burn, he may achieve Dubya's reverse Midas Touch, which would cause him to turn gold into poop.  But given the piles Trump is trumpeting around town, stepping into his dumps seems to trouble him not at all.  Indeed, he seems to enjoy wallowing in his own filth.  Raise a joyful stench!  Perhaps what he truly aspires to is to become the Mud Wrestler In Chief.  Still, his greatest inspiration would be to invite Sarah to be his VP Candidate.  Oh the brilliance that will be smeared across the land, the tsunami of execrence.  All that is lacking in the scenario to make it truly superb is the Union Jack.

556
"To be loud and successful, one needs to be charismatic, but Trump lacks that quality." Yes; but Trump "knows" that, In this media-driven political culture, notoriety is charisma, or trumps (sorry about that) charisma: and that almost nothing said or done can be too ugly or crass if more notoriety is thereby generated. So the media must be co-opted at every opportunity to enhance that notoriety; and this article and the flood of comments it generates (please note, Mr. Bruni) and all other media attention, bad or otherwise accorded Trump plays right into his hands. And it may be that the reluctance of other candidates to take him on directly indicate their recognition of this factor.         

557
So you folks want Hillary Clinton. I guess you don't set the bar very high. So what does she have to offer?  A closet full of pant suits from Omar the Tentmaker?<br/>Let's see. Her husband began having affairs in Arkansas, he continued it at the White House (who can forget the cigars and the blue dress) and instead of being the empowered, progressive "woman" she stood by and said that it was a vast right wing conspiracy.<br/>She didn't author one bill in the Senate and only co authored 3 Impressive<br/>Her career at State was highlighted by that magnificent display of avoiding sniper fire in Bosnia. I thought that skill went with NEO in the Matrix trilogy but Hillary brought it back! That black trench coat was her and those black sunglasses<br/>What was really impressive is how she said she destroyed all the emails but didn't! Does that mean she lied? Hillary? Never!<br/>The foundation "forgot" to list 1,000 donors? "wink:" sure they did.<br/>What I really like is taking $50 million from foreign governments at the Clinton Slush Fund. I was shocked, shocked!! when I read that in 2013 they took between $1 million and $5 million from Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE I was flabbergasted. But wait. They rank near the bottom in human rights rankings. But it get's worse! They practice Sharia Law and for the ignorant Democrat that means they suppress the rights of women!How can Hillary be for equal rights when she takes money from these countries?  Money trumps principle with this loser

558
Here we go again. Give us money for nothing. I said it yesterday in a post here on the NYT, that I am more and more convinced that Mr. Tsipras is deliberately pursuing a policy that leads to a Greek exit. He needs to play this game so that he can go back home and put the blame for the Grexit on everybody else's shoulders, just not his. "Look at me, I tried everything, but they won't concede to our demands." Ideology trumps everything else in Syriza land. Good bye, Greece.

559
A true patriot?? When has Trump ever served anything but his own inflated interests?<br/><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-dodged-vietnam-war-medical-deferment-not-high-draft-number-claimed-article-1.109078" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-dodged-vietnam-war-medical-deferment-not-high-draft-number-claimed-article-1.109078" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-dodged-vietnam-war...</a>

That appeals to the logical, intellectual, intelligent, reasonable and balanced mind. The analogy would be to ignoring a small child's bid for attention by acting out - eventually when the kid sees he's failing either to get your attention he'll give it up.<br/>Unfortunately, I think the more appropriate analogy is perhaps to shrugging off that twinge in your chest, that lump in your breast, or that small crack in the foundation of your home. Something is going on under the surface, and if you don't pay attention to it now it will demand your attention later.<br/>Ignoring him means no voice is raised to refute him, and his statements go uncontradicted to an audience that believes his critics are cowed into silence by the power and cogency of his oratory.<br/>I have gotten into the habit of reading comments on sites other than the insulated NYT, where we all tend to speak in words of multiple syllables and complete sentences. But outside this sequestered little haven, the world is full of scary knuckle-draggers and to them Trump's trumpery bling looks impressive.<br/>I'm reminded of the staunchly liberal playwright Arthur Miller, who said shortly before his death that he couldn't understand how GW Bush could have gotten elected - no one Miller knew had voted for him.<br/>'There is a world elsewhere' (Coriolanus) and you forget or dismiss it at your peril.

Trump is the epitome of the ugly American. The fact that golf won't totally divest from trump means the sport will slide into irrelevancy along with him.

there is a style of art called trump loy where something is painted to appear the real thing, but the substance does not exist at all. How appropriate Mr. Trump's name is.

563
I am all for gay rights but it seems lately two things I've noticed;<br/>1  Gay rights trump religious rights.<br/>2  When it comes to Gay rights VS Religious rights the progressive press will only focus on Christianity and never Islam or the Jewish faith which all share similar qualities of same sex, abortion etc.<br/>  Any time you hear a story about a baker that refuses to make cake for a gay couple you know right away that it is a Christian baker and that they have been targeted by gay activists who do not pursue Islamic or Jewish bakeries, only Christians are persecuted.   My Conclusion is from the book "Animal Farm" "All of the animals are equal, only some animals are more equal than others."

564
Sensibility is finally trumping Trump. Enough clowning around, vVery good to see!

565
Thanks for this sensible point - I travel extensively for work (no not corporate work but NGO environmental work with businesses, in India in particular) - and it is apparent that there is a global shift going on to the newer emerging economies - partly because of the huge consuming power of their new middle classes - that trumps whatever we do to set rules and processes in place to ensure fairness in trade. India also shows me the power of trade to support the rise of millions (literally) of people to middle class comfort and integration in the world at large. This doesn't look like a bad thing. As an earlier comment noted - if we developed labor and environmental collaboratives and coordination the way commercial entities and government develop coordinated actions and policies we would see a better balance and be more able to ensure that the benefits of this expansion of economic prosperity, academic achievement and gender and ethnic equality do not have to mean the inevitable destruction of US jobs or the global environment. No doubt there is corporate collusion and bad practices hiding behind some of the TPP secrecy - but trying to stop the process of an economic redistribution around the globe is simply pointless - it's already underway and in many ways an inspiring and positive trend.

566
The main problem in the US is jobs. Donald Trump has an outstanding record of growing jobs, paying his workers well, negotiating with various municipal boards to get his projects secured, and loyalty of his workers. A President with these business qualifications has been lacking for many years; which explains why our economy is growing at a very slow pace. Our focus on cultural issues, abortion, gay marriage, political correctness has turned our country into a weaker economy. All the comments here deal with these issues, not competence in growing good, well paying jobs.<br/>Most of the candidates in both Democratic and Republican parties do not have these qualifications.<br/>See: <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/06/20/donald-trumps-resume-backs-his-run-for-president/" title="http://nypost.com/2015/06/20/donald-trumps-resume-backs-his-run-for-president/" target="_blank">http://nypost.com/2015/06/20/donald-trumps-resume-backs-his-run-for-pres...</a>

567
One has only to look at Jochen Bittner's op-ed in today's Times to see that "the Greek program" was all about fantasy and moralizing and not reality.  Bittner blithely dismisses several years of Greek economic carnage and suffering as "reform" when "progress was made," now regrettably rolled back by a radical government.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/jochen-bittner-its-time-for-greece-to-leave-the-euro.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/jochen-bittner-its-time-for-greece-to-leave-the-euro.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/jochen-bittner-its-time-for-gr...</a><br/><br/>Mr. Bittner asks "Does democracy trump debt" And concludes that it does not. But does debt trump freedom and sovereignty and human dignity?  Those concepts are not in his purview, and Europe will continue to tear itself apart as long as Mr. Bittner and his kind and their self-satisfied, appalling views have currency in the halls of power.

568
The 'trumpster,' is all about himself.  Now that he has insulted Hispanics, which he has done a very good job of, he hasn't articulated how he'll deal with congress, who can't be herded in any one direction, headed by a speaker who can't lead, but is quite effective in getting post offices named after public officials.  What is the 'trumpster's' position on getting the USA's transportation problems resolved?  He touts himself as making deals all the time.  business contracts are one thing, foreign affairs are another and are very complex.  He is often says 'in talking with a very smart guy (person)' seems to give him insight, but he doesn't say what HIS position or WHAT HE would  do.  Simply put, he's very shallow.

569
Oh, brave new world that has such creatures who actually tell the truth (Trump and Sanders) about what the American public REALLY thinks.  The problem for conservatives and Republicans in general is that Trump is trumpeting the opinions the mainstream morass of that benighted group actually believes!  We on the left couldn't ask for a much better candidate to drag the mantle of respectability off the oligarchs, and the poor fools who follow in their wake... including, obviously, the author of this piece.  

570
I believe trump is a democratic mole in the Republican Party, a double agent of sorts. Every action he takes serves to increase the chances that his friend, Hillary Clinton, will take the presidency in2016. 

571
I used to think Trump just enjoyed being outrageous and egotistical, while also promoting his businesses.  To think there is no other "real" person under all this mean-spirited, self-serving  verbal bombardment -  and let's not forget his own greedy  use of China for manufacturing his own clothing line (while many times criticizing the same involvement of others) - is a lesson about where human frailty can go. It is not the Trump Show, after all. Like Shakespeare's Caesar, the Trump trumpets himself above all. 

572
Citizens' rights from religion trump citizens' rights of religion. <br/><br/>America isn't the place it was before the civil war and the civil rights amendment. Citizenship means getting the right sooner or later to defend oneself from discrimination in housing, employment, public services and from private businesses who offer services to the public. <br/><br/>Religious freedom doesn't imply a right to deny service to a citizen. It means freedom to worship in the place of your choice, with whom you choose and in any doctrine or practice which does not deny others their rights. For the churches to choose to defend their members' "right" to discriminate against citizens in public or business conduct will be a losing proposition sooner or later, even in front of a court system which gives wide tolerance to religious views and practices. No minister or priest needs to be legally compelled to marry gay couples but the registry clerk, the pizza place, the photographer and the cake-maker deserve to lose, and they will, sooner or later. <br/><br/>It may be a long and painful trail to get there but the haters will lose, just as the slavers and racists before them lost. Any God of love is not likely to have mercy upon their souls.

“And Now, What Mexico Thinks of Donald Trump”<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infamy-in-mexico-for-comments-on-immigrants.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/world/americas/donald-trump-gains-infa...</a><br/><br/>This article was definitely stimulating, and caught my attention. To begin with, Donald Trump’s remarks about Mexico were derogatory and the epitome of prejudice. I find his statements extremely offensive; I am not of the Mexican decent either, frankly I just have morality. Stereotypes do not define any ethnicity at all. Especially in our country, discrimination and animosity between races is too common and has been since it formed. What was said was ignorant and sparked the quarrel between Trump and the Mexican people.What is shocking to me is that he had the temerity to disrespect the people of Mexico, yet still believes that he will win Latino votes in the election. It is explicit to me that everyone has the right to have opinions, but not every single one should be announced. At the end of the day, his words backfired at him somehow. NBC and Univision severed ties with him and Macy's stopped carrying a line of clothes branded by him. I guess we'll just have to wait and see how this controversial situation will turn out and the affect it has on him in the election.

574
First and foremost, the assumption that everybody held was that, no matter the differences, both Greeks and Germans were part of the European project --that Greek citizens shared a future with Germans, and that in modern Europe both peoples could count in the basics, i.e. access to cash, fuel, medicines, food.<br/><br/>But Germany and Brussels have initiated what can only be called economic war on Greece. Yes, perhaps when two states are at war as it is Ukraine and Russia, the former shuts access to fuel and tries to destroy its enemy's economy. But not even Russia could shut down Ukraine's economy.<br/><br/>To see the banks in Greece collapsed, its peoples destitute, and without even money to buy basics while shelves go empty. That is unconscionable and a tragedy; How will the Greeks ever be able to forget these years and these months? The resentment against Germany, whether justified or not, will echo through the years, poisoning their relationship, and introducing a sense of enmity that strikes at the heart of the security of Europe, And this just when a militaristic Russia is on the rise and a crisis of migrants and intractable unemployment settles down in all of Europe.<br/><br/>Germany's leaders seem to have forgotten that political goals always trump financial imperfections, and that the strategic place of Greece for the security of Europe trumps loan considerations.

575
To the contrary, we are not quick enough to consider the implications of hacking on public infrastructure. We are sold a bill of goods about the virtues of an interconnected world by corporations, whose only interest is profits, not the general welfare. They forever trumpet how we are just one step away from a secure internet, when the reality is the exact opposite: greater interconnectivity and complexity increasing the damage from hackers and from internal malfunctions. We are merely one step away from one more step. Let's face it, the bad guys are just as smart and, arguably, more motivated than the good guys.<br/><br/>Whether the NYSE computer breakdown was from a hacker or not hardly matters. Nor does the NYSE going down matter to most people. However, when the electric grid or the flight control systems are hacked or have "technical glitches", we will not be talking inconvenience, we will be talking body counts. And let no one say such is an unforeseen consequence. "Oops, I'm sorry" should grant one neither moral nor legal immunity.

576
No, vengeance is Human, but it is not right.<br/><br/>Christ said that he was "the end of the Law," referring to the Commandments and Hammurabi Law. He said that all law was reduced to: "Treat your brother as you would have him treat you." Ipso facto, the wronged survivors of a crime must restrain the dangerous, re-educated and strengthen those who can change, but for both, set an example that is seductive in its goodness. Ongoing anger by the injured is good for neither. Wisdom has always trumped Law.

Jean-Claude Juncker's "Grexit scenario prepared" notwithstanding, I think once again the ideology of the Eurozone Hotel California -- "you can never leave" -- will prevail over the economics.  The EU will hobble along "united" crowing about its "achievement."  But then what happens when:<br/>1. Brits vote on EU membership, and the average voter asks himself "do I really want to belong to an outfit where sound economic policy is trumped by ideological imperatives?"<br/>2. Ditto eventually with Denmark, the only other EU member not using or legally obliged eventually to use the Euro?<br/>3. And what about those still outside the Union?  Anybody really believe that a Euro that keeps sick man Greece in the EUrozone is REALLY going to attract Norwegians?  Icelanders?  And especially Swiss, who always have the weapon of popular referendum to undo even the best laid plans of federal bureaucrats?<br/><br/>"What does it profit a man to gain the whole of Greece and lose Britain, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway...."

Reading her career path on Wikipedia, what, besides the limelight, comes close to her qualifying to be a CEO - of anything? Individual brilliance, if present here, does not trump working with people. I'd like to think any previous managerial experience would have been a prerequisite, but Silicon Valley seems to hold star power in higher esteem.

Yes, Atticus evolved, and most expect someone who has evolved to become better, wiser, stronger.  But, with the civil rights movement,  and the federal government trumping of states' rights to achieve those civil rights,  his world was turned upside down.<br/>I do not believe Atticus was a bigot, I believe he was a good man who could not accept the loss of the entire Southern culture and system he knew and loved.

He doesn't hurt himself at all actually. He may play this little folksy nice guy but he is the dirtiest person running. He's calling out to all the people who find the black president speaking on issues of race, divisive, and they will be drawn to Jeb for saying what he said. He is just as big as a race-baiter as trump, even worse perhaps b/c he's sneakier and more clever about it. You guys need to pay more attention. The press barely called him out on his shady business skirting FEC laws and have yet to point out his being a member of PNAC that pushed the Iraq war years before Bush W. was in office. He is the shadiest of them all and either the press is not picking up on it or they are covering for him. So this tiny little call out does little to expose him for what he really is.

I'm not comfortable with the tone of this article. As someone who is a member of a community land trust, I know that affordable housing projects take perseverance, a joyful heart, and a thick skin. We make some uncomfortable: We alter the landscape; we assist a few low income families acquire housing at below market rates (with resale strings attached) while others see the more subtle benefits. We are proud of those alterations. They advance livability, resiliency, and safety in our neighborhoods---and we trumpet the contributions of our families. We set high standards in energy efficiency, maintenance, preservation of the public subsides, and---foremost---communication. We build community knowing success can be measured by what stories we tell ourselves. Hunkering down is inevitable only if you buy into status driven consumerism. We don't worry about keeping up, we don't hide from the working parts of our buildings, our society. We keep ourselves mindful, we keep the basement door unlocked.

I'll ask the hard question that needs to be stated:<br/><br/>If Sandra Bland did not commit suicide in her jail cell, how did she really die?<br/><br/>Did the cop use the stun gun and kill Sandra (who was epileptic) by triggering an epileptic seizure, then covering it up with a trumped up "suicide"?  Did the cop put the trash can in the cell after Sandra was dead to fake suicide by hanging?<br/><br/>Whose finger prints are on the trash can, the trash bag, the Bible, and whose DNA is on Sandra's clothes, skin, and was she sexually assaulted?<br/><br/>Why was the cop not wearing a video camera? Or was he?<br/><br/>Hard questions that will get answered, because we the public are on the case.<br/><br/>From where I sit, Sandra was wrongfully arrested, wrongfully imprisoned, and this is a wrongful death.

At the very least, this is a case of abuse of authority. <br/><br/>The officer didn't like her tone and decided to exact punishment - jail - using trumped up charges the pathetic blue wall will back up six ways to Sunday. <br/><br/>In the worst case of course, we're talking murder.  As you point out, a lot of things don't make sense. At a minimum, we deserve a truly independent investigation. <br/><br/>I admit, I assume the worst here. But don't blame me, it seems like everyday there's another black citizen dead after an encounter with a so-called "peace officer ".

After Mitt Romney made his infamous 47 percent remark in 2012, I wondered who the next main Republican presidential candidate would be. So far, the answer would seem to be Donald Trump. The GOP seems to be confused as to why Donald Trump is gaining support, while among the people, the answer is simple. Mr. Trump speaks his mind about what he wants to do as president. If asked a question, he will leave you with no doubt as to how he feels about it. Republican voters in particular love that he is so good at making his views expressed, and the fact that he disregards political correctness for the sake of getting his message across. I think that he is the Republicans strongest candidate for presidency in years.

There are too many conflicting words, actions, and agendas involved in the dysfunctional fight against ISIS--too many trumpeted lies and silenced truths--for this "news" to seem promising. All the governments involved are playing different sides with clearly conflicting arrangements. The machinations of its heavy-handed, megalomaniacal, and Muslim-Brotherhood-affiliated leader make a lot of people very nervous. Mr. Erdogan dangles a very treacherous card with the West: "Push me and I'll pull-out of NATO". China and Russia wouldn't mind. Turkey has the second largest army in NATO (after the US), and the top tenth largest standing army in the world. Turkish forces are very potent.  We don't want Turkey to become a wild-card diverging more from the West. In the meantime, ISIS survives via its commercial pipeline with Turkey. Countless trucks go back and forth selling discounted oil to Turkey. ISIS uses tons of fertilizers to build huge truck bombs. Turks produce &amp; deliver it to them. Injured ISIS fighters come to Turkish hospitals for treatment, enabling them drive back Syria to butcher more women and children. So, for now, Turkey will pick and choose when it (Erdogan) wants to spank ISIS. They'll get to expand a their "buffer-zone" inside Syria. They’re again demonstrating to Kurds Turkey bites back. I strongly doubt Turkey will go shoulder to shoulder with the US/Coalition, or more than dent ISIS, which, so far, isn't in any danger of losing their seats of power.

You're right; we don't know why he asked Bland to put the cigarette out because he didn't tell her, and there is no plausible legal reason why her smoking it should have led to her arrest since no one has claimed it contained anything other than tobacco. There is clearly nothing else that Bland was doing that was illegal since she wasn't charged with anything that happened prior to her illegal arrest. The only charge leveled was the clearly trumped up one of assaulting a police officer, though there is nothing in either of the tapes that have surfaced that indicate anyone but she was the victim of an assault.  <br/><br/>This post is a chilling example of how readily defenders of racist police tactics will blame the victim no matter how flimsy their case. Whatever issues Bland had with previous driving violations, she had no outstanding warrants in connection with them and she wasn't stopped in connection with them, nor pulled from her car because of them, nor charged for anything relating to them. There is simply no plausible reason for her unlawful arrest other than the stupid arrogance and racism of this officer.  He should be charged with false imprisonment and possibly assault, and tried for his crimes.

595
Excellent letter. I am also a White woman, and feel the same. I am skeptical that Ms. Bland killed herself, but if proven to be true, the arresting officer, the sheriff's office and jail employees, and even the judge who allowed her to remain incarcerated for such a minor and trumped-up charge in the first place all bear responsibility.

The ground is shifting beneath Hillary's feet. Not only does she have s lot to answer for, but she doesn't have a clue how to run her campaign. First she needs to fire all her advisers who are over-managing her and telling her to play it safe. Then she needs to come out swinging and not pretend she's above the fray. We want a fighter not an heir-apparent who has a sense of entitlement. In fact, she should be more like Trump. He has changed the rules of the game and made his opponents look like stammering idiots. Time for Hillary to step it up or somebody else will out-"trump." Elizabeth Warren, the next bid is yours.

I work in a technical/STEM-friendly arena of government.  The area of expertise of study and skills really does matter.  I will say this, however:  Even within the tightly defined and regulated hiring/promotion environment in the government sector, nepotism and/or membership in the Good Ol' (white, heterosexual) Boys Network trumps all.

This week's article, about Donald trump greeting supporters after a rally on July 16 in Laconia, NH, where he drew about 300 people, interested me by one person drawing so many people's attentions after a rally. This was very impressive by a person, that people know or do not know about, to draw 300 people's attentions and greeting many supporters in a smaller state than New York.

The article which I have read today talks about Donald Trump, his decision to run for president, and a little about his campaign. This is a very unsure topic for some people, because of Trumps inexperience with politics, but others find that it gives him an edge. "'I think he means what he says,' says Kristi Eglody...'He loves America, and he wants it to be better. And that's what I love about him.'" So while some like him because of his honesty and innocence to politics, others do not completely trust him, and even criticize his methods. "No one is that direct. No one else is going to speak their mind like that. And he's a bit of a cartoon character, you have to admit." While there is much controversy, it is up to the election to see where people stand, overall.

"STEM specialties have eclipsed the liberal arts as the portal to the executive track and ultimately the corner office in corporate America, even in fields where an English or sociology degree once provided entry...<br/><br/>“You can range further across industries and, crucially, get into management if you’re an engineer or know chemistry and math,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, a Georgetown University professor who runs the Center on Education and the Workforce. Now, “the engineer becomes the director of sales and marketing. In the old days, it was the generalist,” he said."<br/><br/>What this means is brains and hard work trump all in this knowledge based economy. Employers know that STEM degrees are much harder to get and promote/reward those who are smart and worked hard for their diploma. Lib Art majors are also having a tougher time getting their foot in the door these days as many entry level jobs have been outsourced or automated.<br/><br/>What would be interesting would be a comparison study of STEM grads from state U's to humanities majors from top 10 schools. Where do they stack up 1, 5, 10 &amp; 20 years after graduation, disregarding those who go on to get an MBA, MD or JD. I suspect the State U STEM grads out earn the Harvard humanities major by a wide margin. The smartest kids today are those who go into IT with a CS degree from a local state U, or no degree at all. Technology is the greatest equalizer!

My WWII-era parents didn't go to college; they meant well. Still, approval from our friends and relatives when my name made the paper kept up the pressure to maximize class rank and GPA. Ms. McNamara, thanks for that B in Calculus, spring senior year; you helped save my life.<br/><br/>"We don't accept nerds here," trumpeted MIT's "counselor." The nerds told Dad and I about the jumpers (still making headlines 25 years later). I tried to impress their alum interviewer with my want to leave home and be "worldly;" Dad chastised me as an ingrate, I realized MIT had been his secret dream all along. But he stayed true in letting me choose my path.<br/><br/>USC thinks they're Ivy hot-**** more than ever, but back then I felt none of the pressure around me that's killing these kids. They had a "major GPA" and pass/no-pass options. I wish high schools let upperclassmen likewise pick what to focus on and excel in.  <br/><br/>As for the alumni power factor, I graduated with a 3.5 during a recession and wound up with the Feds, surrounded by state-schoolers no less capable. With a disability, I've since had to reinvent myself as a draftsman, tax preparer, and now a media specialist for the blind and deaf. What the system doesn't teach is that life makes some plans for you. The truly successful have had their strikeouts, errors, slumps, and trades. They just modified their stance, looked for their pitch, and kept on swingin.'

Joe Feagin's comments are undoubtedly insightful.  <br/><br/>However, a larger context eludes us.<br/>If race is a construct, and political parties are a construct, and religion is a construct, how come these constructs have so much force in society?<br/><br/>How can human individuals be taught to regard &amp; judge each other by the content of individual character?  How can human individuals be taught to seek and identify nuanced truths that are submerged in a sea of conflict-riven, prejudicial "group-think"?  This is not to say that individualism must always trump a sense of community membership &amp; obligation.  There should be a wise, judicious balance on this regard.  <br/><br/>Human nature also includes a tendency to seek &amp; justify inequitable/unfair gain at the expense of others -- for economic, social hierarchy status benefits, and/or political power.  World history has shown that inequity has been  systematized along racial &amp; gender lines, political/social cronyism,  as well as economically through more complex financial rules that benefit one economic group over another (for example: rent seeking).<br/><br/>There needs to be an equanimous wisdom and a deep awareness of human nature that can help provide further insight and leadership on these issues.

It is not a 'complex issue' at all.<br/><br/>Only .03% of humans are hermaphrodites.<br/><br/>Transgenders like Jenner decide that their own feelings trump reality. But it does not and Jenner is not female, because no person's DNA changes because of their feelings.<br/><br/>If Jenner had decided this at 18 in this insane world, where feelings=facts, then he could have competed in female sports and he would have won every single contest.<br/><br/>That he would have destroyed the hopes and dreams of the other female athletes, whose only mistake in life was to actually be born female?<br/><br/>Women's feelings don't matter.<br/><br/>Only men's feelings matter.<br/><br/>Everyone knows that.

I'm a Jewish-American from a Holocaust family, and I'm disgusted by the vile, insensitive comments by Mike Huckabee that show utter disrespect for victims of one of history's greatest tragedies as well as  President Obama.  Mike Huckabee is only desperately seeking to out trump Donald Trump in order to get the media attention he so crassly desires.  In so doing, he seems to show utter disregard for the suffering of those and their families in order to score a pathetic, petty political point that's ill-considered and, I believe, even dangerous.  Republicans like Mike Huckabee pose a greater danger to Israel than Iran by attempting to defeat the nuclear deal with Iran that will prevent it from building nuclear weapons for at least a decade.  Defeating the deal almost guarantees Iran will have nuclear weapons by the end of this year.  That, to me,  is the real danger to Israel that even many high-ranking Israeli intelligence officials support. Shouting racist-tinged "Fire!" as Mike Huckabee and others Republican candidates continue to do does not allow for rational and respectful discourse, and promotes reckless political action.

607
I think it's great that feel you made the reight decision about quitting your prescription medicines, but your column as a whole strikes me as irresponsible because it really trumpets that medicines aren't really needed,  especially when you consider the number of people with major depressive syndrome that seriously harm themselves or commit suicide each year. Major affective disorders generally require the correct medications for people to live better lives,  and in many cases, refusal to take medications is the gateway to more hell and misery.  I think it takes a courage for people to accept that they have a psychiatric illness that requires medicines and psychotherapy.<br/>From one whose family has greatly suffered from affective disorders

608
All you say about the Republican party is true. Yet they control congress, most governorships and most state legislatures. There is only one firewall for the Democrats right now, the presidency. I sure hope Mr. trump has the staying power to go all the way or run as a third party candidate. Obi-wan Donaldy, you're our only hope.

609
I don't know why anyone is surprised in the least at how Trump is doing. Sarah Palin not only did well among the same hard core conservatives, she won the nomination, and despite losing the election she and her running mate got a respectable amount of votes.<br/><br/>Palin was easily as rabidly right-wing, red meat-flinging, and all the rest of it as Donald Trump, and by the way, the person who put her on the national ticket was John McCain, the man that you get the impression conservatives like Douthat want to elevate to sainthood at times, and the very symbol of the outrage of Donald Trump daring to doubt McCain's worthiness of the utmost respect.<br/><br/>If McCain putting a comically extreme right winger one elderly man's heartbeat away from the Presidency wasn't crazy in the view of Republicans like Douthat, then why in the world would Trump's pronouncements seem crazy?<br/><br/>The Republicans not only deserve this, they created it. Trump is the ID of the party, and by that I don't mean that it's something dark and hidden, Sarah Palin was right out in the open, running for the White House. <br/><br/>What's trumped-up here is not the Donald's popularity but the conservatives' feigned surprise at it. No, Trump won't win the nomination, but then neither did Herman Cain. The fact that they got as far as they did however is a stunning testament to how far the Republican party has fallen. 

610
I've heard he's actually broke and near bankruptcy.<br/>And that this run is just a way to set himself up for lucrative speaking fees to salvage his lifestyle once he drops out of the race - which is his plan all along. <br/><br/>He figured he had nothing to lose by running and hoping he would make a splash…thus "trumping up" his post run marketability. <br/><br/>The Times should look into this.

611
Here's a fact.  You don't get to shoot a person fleeing a trumped up traffic stop in the head

612
People, even after viewing the tapes, and can still come up with a comment like this, are the real problem in this country. Minor traffic infractions do not equal death. The real issue is poor police training, inadequate psychological testing, and egos so big that it trumps reason and self-control. Even if a driver drives off, he's got the plate number, he can call for backup. But no, the mentality dictates that minorities do what I (the cop) wants or they're dead meat. Until recently this was acceptable behavior because it was the cop's word that ruled but video is changing the rules and challenging police veracity. Hopefully the beginning of a new era in police tactics. I imagine just like Tom Brady's cell phone, a lot of cameras are going to break down.

613
Andy, I think I agree with you on the narrow point of the negative effects of big publicity of papers before they are reviewed.  I'm not sure if your narrow message made it through, particularly given the two fairly sensational headlines you used.<br/><br/>But the ballyhoo in advance of publication is the sort of thing has typically been used by the Monckton's of the world, like when they came out with their Ridiculously Biased Simple Model Of Climate That Shows Nothing's Wrong.  The trumpets were blowing waaay in advance on the various blogs he gets attention on.<br/><br/>But science is incremental, and like you've said in the past, no single study changes to overall implications of where our actions are taking the climate.  Sea level will rise by meters, we don't know how long it will take.  Oceans will continue warming, affecting energy available and patterns followed by tropical storms and rainfall patterns.  Not sure how it will play out, but changes are under way.<br/><br/>It would be interesting if you could cover, in a low-key way, the before-and-after results after this one paper gets graduated to the official journal instead of the current open-review location.<br/><br/>It would illustrate the process of presenting ideas and retaining the ones that withstand scrutiny by peers of the authors.

614
if you think your boss from work would make a great president, vote for trump...

615
Far be it from me to defend Donald trump (and I'm not) but the way you've written the punchline here strikes me as deliberately ambiguous.  At the least it is unclear what actually occurred when you state that Ms. Beck took out her breast pump.  Was the Donald saying Ms. Beck was disgusting for displaying the device or for using it?  Or for suggesting that she would use it, as you say of the place this earth-shattering revelation was hiding, in plain sight? 

616
Really?<br/>Where is Mr. trump's moral axis? Or is that not important?

617
Donald Trump<br/>The thing that interest me the most about this article is that a business man is running for president and trying his best to succeed. Another thing that interest me id that if Trump states his opinions in a nice way with offending people then it will be a good chance he will leave with a win. It will show us if he can be a good president or one that would show out for the cameras and fame. He also has not been preparing for the debate he's been playing golf somewhere. It'll be interesting to see who he targets in his debate because he states that he doesn't like some of the Candidates running in the race. Donald Trump is a very judgmental person and likes to make fun at anyone so it'll be interesting to see who he will try to embarrasses this time. Trump also has bad blood with some candidates and it will be interesting to see how it pans out and if it will show a bad dark side of Trump. Mr.Madden said he is"like a big bully going around the neighborhood popping off about how he's the toughest kid on the block." Trump also thinks that debates are a waste and has no influence to who will win? Donald trump has different goals and views on the debates then other Candidates do.Trump fells like like all he needs to impress are the people that have helped him get to the top. He fells he just needs to be confident and he was last longer as a candidates. at the end of the day this is a major event for Trump and he needs to do a good job.

618
Research shows that pay may be instrumental in attracting good employees, but other factors trump money in retaining them. People like to feel they are doing something "good," that they are valued, and they place variables like company climate and co-worker camaraderie very high on their list of reasons to stay. Money is not the primary determinant of worker satisfaction.

619
Let's be honest here for a change. The drugs that are keeping Australians alive longer are a steal -- literally. <br/><br/>Australians live longer because US consumers pay for the development of new life-saving drugs. The Australians are free riders -- they don't pay their fair share of the cost of R&amp;D because their government uses its monopsonistic power to drive the price to the floor. I might excuse that if they were Africans or Indians. But they are one of the richest countries in them world.<br/><br/>No one has a nice word to say about big pharma, so let me try to set the record straight. As a professor, I have looked into the charges against big pharma, and most of them are completely trumped up. <br/><br/>For example, one bogus charge suggests that pharma companies spend money on advertising that might otherwise be spent on R&amp;D. But why does any business advertise? To get more customers and make a larger profit. So advertising makes MORE dollars available for R&amp;D not fewer.

And the lawyers in this story are disgusting as is your story. In 37 years of practicing law and taking and defending hundreds of depositions, some contentious, no one has ever wasted my time, the court reporter's time or witnesses time by engaging in such behavior ---- everyone sit and waste an hour of their time while I go and take care of my personal business.<br/>This lawyer worked at a major law firm that is aggressive litigators and knows the drill. Her husband who wrote to the NY TIMES is her law partner and was present. If she had any medical issues that needed attending, her husband should have been taking the deposition of Mr. trump. You don't take a deposition on the fly. You prepare for hours going over documents, the law, the facts and other testimony. She knew going into this deposition that she was going to play a lawyer game in the middle of the deposition to cause the other side to waste time and get ticked off. Your reporters are a joke. Talk to the NY Times outside counsel and ask anyone over 30 if they would put up with such nonsense at a deposition. Either this lawyer was playing games, or she is a rude, selfish, self absorbed young person who has no recognition or does not care about other people and wasting their time. Bad journalism Times.

The fact that Trump would say something as unprofessional as calling a lawyers questions "really stupid" or call someone "disgusting" in a court of law, really shows what type of person he is, not to mention what type of leader. This article displays Trumps behavior perfectly by quoting rude, inappropriate things he has says that were completely unnecessary, such as "do you even know what you're doing?" and calling a woman "uptight...and disgusting". Trump is known for speaking his mind, but he doesn't seem to know when enough is enough, often displaying no filter as well. If Trump is serious about his candidacy, he needs to change his attitude and show the American citizens that he knows what to say and what not to say. Being the President of the United States takes a HUGE amount of responsibility and maturity, which Trump has failed to show according to this article. The article shows the audience that Trump has major behavioral problems and America should think twice before they decide to vote for him.  If Trump fails to handle a few court cases seriously and maturely, how will he handle having an entire country in the palm of his hand? Trump is clearly incapable of running an entire country.

The article about Trump's harsh comments towards immigrants was the one that caught my attention the most. It's incredible to see how people judge a huge group of people just because of the mistakes others had done. This doesn't necessarily mean that everyone one is the same. And who is he to judge we are all immigrants believe it or not even if we were born here our past relatives came here for a better life, for better opportunities. And if it weren't for immigrants we wouldn't be called the country of diversities or of opportunities. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/nyregion/trumps-instinct-for-racially-charged-rhetoric-before-his-presidential-bid.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/nyregion/trumps-instinct-for-racially-charged-rhetoric-before-his-presidential-bid.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/nyregion/trumps-instinct-for-racially-...</a>®ion=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news

Kurt says "My personal prediction/forecast: the scientists will lose. History teaches us this. Ideology trumps reason. Such is human nature. Watch your backside."<br/><br/>Wow kurt: you come right out and say it -- ideology trumps reason, scientists will lose.<br/><br/>And of course you and your ideology will win.  <br/><br/>This is particularly funny given the way things are going right now, fella.

Why in the world would we think we need to train anyone to fight? Human's fighting instinct trumps eating and sex combined. Let them work out their military tactics on their own.

Are you saying that American voters are the real suckers for electing politicians who prevent them from buying their drugs on the Australian markets?<br/><br/>You write: "I have looked into the charges against big pharma, and most of them are completely trumped up." <br/><br/>What about the trade barriers facing Americans who would like to buy drugs on Australian markets? These barriers were created by big pharma. Trumped up?

626
I believe Pell grants are not limited.  Thus there are often annual shortfalls that these are retroactively funded in future authorizations.<br/><br/>We spend lots on prisoners, and so, since the president's experiment is legal as you suggest, let's see if this works.  Odd to that you trumpet the 1994 law.  The original Pell grants were able to be used by prisoners.  The 1994 law turns out to have only bad results.  Let's stop being stupid on this subject.

627
The best line in the piece is:<br/>"Human beings are majestic creatures, too."<br/><br/>That one line summarizes the root core of many of the world's problems.  Societies have always made value judgements concerning the relative value of people's lives.  Some are worth more than others.  This is the motivation for prejudice and racism that flows around the world.  The Arab world is rife with it.  Slavery was founded upon it.  (Do not forget that slavery existed before the time of the ancient Greeks.)<br/><br/>Supply side, job creator economics applies it.  Mass incarcerations enforce it.  Jailing the mentally ill promotes it.  Victim blaming is powered by it.  Celebrity worship grows out of it.  Politics is full of it.  <br/><br/>This must be a common failing of human society.  We most certainly value some over others and always have.<br/><br/>"All men are created equal" looks great on paper but is rarely practiced.  We like to blame people for their current situations.  We use trumped up morality plays to justify our prejudices.  If we could figure out a way to apply that "reasoning" to wild animals, we wouldn't be so upset at the killing of Cecil the lion.  We would just say that it was his fault for leaving the preserve  He should have known better.  Or the ever popular, that's just the way those creatures (people) are.  

628
Very few countries in the world acknowledge basic human rights including the US at times.  Power it seems beyond rhetoric which the powerful use adroitly trumps the rights of people.<br/><br/>When the powerful are afraid of losing their grip as in China they usually double down on brutal tactics to regain it.  This is especially so when the government there can no longer live up to its economic bargain with its people to give them prosperity.  The Chinese powers that be hoped after the Tianemen Square uprisings that they could exchange political freedom for economic prosperity.  Now that this is failing they are falling back on their old methods which includes denying legal justice.<br/><br/>There are plenty of signs especially their construction of an artificial  Island in the South China Sea in others territory that this belligerency is about to be extended to their neighbors.    We need a firm hand when confronting these issues and should not plunge in like a bull in a China Shop. Sorry.  China can still be our partner, but as they crack down we still need to let them know strongly that human rights is a bed rock issue for us.

629
Its amused to see how an upset way liberals saw this event . To be practical, if Chinese government wants snow , they can make snows far more than enough. In china the high speed rail is so fast that from Peking to Shanghai it took two hours . They might not need to do it but they can easily build an express way from Peking to northeast cities where there is ambient snow.<br/>And human rights, yes, what I saw is train trails, electricity and internet were build in an rural place where productivity were used to be  based on farm slaves a hundred year ago.<br/>Librals at home they cannot stop Donald trump internationally they cannot boycott China .it's just amusing.

I have not talked to anybody who actually likes him.  All my liberal friends, and even my conservatives friends don't like him, and now Mexico hates him too.

I am not a dem, but I believe Joe Biden is an honest and trust worthy man and<br/>in the end would be much less devise than Hilary the liar.  Dems do you real<br/>want the Clinton all over again.  Bill is senile -- have you seen his actions- he is<br/>acting very old and stumbles in his words.  Bernie and the rest of the farm are<br/>not electable, but Joe would add a new dimension to the slugfest . I believe that<br/>trump is the category 5 storm for the talking heads, political pundits , candidates and old print media (like the NYT).  Everybody is worried on both<br/>sides and I believe that that is health for our political system .  Hilary has<br/>big issues with the email scandal and Benghazi.  Most liberal will not agree<br/>but in reality that is the truth

632
The right wing has gone over to a belief system where ideology trumps reality.  If the Earth keeps getting warmer due to human activities, despite what the oil companys' propaganda outlets spout - the Earth is wrong.  If Kansas is not seeing an economic boom after cutting taxes, and is running a budget deficit - the numbers are wrong.  And, of course, if Weimar-level inflation does not appear despite the Fed's expansionary policies, the inflation numbers are wrong.<br/><br/>Anyone pointing out the disconnect between the Republican's ideology-based predictions and reality is a heretic.  It's sinful to listen to heretics, because they might lead people to question their faith-based certainties, and (gasp) stop voting for Republicans until they come to their senses.

633
The woman has been mocked and lampooned by the right-wing for decades and then people are miffed because she seems cautious.  She chooses her words carefully, but then she's called secretive.  The press itself has trumpeted her as the presumptive candidate for two years, but then describes her as "entitled."<br/><br/>She'll never be one of the good old boys, no one will ever describe her as someone they'd like to have a beer with, and Maureen Dowd will never have a good word for her.  But she's smart, tough, experienced, hard-working and a Democrat. That's good enough for me.

634
Joe Biden looks much more confident many other candidates. I'm glad there is finally appeared a candidate who can seriously compete with Hillary. The Republican party is very productive. Two excellent candidate. Do not forget that trump is now also on the leaderboard.

635
Not surprising... remember when the GOP in the senate tried to squelch Obama's nuclear deal with Russia?   The GOP put forth all sorts of nonsensical arguments against it.  It didn't matter to them that Condi Rice, George Schultz, Henry Kissinger and other Republicans thought it was a good deal.  The senate finally ratified the treaty, with help from people like Richard Luger.  And look what happened to him.  Politics trumps almost everything with the modern GOP, sadly.  

636
To quote Miss Mattie Jones of Charlotte, North Carolina, a senior citizen in 1974: "You don't know what you got till you try."<br/><br/>Mr. Vice President, I trust your political instincts more than all the commenters here put together. If you want to run, go right ahead. It can't hurt and you might win. You are an honest man, you care about the poor and middle class, seniors and youth, our military and veterans, and in the experience department, being a two-term vice president trumps being a one-term secretary of state. You've been a great Veep to a very good president, and this time you have name recognition, which you lacked in your previous runs. When people listen to you, they like you. They'd rather have a beer with you than any other candidate of either party.<br/><br/>This personal note from me to you: thank you for nudging President Obama on marriage equality. You made an impact there that LGBTs will always be grateful for.

637
I keep hearing the mantra 'but I don't trust Iran'. That is a disingenuous stance. Any adult knows, or should know, that we don't live in a trustful world. That is why we have enforceable contracts. I don't trust Iran either, but I don't expect them to trust us either. Why should they? It's not like we didn't have a hand in the overthrow of their democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953. (Ironically, it was their purported sworn enemy GW Bush who empowered them by neutralizing Iraq, their great local foe). But this deal has nothing to do with trust. Why would the parties have negotiated so long and so hard were this a 'trusting' arrangement? The deal appears to be a win-win for all sides, as every good deal should be.<br/>The troubling thing about the GOP, in this instance and others, is that their rabid and blind hatred of Obama trumps (no pun intended) their supposed love of country. So while it is understandable to disdain one's political adversary, that orientation should never be maintained when it threatens our country's safety and welfare. The GOP, which is always quick to wrap itself in our flag, shows disdain not for Obama alone, but for the American people as well.

638
Anyone but Clinton. This country can do without a Clinton dynasty.  <br/><br/>The issue with Hill isn't about likeability or personality. It's not an "exaggerated favorability problem." It's an exaggerated "believability" problem. There's an absence of honesty with her that people (at least those who aren't wearing rose-colored glasses) just see right through. She is seen for what she is, an opportunist who consistently speaks with forked tongue; who will say whatever she has to say to get elected (just like Bill.) If she takes a stand it's backed by polls and demographics and strategically advantageous to her (and Bill's) agenda. <br/><br/>There are many of us who are not impressed in the least with Clinton or her "message" (whatever that happens to be at any given moment) and are so tired of the "inevitability" because, despite all the campaign rhetoric, this is one candidate who does not represent the middle class, the working class or has a genuine progressive bone in her body. (Anyone looking for those attributes ought to look elsewhere.)<br/><br/>As for the throngs of Hillary's faithful supporters, fantasy and the "will to believe" continue, as always, to trump facts and inconvenient truths.<br/><br/><a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/12/hillary-clinton-wall-streets-pick-2016/" title="http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/12/hillary-clinton-wall-streets-pick-2016/" target="_blank">http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/12/hillary-clinton-wall-streets-pick-2016/</a><br/><br/><a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/05/40-years-democratic-presidents-talking-much-want-get-money-politics/" title="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/05/40-years-democratic-presidents-talking-much-want-get-money-politics/" target="_blank">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/05/40-years-democratic-presid...</a>

639
I totally agree with you about Bush and Cheney. The damage they did to this country trumps anything Hillary Clinton has been accused of doing, yet the press barely made a whimper of their atrocities. I suppose the so-called Clinton email scandal is much more important than the unnecessary loss of lives in Iraq. 

640
The assumption is that rationality and temper will ultimately "trump" outrageous behavior and boorishness. I don't think so. I'v been reading comments on social media from Trump supporters and they all seem to have such low regard for the integrity and effectiveness of politicians that the manner in which Trump blurts out whatever crosses his mind is refreshingly attractive to them and more important than the message. What is scary is that we've seen this before and it does not end well. Donald can out-Christie Christie and the rest of the pack in ways the others (like Huckabee) can't because he can literally put his money where his mouth is.

641
The situation is a lot simpler than what the pundits would like to have us believe. The far right base has always voted for what is emotionally satisfying. Therefore when they are angry, which they clearly are, the most emotionally satisfying candidate is Trump. At the moment, anger trumps (all pun intended) logic and long-term strategy in the GOP.  

642
This is like the push to cut funding for the IRS because they were targeting PACs from both camps to prevent "non-partison" political advocacy from avoiding paying taxes. The Republican response was to cut funding, decrease tax collections, and increase the deficit. Politics in the right wing trumps common sense. and the common good. Stop voting for people who do not care about our country.

643
the Republican field including Donald Trump and Jeb Bush can not help but put their feet in their mouths considering the need to play to the anti science me first base that they are playing to.  consider Jeb Bush's Romneyesk moment when he claimed that workers should work more hours to make a bigger crust of bread.  Most of the differences between these candidates is in style rather than substance.  That so many  Republicans prefer the blow hard style of Donald trump is not surprising.

644
The culture of guns  trumps  everything else. Officers assume  everybody has a gun under the seat, you see  the careful approach to a vehicle at a simple traffic stop. This is the far west mentality, it's a done deal ,  no going back, millions  and millions of guns everywhere, it's done! Between midnight  and 5am  here in Chicago  there were 10 shootings , ok the  far-midwest. 

645
Lies or truth, justice or injustice, unlike any other 'modern' country, your cops will assume, in 99.9% of encounters, that their 'suspect' is carrying a gun. There  is nothing like the prospect of being shot dead that will play havoc with rational thinking and decision making. Your right to bear arms is at the root of this problem, not rogue cops.<br/><br/>Only when the Second Amendment starts hurting America's finances - perhaps when all tourists choose somewhere safer - will something be done. Protecting profits will trump protecting lives...try living with that afterwards.

646
I’M CALLING OUT JOE BIDEN<br/>Joe Biden may be the great prize.<br/>He is not a man who trumpets his accomplishments but look at his voting record. He alwaysstood front and center for civil rights. If wrong, let me know. He sees and understands that equality must be applied to all men with mutual respect. As Obama’s VP, he spoke of the great honor of serving  a man of impeccable character, POTUS Obama. He seems, in his political role,  to be warmhearted toward all Americans. The American value that Biden carries is that we are here to mutually respect one another in the American spirit of Equality.  Not to do so is un-American; that’s the implication.<br/>THAT’S THE SUBTEXT. Biden is a man of warm and extraordinary character. He is not a half-empty  rah-rah type. He’s the Real McCoy. WE MUST DEMAND THAT HE RUN. There’s no one as good as him for us and for a greater, more inclusive America  supported by the power of the government.<br/>Equality and Mutual Respect are American values. America’s greatness rests upon its citizens’  desire to live in a society where equality and mutual respect among citizens is a daily wonder to behold, a real way of living. This is the spirit of Biden’s America: A more perfect Union that draws all states a little closer together in a nationally united US.<br/>This includes working class and poor whites. We have a decision to make: Do we unite on and on as a great nation,despite our differences, or not. 

647
This isn't really a peace deal about Iran's nuclear ambition but a trade deal that brings Iran back into the fold where China, Russia, and France can have a trading partner without the threat of sanctions hanging over their head.  And having ready access to Iran's oil.  The French and company are pragmatic enough to set aside morality because profit trumps all concerns.

648
If Mr. Purdy thinks that Hillary Clinton deserves so much scrutiny because she is the wife of a former president and is herself a former senator and secretary of state, why don't we see equally critical coverage of Jeb Bush, the brother of one president, son of another, former governor of Florida? How about some reporting on Jeb's role in the 2000 election? Or the Terry Schivo debacle? Or his business ties? Or his involvement with terrorists like Orlando Bosch? These were real scandals, real criminal acts occured, unlike the thousands of fake scandals that the Times has trumpeted over the years about Hillary.<br/><br/>If Hillary deserves extra scrutiny, Jeb most certainly deserves at least as much, if not more.

649
High or Low, it seems doubtful that when the chips are up, a majority of Americans are going to choose Donald as their nominee because they sense they are going to get trumped, and while we may be stupid, we are not crazy.

650
Wishful thinking from Douthat: Jeb is helped by debate with Trump. With the amazing transformation of the Republican Party starting with Reagan we may be in for a big surprise.  Trump is in many ways like Reagan: impulsive, brash, class and minority neanderthal, gender neanderthal, and a bully who appeals to instincts of violence, a sense of audience, acting ability. Trump may trump Bush as Reagan humiliated Bush's father in debate: "I paid for this mic..."<br/>Douthat is too young to remember that Reagan was a notorious "reactionary"and widely considered a phony, unprepared for office with Sarah Palin foreign policy credentials. His administration sold missile technology to Iran to found illegal CIA operations in Nicaragua, a scandal that makes the Benghazi event inconsequential.<br/>Bush may be a pushover for Trump. 

651
Unfortunately, much of what the Donald says I like but also unfortunately he has completely disqualified himself as Commander-in-Chief material by his disgraceful McCain remarks and the disrespect he has shown for all Vets. I don’t speak for all Vets but as a 30 year retiree Vietnam Vet with a CIB that began as a draftee, I’m still pretty well connected with the Military and most everyone I know feel the same as I do.  We feel that if “The Donald” had a little more self respect, he would just come clean about his Draft Dodging and confess he was just a coward and did everything short of maiming himself (didn’t have the guts) to avoid military service and danger rather than spinning yarns Ripley wouldn’t believe about “bone spurs but can’t remember where?”  Hence, using “Guts” to describe Trump would be a gross misnomer.  Bill Clinton is still excoriated as a Draft Dodger, isn’t “The Donald” every bit as worthy of the title?<br/><br/>If “The Donald” was not fit to serve when his Country needed him during Vietnam, what makes him fit to serve now?  If you want to know how I really feel, check out my Blog article at: <a href="http://old-soldier-colonel.blogspot.com/2015/07/does-draft-dodging-trump-trumps.html" title="http://old-soldier-colonel.blogspot.com/2015/07/does-draft-dodging-trump-trumps.html" target="_blank">http://old-soldier-colonel.blogspot.com/2015/07/does-draft-dodging-trump...</a> 

652
Does anyone really beleive that Biden can trump Hillary?<br/>Never seen so many comments from nyt readers.  The press  and  the rest of the media will cash in on the election by bashing the candidates.  Bring them onstage and  smear them with whatever sells to whoever pays.   It's certainly entertaining.   Don't forget we elected George W. Bush twice.

653
The Times's coverage of presidential candidates if so unrelentingly negative, and so skewed to scandals, gaffes, and the horse race, that almost *nothing* is said about substantive issues and the positive aspects of a candidate's message don't get out.<br/><br/>Furthermore, while some may object to the excessive attention devoted to Mrs. Clinton's lapses (just look at the Republicans, most of whom make Clinton look like Mother Theresa, but who apart from trump get very little negative attention), it's also true that she gets positive coverage the someone like Bernie Sanders doesn't get. Indeed, the coverage of Sanders has been more slanted than the coverage of Clinton -- if he attracts 100,000 people to meetings, the thrust of the article will be "Sanders attracts liberals but gets no support from anyone else." This, too, is biased reporting.<br/><br/>Frankly, the Times does not have a good record with campaign coverage. Often, reporters attempt to create false equivalency between liberals and conservatives. Consider the articles on Al Gore's supposed honesty problem -- a classic Rove smear, designed to hit the oppositino candidate where he is -- strongest -- when Gore was in fact one of the most honest candidates ever to seek the presidency, and his opponent, George W. Bush ran the most dishonest administration in living memory.<br/><br/>As to Bill Clinton, he was pilloried until Newt Gingrich came along. After that, he could do no wrong.<br/><br/>The Times really has to re-examine its political coverage.

654
The GOP primary voting process should include a secondary vote recommending Jeb's being sent to represent the Democrats instead, since he is the closest thing to Hillary since Wed Hubbell. <br/><br/>People on both sides are shaking their earlier assumptions that Donald's candle will burn out like all candles lit from both ends. After the fatal assumptions in 2008 that any prominent political figure could handle the responsibilities of the Presidency, you'd think political assumptions would have become an oxymoron.<br/><br/>But will Trump the Trumpet's campaign die from conservatives finally READING his history of liberal ejaculations like Jeb-style climate change flackery? Will Donald be trumped by his own verbal diarrheas of the past? 

655
My degree's in sociology, giving me enough science background to realize the climate science community's science is, well...science. And the massive countermovement, led &amp; funded by the fossil fuel industry &amp; Libertarian 0.1%ers...is not. <br/><br/>And sociologically, denialism is a widespread phenomenon, subscribed to by 3/4 of Republican voters, making it a matter of sociology, not psychology. <br/><br/>Sure it's led by Big Oil. But few of those GOP voters are denying science to help Big Oil. Many comments on comment threads come from paid trolls, whose motives are simple enough. But others are representative of those millions of right wing rank &amp; file Republicans. <br/><br/>What's in it for them? History helps explain that.<br/><br/>This article &amp; comment thread demonstrate abundant examples of contemporary denialism, but on the process level it's no different than Ptolomy's denialism, several millenia ago. <br/><br/>Ptolomy was an ancient Greek astronomer who achieved amazing levels of precision in his measurements, despite his primitive tools. But one thing boggled him: the Wandering Stars (what we know now are planets) would periodically move backwards in the sky. <br/><br/>Impossible! God's Heavens had to be perfect, hence round, with all moving around Earth in an orderly manner.<br/><br/>Today we find his solution laughable. He said the Wandering Stars moved in elaborae epicycles. Because his ideology trumped observation.<br/><br/>Likewise the increasingly elaborate mental gymnastics of today's ideology-driven denialists.

656
A vote for trump is a wasted vote. Considering his lack of knowledge regarding policy, his clear lack of gravitas, and his ego driven pronouncements of his wealth will ultimately turn off supporters. Suggesting Trump could represent our county on the global scale as our President is ludicrous and absurd. Can you imagine him like an 8th grader telling a world leader, "I'm richer than you and you're a horrible person!" He needs to go back to reality TV.

657
It is comical watching an old guard Republican elitist like Douthat run scared. It wasn't very long ago he was trying to convince us of the bonafides of Marco Rubio and even Chris Christie. Now that showman Trump is upstaging everyone including one of his fellow old guard, old money elites like Bush he is in panic mode. Well Russ you and your party played a trump card (pun intended) when Rove pandered to the tea party FOX crowd to win an election and put our congress into decision paralysis. Boehner is still trying to clean his  shorts. Now your bargain with the devil has come to haunt you. I hope Trump kicks Jeb's gold plated butt.

658
You are sliding over the source of trump's appeal and the nature of those to whom he appeals. He is pure unbridled GOP id: coherence, even rationality are not wanted here, not by the TPer's who shout "keep your government hands off my Medicare" . He is a megaphone for their rage, a voice braying what they believe and resonating with what the feel.  They are the people who have been roiled and agitated by the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Mark levin, Michael Savage, MIchelle Malkin, Ann Coulter. (I suggest that readers who are used the rather decorous tone of the NYT comment threads take a short visit to, say, Free State or the comments on AOL. This will give you an idea of what is going on underneath the covers --- and be prepared --- it is really ugly.) <br/><br/>I note that in response to the revelation of the noxious Facebook ravings of his honcho Sam Nunberg (who managed to call Obama a Marxist, Fascist, and islamist --- among other things ---in one sentence) he (Trump) is making more typical politician noises about disavowing his flunky's spoutings. I am guessing that this will cost him support among his raw-meat craving fans and that he will either have to return to his race-baiting and outrageous "honesty" or fade. I don't believe his metastatized ego will aloow him to do that.  

659
Wow.  Dr. Lewinski makes my blood run cold, not only because of his one-sided, prejudicial view that a cop's life is more important and valuable than any one else's - innocent, guilty, unarmed, homeless, handicapped or otherwise, but also because he makes a living defending the brutality and/or deaths of citizens at the hands of police, warranted or otherwise, without having borne witness, first hand, to any of the incidents.  And then he testifies to it in a court of law?    Talk about depraved indifference to life.  <br/><br/>So the handicapped kid in the wheelchair in a police station that was beaten and dumped out of his chair, kicked and tazed by two police officers and laughed at by another that I watched on a police department video a couple of months ago, had no civil rights at all, and the police were entirely justified because they could say that their lives were at risk?  And we're worried about ISIS?<br/><br/>If this is really where we are in America - that the police have full authority at any time, that whatever they say, whether truthful or not, and worse, whatever they decide to do, alone or in a gang, trumps anyone else's civil rights, then no citizen is safe and we are a police state, subject to the sadistic, abusive whims of any and all police officers.  This is what the Waffen-SS did in Germany.  <br/><br/>This is legalized terrorism.  America's own growing holocaust.  <br/><br/>We're here.  Horrifying.

660
It's war!  Republicans are actually preparing for warfare with Donald Trump; not debate.  And it can all be boiled down to a scattered running-for-their political-lives army of 15 v a focused arrogantly self-confident army of one.<br/><br/>Their ammunition?  "Stagecraft."  Canned policy and practiced come backs.   Ugh! All without as much as a nod to substance, honesty, inspiration, creativity, the good of the country, or policy specifics.<br/><br/>Don't they yet understand that planning, practice, preparation, and stomach turning pandering won't serve them in this particular war.  Why?  Because Trump plays by his own rules.  And those rules and tactics are more guerrilla warfare than conventional eye-rolling strategy.  <br/><br/>Wikipedia defines guerrilla warfare in this way: "Tactically, the guerrilla army makes massive repetitive attacks far from the opponent's center of gravity with a view to keeping its own casualties to a minimum and imposing a constant debilitating strain on the enemy."  That's Trump!  And that's Trump's trump-card.  And he smugly knows it.  Also, guerrilla warfare, by it's unpredictable nature, is resistant to defeat.<br/><br/>It's doubtful that anyone has seen anything before like this.  And while shocking and dizzying it might even be called brilliant.  In addition, we do love novelty and shiny trinkets.  We're also attracted to honesty--even when somewhat flawed.  And especially when there's been a long dry spell that's made it hard to otherwise find.

661
The other day CNN did an interview with Mr trump, I watched it (It was a linked to a web site, I don't watch the boob tube anymore) to see what all the fuss was about. What I saw with Mr. Trump's performance, was just that a performance. This billionaire who obviously intelligent, did not have any answer to illegal immigration issues, than to "build a fence". When building a fence is your only answer to immigration challenges, you are nothing but a stuffed shirt, a prop. It is also interesting to see how the media hands off his every word, if this guy was really serious, especially about immigration, they would avoid him like they did Ron Paul.  We are being played, yet again. 

662
"And Now, What Mexico Thinks of Donald Trump"<br/><br/>This topic interested me because, I was interested to see what people think about Donald Trump after the racial slurs he recently stated. Although Donald trump is rich and famous he had no right to stereotype Mexicans and say that they all are drug dealing, crime bringing rapist. If Trump wins this election I would be very shocked and upset. Most people I talked to didnt like Trump to begin with, they all thought he was just doing it for publicity... Again, and they definitely do not like him anymore now.

In this article, Trump degrades the Mexican people as a whole. Donald truly does speak in stereotypes, stating that the Mexicans are just holding back the United States from greatness. He calls them rapists and job stealers and I do not think it is fair for him to say that. Although in some cases, he is right but you cannot blame a whole country for a few peoples wrong-doings. The only reason why he can publicly state his opinions is because of is economical stance. Just because he has money, he believes he can say whatever he wants, and get away with it. When El Chapo escaped prison, and placed a 1 million dollar bounty on Trump (dead or alive), Trump suddenly changes his opinion saying that he "loves" the Mexican people and their spirit. But because of his two-faced actions, he will grow notorious in Mexico.

Thank you for reiterating what we already know. The Republicans do not want another victory for Obama. An Iran deal added to his already formidable list of accomplishments would cement Obamas' legacy. Instead of just a great legacy it would become an amazing legacy. Saving the US auto industry, pulling us out of a near depression, healthcare for the masses, reopening relations with Cuba, the Iran Deal and much more. These are no small accomplishments. They will be remembered throughout history while the trumped up charges of death panels, fake birth certificates, Obama leading the Israelis to the door of the ovens or being the leading sponsor of terror will become footnotes showing those who said those things were petty insignificant players who used lies to attempt to bring down the first African American POTUS.

Trump is too undiciplined to study. This is the same man who is going to replace Obamacare with "something terrific" and send 11m illegals back, without any plan, beyond allowing back "the good ones".<br/><br/>He's not that bright, as anyone witnessed first hand when he engaged in a Twitter war with the writer of Modern Family and was summarily "trumped" from A to Z. <br/><br/>He exemplifies fluff over substance...even the insults he hurls lack creativity "stupid, disgusting". I'm fairly certain any kid could outsmart him in an insult contest.<br/><br/>He offers us bravado borne of narcissim, aggressiveness born of stupidity and arrogance inflated by a lifetime of successfully bullying others . He is A half formed boy-man who thinks the "art of the deal" can be reduced to who shouts the loudest, pushes the hardest and bares the most teeth. It may work, sometimes, in the seedy underbelly of the NYC real estate market, but in academia or in politics, he is easily seen for what he is: a not-particularly-bright transparent narcissist.<br/><br/>In real life, Trump has gotten by leveraging money he never earned in a very linear game of "sell and buy." Without his handlers and without a playbook, he will be lost during the debate and his humiliation will be colossal. Not that he will ever understand that: his narcisssism will never let through the depth of how poorly he will be judged get through.....<br/><br/>The emperor with no clothes will be forced to look in a mirror. 

666
Trump's hackneyed, imperious bravado has nourished a long-standing love/hate relationship with the American public. It's either our baleful preoccupation with money and riches, or our hypocritical blood-lust for exemplifying social inequity; in either case it amounts to his enduring popularity--one that, I'm afraid, will almost always trump policy issues in the collective American mind.<br/>No matter what comes of the debate, I see Trump coming up roses. All he needs to worry about is maintaining status quo. We expect him to offend us--that's why we adore him. But, if by some miraculous development he should sprout a sense for legitimate political campaigning, I think he will garner a new found respect from his opponents, and surely from his supporters. While I don't see that Trump has a real shot at the Oval Office, and I think he knows that well, he most certainly will cause much more disarray amongst the true GOP candidates. In the very least, his presence is forcing them to focus more on genuine issues than mudslinging derision. For that I say, thank you Mr. Trump

It's hilarious - Republicans trying to handle the monster they created. Trump is their 2-year-old, and everybody knows that 2-year-olds can make fools of anybody. Trump is already succeeding at that, and now he's got a chance to do it in person. Can they stop him from pelting them with Cheerios? If only he would stick his finger in an electric socket! (But Donald would like it! He'd stick his finger in the socket with one hand and grab hold of Jeb with the other. Jeb, who is so not, like, electrifying.)<br/><br/>Trump's only problem is going to be the time constraints - he can't say anything coherent in a couple of minutes. Come to think of it, he can't say anything coherent in a couple of hours. (Take the challenge of diagramming his "sentence" about the Iran nuclear treaty on Slate, then take a Xanax: <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2015/07/31/donald_trump_this_run_on_sentence_from_a_speech_in_sun_city_south_carolina.html)" title="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2015/07/31/donald_trump_this_run_on_sentence_from_a_speech_in_sun_city_south_carolina.html)" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2015/07/31/donald_trump_this_r...</a> <br/><br/>But his choleric vocalizing just makes him more like normal Republicans - not that there's anything normal about Republicans these days. This article paints a truly mad portrait of Republican politics today, a very scary portrait considering that any one of these nimnos could become president.

The US military's chance discovery of the world's largest lithium deposits --- the stuff which powers promising American hybrid car and solar battery applications --- has little material benefit on the native peoples of Afghanistan, who acquire no share of the bounty.<br/><br/>The situation is not at all unlike the civil unrest which engulfed the streets of Baltimore earlier in 2015.  There the equation reaches back 50 years: no education, no job, no housing and no political power equals no hope.<br/><br/>So long as global capitalism is incentivized (some say corrupted) to benefit a privileged few (i.e. - the man behind the curtain) instead of cooperatively aligned to lift the masses, we get what we get.<br/><br/>When it comes to democracy and self determination, so long as property rights continue to trump human welfare, do black lives --- or those of the people of Afghanistan --- matter?<br/><br/><a href="http://lifeamongtheordinary.blogspot.com/2015/04/democracy-and-self-determination.html" title="http://lifeamongtheordinary.blogspot.com/2015/04/democracy-and-self-determination.html" target="_blank">http://lifeamongtheordinary.blogspot.com/2015/04/democracy-and-self-dete...</a>

i almost never watch debates. but it could be fun to watch trump flaming everyone else. who will pour oil on the flames and who will be the firefighter? maybe trump will prove the rest are all really just apprentices when it comes to handling the media and get them all fired.

But there is also another side to this, Trump speaks what others dare to say. He mocks other republicans and democrats on their choices and mistakes. In one case he revealed Lindsey Graham's phone number in a speech! I think that Trump is witty and a very competitive candidate. Some things he has done have caused him to make foes like for example when he mocked Mexicans by saying that people coming illegally to America from Mexico is a huge problem. Well Trump, what do you expect, shove them into a box and deport them back to Mexico? The fact is that deporting them will cause a major economy crisis. There are over 10 million unemployed in America, and sending undocumented and illegals back won't just cause these unemployed Americans to take over their jobs. Sure some bring crime, and even rapists. Other points Trump has made are controversial such as how USA left 2,300 Humvees back in Iraq after the war that cost us 2 trillion. And left over thousand wounded soldiers back in there. Because his logic states that the equipment and supplies left in the Middle East is going to make ISIS stronger and rich. So rich, in fact, Trump is going to trade with the ISIS and charge them on Tariffs!

I guarantee the majority Muslim Malaysians who hear of this report will respond by saying the NY Times is making it all up to make Malaysia look bad. That's exactly what they're saying about the Wall Street Journal expose of the Malaysian Prime Minister's financial scandal. Truth has never mattered in Malaysia, only image. Their international image is tarnished, to say the least, after their deadly incompetent management of the government-owned airline, and a second conviction and imprisonment of an opposition leader for the same crime (a trumped-up sodomy charge) but never mind--it's all foreign lies. I lived in Kuala Lumpur in the late 1980s under Mahathir's rule.  Nothing has changed, nor do I reasonably expect change any time in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the Malay Muslim government has become even more fascist as the years go by.

673
You must not read the New York Times every day, because I've read a whole bunch of articles about Trump.  Many of which are unflattering.  (Actually, any truthful article about the man is inherently "negative".)  They are all listed here:<br/><br/><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/donald_j_trump/index.html?8qa" title="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/donald_j_trump/index.html?8qa" target="_blank">http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/donald_j_tr...</a><br/><br/>Really, do you people know that you can do searches on the New York Times?

These are the issues that should elicit a response from the world governments. But time and time again, the issues of corporations and politics trump crises of the world's most marginalised people. When history looks upon us, will we say we stood against evil, or will we watch another tragedy pass us by. <br/><br/>History will not judge us kindly for letting yet another genocide come and go without lifting a finger to stop it. When will humanity learn?

As an American, I hesitate to dispense advice about how the U.K. operates its political system.  But I am confident the U.S. would be better off were we to adopt some British conventions to our own means of selecting a President.<br/><br/>Every four years, Americans watch an over-funded pageant of contenders vie for attention from media corporations.  Almost always, the candidate who spends the most wins the contest.  Far more citizens cast ballots in this charade than for congress or their state legislators.<br/><br/>But if elected members of the House of Representatives chose the President, voters would pay serious attention to whom they send to Congress.  Also, we would virtually eliminate political gridlock.  If citizens dislike the results, they can send someone else to Congress two years later. <br/><br/>This will never happen in the U.S., because money trumps rationality in politics.  But we can at least appreciate that the British do representative democracy better than we do.

676
I'm not sure why Appalachia was trumpeted in the headline (which presumably Mr. Krugman didn't write), only to receive such glancing attention.<br/><br/>Appalachia is not, like either Puerto Rico or Greece, a political unit with a government. It's just a region that shares geographical and vaguely some cultural traits, and certain areas have been far more coal-dependent than others. Can there be such a thing as "Appalachian policy"? West Virginia isn't in the same boat with the Appalachian east of North Carolina or Virginia, because they don't share the same state government to set course.

.<br/>@ Steve:<br/><br/>I apologize for the delay/non-response.  In terms of The Times, I was distracted by a little matter of an Editors' Note and frankly lost interest in the Selfie Expert.  But I do like to be a man of my word.<br/><br/>I determined what was "misinformation" and what was "accurate" based upon my own understanding of what constitutes a "self" and a "selfie".  Caveat:  The guy's every remark on the topic had a tongue-in-cheek tone; my "review" was meant to be in a light vein as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't think a migrating trumpeter swan can take a "selfie", because a bird does not have self-knowledge w/r/t operation of cameras and the like.  Also, there is something of a haphazard element, because the trumpeter swan grabbed the camera off of a 300-foot selfie stick and somehow took a photo of itself.  This to me is not a selfie.  So I think that part was "misinformation".<br/><br/>On the other hand, Selfie Expert says that a photo of a Millennial is not a selfie.  That is "accurate" (as long as the photographer and the subject are different people).  Same with the photo of a slice of pizza: Not a selfie.  The guy gets that right too.<br/><br/>Steve, I admire the element of your Comments that involves giving sources for your statements.  In this instance, I am not meeting the standard you set.  But I hope we can continue to learn from one another's commentary.

678
@AACNY<br/>In part that's because most Americans consider Obama to be a fairly good president; judging from his two terms in spite of GOP demonizing, at least as good as GWB.<br/><br/>Further, there's a complete dismissal/denial, by the 'reactionary Right', of the positive consequences (for the West) of an insular, unpopular, theocracy being forced to deal with the cacophonous and self-interested engagement with the 'infidel capitalists'.  China very nearly lost control of its nation 15 years after Nixon's opening of China.  And economically they're Communist in name only.  It should be considered an unqualified success if this deal provides even half the difficulties for the mullahs that global capitalism did for the Chinese politburo.<br/><br/>Capitalism's inevitability, which the Right otherwise so loves to trumpet, can't be both inevitable and negligible.  At the very least this deal buys us time instead of war.  And it's non-codified implications may yet bring about change in Iran from within.

679
It doesn't matter to the republicans what the majority of the American people think. All that matters is what the trumpeting base thinks. It doesn't matter that the embargo has been an abysmal failure for the last 53 years. It doesn't matter that other nations are moving in, investing, and gaining a foothold in Cuba while American businesses are forced to watch,sidelined, unable to compete or enter the market.<br/><br/>This is what the GOP does. Double down on failed policies, refuse to admit that their policies don't work, and to vehemently resist any change to policies that don't work, have never worked, ad will never work. Hopeless and changeless . . .

We've allowed the punishment to far exceed the crime and has now turned the ripple effects of the resulting punishment to the offender (Job loss, housing problems, financial insecurity) to be more harmful that the original crime itself. <br/><br/>However, we are ignoring the real reason this exists. <br/><br/>The prison system has expanded to the point that every citizen is not considered free by their own volition but rather free because we haven't run into the law yet.<br/><br/>When an officer can indiscriminately take a law abiding citizen off the street with trumped up charges, to stand in front of a judge with no regard to humanity, to sit in a prison that was built to dull emotions and remove our spirit, we cannot be shocked that the result is a human devoid of confidence in their fellow man and a hatred to lash back at a system that doesn't care.<br/><br/>White. Black. Hispanic. Asian.  - it doesn't matter. If you are poor and able to be targeted, the system will get you.<br/><br/>The judicial branch of this country needs an overhaul.

Let's not jump on Europe too quickly. We also took in a family that we sheltered, taught and gave scholarship to. The repayment was grand larceny, drug dealing and finally a radicalized Muslim duo of brothers that are suspected of juddering three people months before they blew up a marathon.<br/>Europe has many examples as well; London buses; Spanish trains; Dutch fill makers; French cartoonists and French Jewish markets.<br/>100 years ago in the USA, people lived in ghettos and each tried to claw their way up the ladder. But they also assimilated. They appreciated America because they could believe what they wanted. However, America was never a place to do what you wanted. If your faith values honor killings, we call it murder and you go to prison. If you want to have your own religious court, so be it. But the courts of the USA trump yours. The bargain is that you can live freely in our country but you have to follow our laws.<br/>China does a ton of business in Africa, why don't they take them? How about Russia taking in the Syrians? They have been backing that butcher. Or how about Saudia Arabia who actually unleashed this violent form of radicalism on the world. Or Pakistan? They're Muslim, same with Indonesia. Oh, that's right they won't take them. So, Europe is now to blame?<br/>Or better yet, how about we cut all foreign aid to every country until they make changes for their people to stay.

THE FUTURE IS NOW . . . <br/><br/>Given the atomic and hydrogen bombs and their proliferation around the world ... and the acceleration of global warming and its many implications ... and add to that the fact that the fall from grace that is part of the human condition and As Darwin said, the aggressive trump the peacemakers,<br/><br/>The meek will inherit death.<br/><br/>I would be quite surprised if human life will exist in even 10 years. As an example, just check out the many apocoliptic themed presentations which are being distributed by the movie and television industries.  <br/><br/>They present themes that resonate as we wait for the many bombs to be unleased in many manifestations.

@Coolhunter<br/>Sorry, but "unborn" is a word unknown to science or medicine. It is a word better restricted to theology, where the concepts of "soul" and salvation trump science. It is the neologism of "pro-lifers" who care little about what happens to children after birth. If you shout "murder" at legal or medically necessary abortions, and/or if you vote down all legislation for schools, housing, equal pay, medical care or anything else to support women and children, please stay out of the discussion.<br/><br/>At 4 weeks gestation (when many women may not know they are pregnant) the developing cells in her uterus are called an embryo. These cells are not viable, and many women miscarry thinking they are menstruating. At 8 weeks, the fetal period begins: the foetus is now 1 and a half inches long. It is NOT viable. It isn't a child you can hold in your arms or take for a walk in a baby carriage. At 12 weeks, the foetus is about 3 inches long. It is still not viable. The current age of viability in the US is 24 weeks, but at that stage, mortality is 45%, and the chance of a normal survivor (without severe handicaps) is only 50%.  <br/><br/>Physicians face serious ethical and moral questions when employing heroic procedures to save such infants (almost all of whom would have died half a century ago), since handicaps such as cerebral palsy, brain and lung damage and other life-crushing conditions may doom these preemies to severely restricted, pain-filled lives.

I must be missing something.  This is a human being, not a pawn in a political drama.  If he isn't under indictment, if the Chinese government can't demonstrate that it has a legitimate reason for the U.S. to ship him back to China (avoiding embarrassment of the ruling elite doesn't qualify) why would we even consider sending him back?  Despite the irony of the Snowden case (again, an issue of embarrassingly bad governmental  behavior) the people of the United States shouldn't sanction political convenience trumping human rights.

Situations like the these are not uncommon in America's under paid working family districts. Judge Gordon, in her role as justice administrator seems viciously inclined, irresponsible in her determination to make Ms. Hall's life a purgatory of unreasonable demands, and she apparently has the unregulated power to do it. Mrs. Hall lost her jobs, two jobs, as an underpaid aid, should be 15.00 per hour per each of her positions anyway, sure that she didn't receive anything close to a living wage in either of the caregiving positions, back breaking, emotionally draining work. She went to Jail while attempting to explain and show up for this out of control judge. This entire experience, set up by Judge Gordon, consisted of uncaring acts contrived to lower Mrs. Holmes self esteem as a productive member of society, acts that might have sucked Mrs. Hall into an undeniably growing vacuum of psychological and financial poverty too often seen when witnessing the American legal system in unbalanced process, Would one of Judge Gordon's peers received her ongoing judicial abuse, a sports star, a celebrity, a senator, a ceo, trump maybe? No. Yet, Mrs. Holmes stood strong through it all, bless her, she and her family. None of this would have happened in a truly democratic, civilized country. Judge Gordon would not have gotten by with this abuse if there had been consequences equal to her bitter reactions to first offender, Mrs. Hall, not if our laws were indeed, based on, " Justice for All."

Which is why proving that Trump is himself a "moron" and a "loser" is the most effective way for the Republican Party to rid itself of this cancer. Because the case can be made that Trump is a lousy businessman. Passive investment of his inheritance would have netted between four to fourteen billion dollars more than his business operations. Hit Trump where he thinks he lives--as a transactional savant--and prove that monkeys throwing darts at a list of stocks could outperform trump over his almost 50-year career. Americans will never back a "LOSER!"

No one even is pointing out the outrageous lies!<br/>Where is even the basic fact checking or follow up questions?  When Ben Carson was asked flat out if the Bible trumped (no pun) the Constitution, he waffled and said something about individual cases and passages.  There was no follow up question along the lines of "Can you give me an example of when the Bible would overrule the Constitution?"

He's the manuchurian candidate in the reality TV age.  He's not a plant, though, he's just pure entertainment.  Though I'm a democrat, I have to say that on one level I am enjoying seeing him make a mockery of the whole political / media circus.  It's a graduate level class in marketing and media manipulation that plays into the weaknesses of the 24/7 media machine.  At this point, the relationship between trump and the media is symbiotic.  They need each other.<br/><br/>The rest of what Mr. Brooks says about the frustrated american public is probably true.  As long as the SS and medicare payments keep coming, no one really cares what they politicians do.  Obama can have his wars on ISIS and Yemen and every where else without interference.  The Corporate elites and Wall St. can continue to loot and pillage at will.  <br/><br/>And we all get to laugh at trump's stand up routine.  <br/><br/>Win win!

Don't trump Bernie!<br/>Bernie issues are opposed<br/>to those of the rich.<br/>Bernie Sanders wants to breathe<br/>life back into our ever dwindling middle class.<br/>One of the ways of doing this is taxing the rich – For instance,<br/>He proposes a federal sales tax on stock trades<br/>and other financial transactions.<br/>Bernie Sanders has stated that many of our societal ills<br/>are borne out of “an economic<br/>system in which the rich controls,<br/>to a large degree, the political and<br/>economic life of the country.”<br/>That 1990 statement rings true, much louder, today.

A lot of syllables to blur the ugly truth about the monster you have helped nurture.<br/><br/>Donald Trump is the logical consequence of overt appeal to indulgent id and ignorance that the conservative movement has been surfing for decades, aided by the wave machine of Fox and their shock radio friends, and all this in that artificial television universe that combines politics and celebrity (machine gun bacon ?)<br/><br/>The 'both sides' sleight of argument comparing Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders ignores the real issues of the fixed game that has given rise to our present inequity and thus Bernie Sanders' appeal. Donald Trump cares about such matters in the same way that he cared about President Obama's birth certificate -- for show and to catch the ear of the monster which the Republican party has nurtured (e.g. Scott Walker can't admit that Obama is a Christian and Benghazi is Watergate, and Iran is Auschwitz, and there is no climate change, and the Bible trumps (!?) evolution ...  ad nauseum). <br/><br/>If you live by appeals to the worst you die by them. Too bad the fever has affected all of us in the body politic.

Maybe it's payback time.  Trump talks about politicians, especially the president, the way elites have always talked about large swaths of Americans, especially in red states:  With complete contempt.  Trump is the one calling them "stupid" now.<br/><br/>Trump's controversial language is what people hold against him, yet it's his main selling point.  That and the fact that he isn't intimidated by the press, the elite enabler.<br/><br/>Peggy Noonan captures his appeal quite well.*  She said one thing they like is his patriotism.  Trump repeatedly says this is a great country, albeit run by fools, that can become great again.  <br/><br/>Think about it.  Americans who feel alienated from the political class -- and deeply love our country -- have to turn to someone like Trump to be heard and make themselves heard.  More importantly, he doesn't insult them for feeling this way about our country!<br/><br/>If this isn't a wake up call, I don't know what is. <br/><br/>*****<br/>*"What Voters See in Donald Trump", WSJ, Peggy Noonan, 7/31/15.<br/><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-voters-see-in-donald-trump-1438301641" title="http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-voters-see-in-donald-trump-1438301641" target="_blank">http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-voters-see-in-donald-trump-1438301641</a>

Psychologically, this summer's love fest for Donald trump represents a collective transference in which a significant sector of the population adores him blindly as if they are infants and he is their father.  Inevitably, there will be a counter-transference during which the majority will reactive negatively, like teenagers yearning to separate from his verbally abusive manner.  Wait for it.

The hard work buttressing climate change, economic growth, income distribution, gun control, providing medical services to the poor and foreign policy are arcane and complicated and just too difficult to sit down and understand unless you're one of those suspicious types who have the time and interest to read books and papers and maybe the NY Times.   Much of the nation seems afflicted by A.D.D.  and 'know-nothingness'.   No need really to look to Walter Lippmann (a suspicious type) for answers.  The inimitable H.L. Mencken observed many many years ago that "... for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong".  And with the support of hundreds of millions of dollars of rich folks' money, irresponsible civic, religious and political leaders and a complicit press that prefers titillating sound bites to hardnosed analysis  "clear" and "simple" trump "wrong"....

Global warming / Climate Change still hotly debated in Scientific circles.<br/><br/>If in fact an issue ... How will China, India and Africa contribute to lessening the problem???... They will be the major contributors to the ' problem'<br/><br/>Since most Socislist countries seem to be the main proponents of Climate Change problems that allows them to add additional taxes within their countries<br/>... Makes one wonder if it is not a trumpeted up problem to extort more monies to support their bloated welfare states... <br/><br/>And I include the U.S. As a Welfare State

" Coupled with the dying throes of ignorant far-right ideology . . . "  Couldn't be farther off the mark.  Liberal wishful thinking.  The Republican far right is stronger than ever.  They control the primary process which means that they determine the profile of Republican candidates.  And that profile reflects their mindset and values.  It is the far right that provides the ideological engine for the current Republican party.  <br/><br/>It's the far right that gave us a House dominated by narrow minded ideologues without a clue how to govern or a scintilla of loyalty to country above party.  Mitt Romney was not at all their cup of tea and he never got their whole hearted support.  Trump, however, couldn't be more different from Romney.  Polar opposites, really.  Much more the hard right's cup of tea. <br/><br/>The right deeply resents the social changes that America has undergone since WW2, what most of us see as a welcome and overdue evolution.   Indeed, those changes are absolutely repugnant to the hard right.  When Obama painted them as bitter and clinging in their bitterness to their guns and Bibles, he was spot on.  We ignore them at our own peril.  Bitter, deeply offended, and ignorant people are ripe fruit for demigods.   See Hitler, Adolf; Germany 1930s.  We should never forget that Hitler was democratically elected.   Trump is leading in the polls.  Don't suppose that reason will out with the Republican electorate.  Bitterness, anger will trump it. (sorry, couldn't resist)

i'm no fan of macro analyses, especially when they put the political system at the apex of human concerns.<br/><br/>less than one third of US employees are "engaged" (fulfilled) at work, and these are predominantly in the managerial and owner ranks. the people who slog in the trenches are not engaged and not rewarded. focus attention there instead. <br/><br/>humanity is not "alienated" in the traditional sense -- they're just tired of it all. tired of the piling up of problems, work arounds, conflicts, restrictions, and decreasing quality of life, capacity for control and assurance of security in an economic environment that depends on depleting nonrenewable resources and savaging the planet for profit.<br/><br/>where are we headed?<br/><br/>these problems are complex. sanders, trump gain their popularity from the fact that they offer simple solutions with the conviction that the solutions they propose (or promise they will implement) can solve the problems. they are panacea candidates. <br/><br/>they contrast with the candidates -- bush, clinton, et al. -- that come out of the broken management system and therefore are a priori simply going to perpetuate the solutions that do not work.<br/><br/>"trump's support base is weird." only if you believe politics matters. if you believe life matters, then humanity is coming to recognize we are in a hole, and only digging deeper. <br/><br/>trump is a simplistic answer to a problem we all can feel but won't admit exists: "we can't go on like this."

710
What, pray tell, is Trump going to "get done"? Bluster and insults don't translate into policy.  I went to his campaign website <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com" title="https://www.donaldjtrump.com" target="_blank">https://www.donaldjtrump.com</a> to see where he stood on issues. He says nothing about issues or proposed policy. Most campaign websites give at least some hints about where the candidate stands on foreign policy, taxes, budgets, health care, Social Security, etc. Trump's site says absolutely nothing about any of that. It's all about his success as a businessman and how he's ahead in the polls. He seems to think he can step into the Oval Office and turn the U.S.A into a profitable business again just by sheer force of will. He seems to think he can be a dictator, the way CEOs are within their own companies. But with no policy ideas and no clue how to work with Congress, he'd be utterly ineffectual. We might as well elect a sandwich. 

711
Trump's less educated slightly secular support base is weird? I dont think so. Religious folks dont relate to trump, with his unflinching worship of the dollar and the strong. Less educated (white--trump has no base of color) folks relate to the easiest argument of all: everyone else is a moron. You dont have to know anything to embrace that one stop argument, and it provides an antidote to the humiliation that is constantly dished out to them by the culture and to which they have few answers and fewer heroes. That they feel humiliated is a black mark on the larger culture. The demagogic antidote in the person of trump is bad for everyone. 

712
Why does a corporation's right to make money trump the rest of the people's right to breathe clean air or drink clean water?  This is the essential argument isn't it?  That coal industry profits should come before breathing clean air.  Does the coal industry deny that smog is a thing and it unpleasant for the people who have to live in it?  The only clean coal is the coal that stays in the ground and is never mined.

If Trump were a fictional character, we might accuse his author of unsubtlety in choosing that name for him: trumps; trumpery; “blowing your own trumpet”; and then there’s the character Trompart, Bragadochio's herald, in The Faerie Queene.

if trump appeals to those who feel alienated because their needs are not being heard or met, and the rich do not play "by the same rules" as they do; why would they trust a billionaire who has a history of not playing by the rules that most are required to follow?<br/>The documentary exposing his history of flaunting the  rules, his disregard for the working poor and blue collar workers, and his  racial bigotry, which was suppressed by Trump in the 80s ,  now available online, might give some of his ardent followers pause.

716
Your essay is careful not to attribute "bunk" to Republicans (alone). But let's be clear: the alliance between certain elements of the American plutocracy and tha great majority of social conservatives, an alliance at the core of Republican strength today, cannot work without bunk:that is, without a purposeful campaign of almost limitless misinformation. The trumped-up (a bad pun) reaction to the abortion videos, the Iran statements and the universal dismissal of global warming are examples. Consider the last: not one of the 17 (is it 17 now?) Republicans running for president admits that climate change is a man-made problem that requires obvious, serious, collective solutions. No Republic will get elected if he/she says what they have to know to be true. (Or are they ALL genuine idiots?) It is doubtless that Clinton will lie about some things. But the "bunk requirement" that Republican candidates accept as the first condition of their campaigning is something different.<br/><br/>One other point: I do not believe we recover from our lies. We tell lies to fool others but we cannot help but start to believe them ourselves. The rest of us can hope that if one of these guys wins, he/she will turn out better than self-advertised. It won't happen: we'd do better to see them as Governor Wises in the making.

trump's contribution to the primary contest will be acting as the starter in a race (to the bottom) or as the mechanical rabbit in a dog race or pace car in the indy 500. he will uncover in most of the other GOP candidates that they share  of his disdain for the poor, immigrants and evidence based thought as they try to catch up with him rather than try to disavow the racism and ignorance that he represents.<br/>long may he prosper!

720
The comments of the pundits. tv and press, on trump are appalling. The focus is on his attacks on others- and the chatter assumes he was a business success.<br/>CHECK THE  FACTS. His Dad started him with $200 million. He invested it in business after business that went broke or bankrupt- mostly with other people's money. He then got into tv, where he was a successful promoter- (you're fired!). With his new persona, he was able to sell his name to builders of towers, golf courses etc. Made a lot of money selling his name.<br/>Fine. But what about any of this qualifies him to be President???<br/>NOTHING. What is going on???

721
We, the voters are politically ignorant, naive and stupid. The GOP voters love the rich and the super rich people love Koch brothers, Adelson, Trump . More over Trump is a reality TV star and we people are crazy about TV stars. Then rest of the GOP presidential candidates are not impressive and have no charisma and the establishment Republicans are proven" all talk do nothing " leaders (look at the congress). So Trump is the 'trump' for Republican voters. This Trump phenomena prove the Republican party is intellectually and morally bankrupt. Bernie Sanders is intelligent and man of conviction but not electable in today's America. Support for him proves that the Democratic voters stand on high moral ground.

722
The Pentagon released a report in 2014 detailing how drastic weather, rising seas and changing storm patterns could become “threat multipliers” for the United States, vastly complicating security challenges faced by American forces, the Pentagon.  Climate change is a global security issue.  What Republican-backed corporate interest trumps that fact?

W sent our army to afghanistan to destroy Al,Qeada.  But then, W thought Al Qaeda a d-list threat, because he changed his mind, and sent our army to Iraq, where he created an A-list enemy.  ISIS!  Now we've the devil (trump) to pay.  The only thing Trump has going for him is that he would find a general like MacArthur who wanted to nuke the chinese.  Now, its time to think about nuking isis.<br/>Trump 2016  Start the countdown.  

724
Frankly as much of a clown or demigod that trump is, I wonder, Can he do any worse?We have corrupt , lazy , incompetent  people running the government for any one but the people they represent.Can Trump do worse than your average Politician?

725
It never ceases to amaze that the willful ignorance of so many conservatives trumps the best interests of their constituents.<br/>I am open minded. If there is a solid refutation of the anthropogenic Climate Change model, lets hear it. I will however place one condition, the scientists putting forth this competing model must not be funded by fossil fuel interests.<br/>In the years that I have been following this issue, every single one of the papers, articles and books that have come out denying climate change have all been traced back to funding, either overt or covert, from fossil fuel concerns.<br/>This is a blatant conflict of interest, that elected representatives will seek to upend any legislation which seeks to restrict emissions, while also accepting campaign donations and other considerations from fossil fuel concerns.  That it is business as usual in congress (and elsewhere in government) only illustrates the complicity of large parts of government in this corruption.<br/>For a moment lets put aside the whole climate change issue and instead focus solely on pollution. It is without any doubt that fossil fuel consumption produces air pollution. Even 'clean coal' is only clean by comparison to ordinary coal burning. It is still a filthy air polluter. As most of the US population lives in urban centers, the continued refusal to accept any pollution controls dooms all of us to more cases of asthma, lung cancers and an overall poorer quality of life due to poor air quality. 

726
"The group — headed in part by Roger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration..."<br/><br/>Well, that explains everything.  This is just a continuation of the Bush administration's ballyhooed "No Lump of Coal Left Behind" initiative.  I suppose we should all breathe a collective sigh of relief that Republicans aren't yet deciding for medical doctors the only course of treatment for all serious illness, too.  Does the Republican Party support any of the collective majority consensus findings of the world's most educated and respected scientists and academics on any subject?  Even in the highly unlikely event the majority of the world's smartest scientists are wrong about climate change and its man made causes, is breathing cleaner air not worth curbing power plant emissions?  While many can appreciate Mitch McConnell's anguish over job loss in the coal industry in the state of Kentucky and anywhere where coal is mined, should the financial well-being of any industry or state trump the health and well-being of our entire country and the planet?   While this Republican drive to dismantle President Obama's plan on climate change is hardly surprising, it is highly distressing, unconscionable and reckless, nonetheless.  No American should ever vote for any political candidate who is anti-science.

727
SAY WHAT?  Mitch McConnell, whose main goal  in Congress since Obama was elected has been to oppose everything Obama proposes merely because he's Obama, has outdone himself.  In making remarks about Obama's initiative to increase efforts to moderate global climate change, McConnell has actually said is it a triumph of blind ideology over sound policy and honest compassion.  Shockingly he was not speaking about himself, as he is the most guilty of blind ideology trumping reason.  He's even set himself against an essentially market-based solution that worked with ending acid rain and will work with slashing carbon emissions!  All because Obama made the proposal.  Obama has said repeatedly that if anyone else has a better idea to improve his plan, his door is only open.  So far the only times I've known of McConnell darkening his doorway was to do battle with Obama, eat a meal with him or play golf.  Great job, Mitch!  It's hard to imagine what could be clearer evidence of sloth, ideology and meanness than how McConnell has done his job so far.  Obama's plan will lessen our carbon footprint in spite of McConnell, not because of his leadership in addressing the most pressing issue of our day:  Global climate change.  Ah, I forgot, down where McConnell lives, they believe the Earth was created in 7 days and that science is so much hooey.  Well science has stopped acid rain and can do much to slow global climate change, no thanks to Mitch and the great conservative cabal.

728
Rupert Murdoch must be giddy, knowing that Thursday's debate would draw the largest viewership in history even if nine candidates backed out. The only way possible to trump the contest (pun intended?) would be a renewal of "Celebrity Apprentice" by NBC.<br/>I'll be dumbing down with the masses, popcorn in lap, beer-can helmet securely fastened--what is America coming to?

729
Fox has a decision center? Hilarious. On the lobby directory, it's listed as the Department of Demagoguery. It's bad enough that the media are trumpeting Trump 24/7. Remember, the media also led us to believe that Jeb was the smart brother. Enough is enough.

730
I didn't shudder in the slightest. This is a scientific discussion about tissue that can be used to save human lives. There is no disregard for human life, except on the part of the anti-abortion Republicans, who are happy to trumpet the lives of the unborn while continually using every bit of their power to remove the most basic support systems from the born -- unless they're born with the power to solve all their own economic and social problems. Planned Parenthood has a long and honorable history of providing health care for women, particularly poor and under-represented women. Is this a bad ting? Don't be silly. 

731
Since when should YOUR religious beliefs trump women's right to privacy (to use birth control, or in the absence of contraception, terminate an unwanted pregnancy)?<br/><br/>Why should you decide how all of our taxpayer money is used?

732
Is this ever the dog days where the non-news items dominate the scene. The real news is that there are 17 Republican candidates, each one less qualified than the others, scrambling for a few minutes of time on Fox News. Those down in the polls spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on TV adds just to get inched up a few notches in the polls to make these 'debates" on Thursday. I have never been so ashamed of the American political system. This is truly a case of superficial artifice "trumping" any substance. May all of them lose--but in fact by participating in this sorry charade, all of them have. 

733
Saying that Trump is anti Immigration is not right. Anti illegal immigration is what he and many others in the party are. Somehow this makes me a racist, because I am for law and order. I married my wife in Honduras and went thru the long and sometimes painfully legal process to get her here. I understand why people want to take the shortcuts, life in these places sucks. but that is neither our fault nor our responsibility, and allowing the continued illegal immigration into our country will not solve the problems in those places. I and Donald trump are all for Legal immigration into the country. we do not need immigration overhaul, we have a system and it works, what we need is enforcement of the laws we have, and secure boarders and enforce our sovereignty as a nation. you want in, go thru the process. Prove you have something to offer, that your not a criminal and want to be an American. Teddy Roosevelt said "We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here does in good faith become an American and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with every one else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birth-place or origin. But this is predicated upon the man’s becoming in very fact an American and nothing but an American. If he tries to keep segregated with men of his own origin and separated from the rest of America, then he isn’t doing his part as an American. There can be no divided allegiance here. . ."

Joe Biden may or may not be a viable alternative but as far as I'm concerned it's anyone BUT Clinton. This country can do without a Clinton dynasty. Enough already!<br/><br/>And no, the issue with Hill isn't an "exaggerated favorability problem." It's an exaggerated "BELIEVABILITY" problem. There's an absence of honesty and integrity that people (at least those who aren't wearing rose-colored glasses) can see right through. She is seen for what she is, an opportunist who consistently speaks with forked tongue; who will say whatever she has to say to get elected (just like Bill.) If she takes a stand on an issue it's backed by polls and demographics and strategically advantageous to her (and Bill's) agenda. <br/><br/>There are many of us who are not impressed in the least with Clinton or her "message" (whatever that happens to be) and are tired of the "inevitability" because, despite all the campaign rhetoric, this is one candidate who does not represent the middle class, the working class or has a genuine progressive bone in her body. (Anyone looking for those attributes should look elsewhere.)<br/><br/>As for the throngs of Hillary's faithful supporters, fantasy and the "will to believe" continue, as always, to trump facts and inconvenient truths.<br/><br/><a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/12/hillary-clinton-wall-streets-pick-2016/" title="http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/12/hillary-clinton-wall-streets-pick-2016/" target="_blank">http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/12/hillary-clinton-wall-streets-pick-2016/</a>

I am not Zimbabwean, but I have spent time in Africa. During my time there, it was not unusual to hear the sentiment shared by Nzou: that the West cares more about the animals of Africa than the people there.  To this regard, I pose a question: how would the conservation landscape change if there was more investment and less stark poverty in Africa? Yet, in our policies and our choices, we fail as a nation to understand the deep connections between the two. <br/><br/>However, this opinion is extremely anthropocentric and assumes that society should inherently favor human life over the lives of other mortal beings (without regard to context and circumstance).  Just because villagers have struggles with local wildlife -- an important conservation issue/struggle that is shared among virtually all endangered wildlife populations including those in the US -- does not mean that the needs of the villagers should trump all considerations of local wildlife.  In fact, from a high level, Nzou comments only seem to bolster the argument that villages need much assistance to successfully manage and co-exist with wildlife.<br/><br/>Lastly, Nzou should note: 1) there are groups in the US who are actively critical of US policy with regard to its own animal populations, and 2) these issues are international. Animals cannot defend themselves from human exploitation; preservation of our world's important resources should not be left to societal constructs of geopolitical boundaries and nationalism.

The question Tom writes about illustrates that GOPers' problem is not Trump, who, after all, proposed a one-time net wealth tax on all assets held by individuals worth $10 Million$ or more:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS" title="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?...</a><br/><br/>The problem with GOP'ers is Grover Norquist and his anti-tax pledge that almost every single GOP'er has signed, which would cost any GOP'er their job, were they to vote to raise taxes - fealty to Norquist's anti-tax pledge is placed above all else by GOP'ers, including their oaths of office, since we saw them deliberately squander the serial Clinton surpluses and borrow to pay for 2 wars over 2000-2008, rather than raise taxes to defend the country.<br/><br/>The rot that has taken over GOP'ers is far far far worse than Trump; it is a rot so bad that even to defend the country against those they say attacked us on our own shores, they would not raise taxes to pay for war against those they said were our attackers - they chose to borrow and spend in order to keep their jobs and not be ' primaried ' by their anti-tax wing.<br/><br/>No company nor country long thrives, nor even survives, under such a scenario of revenue constriction, which is what makes the GOP'ers such radical anarchists.<br/><br/>Tom is on the right track asking about raising gas taxes, but the more critical question for candidates is " Did you sign Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge " ?

737
This would be much more persuasive if Katha Politt shared her own experience of having or not having an abortion. If she never had one maybe she once had a discussion with a boyfriend about the possibility of having one. Lead by example.<br/><br/>Even as I strongly support unfettered rights to even late term abortions I recognize that abortion is always an ugly procedure in concept and as the term progresses, truly awful in reality by the third trimester. I don't know anyone who is proud of having one at any stage and asking people to trumpet something they aren't proud of is asking for a lot.<br/><br/>Rather than ask people to do something that goes against the basic instinct of presenting their best face to the world, let's do a better job of reminding people why abortion is such an important right.<br/><br/>This is not a choice about which flavor of ice cream to buy. For many women it's a true matter of life or death. Faced with having a baby when they aren't ready for one, and without the option of a safe abortion, many women will seek to end their pregnancies in ways that threaten their own lives. <br/><br/>Women will get abortions whether they are legal or not. Keeping abortion safe and legal saves the lives of real, fully formed, people. In my book the lives of grown people are worth more than those of embryos or fetuses. That's why I support abortion rights.  

738
Certainly Nate Cohn's erudite analysis accounts for all the usual factors that modern political science demands not the least of which is the "media effect" in order to explain trumps popularity. In my opinion, Trumps popularity is better understood in psychological terms and offers a glimpse into the American psyche among an increasingly "low information," cynical electorate that views news and politics as entertainment. Our politics should at least entertain!  Who better than The Donald!!  

739
If, as Bruce Bartlett suggested, Trump got the nomination and was soundly defeated, that would not end the Tea Party — they would still be trumpeting their view of things and would find some way to blame everyone else for the loss, probably with new conspiracy theories. The problem is that the GOP has created a monster, Fox News, that generates outright lies for political purposes — the word for this is "propaganda" — while at the same time cutting funding for education to ensure that a larger and larger proportion of the populace is uneducated and can be led around by those lies. This juggernaut has now gathered steam and is lurching around the countryside, and is completely uninfluenced by what actually happens in the real world.

DW - "It would be great to have the "first president who stutters." <br/><br/>After our first bi-racial President we must have our first female President then we must run down the list of races, ethnic groups, religions and sexual orientations that have yet to have a representative turn as President before we can get to a President who stutters.<br/><br/>It has become apparent that leadership qualifications and experience have been "trumped" by political correctness!

Got a leg up on the solve last night, after filling in half the grid slept on it. Awoke this morning to write over this pair of theme related answers: IN THE (dog) BIG HOUSE and UP THE (creek) RIVER.  You see, I had no theme to APPLY during act 1 of the solve. With a night's rest and recharged brain cells I caught on to the puzzle's hoosegawian topic. One other problem was opting for the wrong Davis; penciling in Bette RATHER than OSSIE...Straight from the vague and unknown collection of mind bending speed bumps today: UTNE and LA BUTE...More than 50 years later and sporting 12 1/2 million you-tube hits, this merry old soul's trumpet driven tune still swings.

If those opposed to abortion can imagine a reason to go to war that trumps the deaths that ensue, then surely they can understand that a woman's right to live her life as an equal and independent person trumps the death of an unborn fetus.

743
The Republican obsession with limiting democracy and shutting down government  'trumps' all logic.      <br/><br/>Their only ideas are two bad ideas designed to serve them and their ilk, and they're committed to using every lying, cheating stealing tactic available to them to pursue that badness.<br/><br/>The purpose of government is to level the playing field of human progress.    The subversion of government to serve mammon at the expense of humans and human progress is evil.<br/><br/>Progressive ideas that fosters the right to vote, the right to health care, te right to preserve the planet, equality for women, and equality for ALL other law abiding folks of ALL ilk does represent overreach in areas of the world that still fight those ideas.   Perhaps that's where Republicans should live.

744
Obama cheated.  He bussed in students from Illinois to disrupt and hijack the Iowa caucuses.   Hillary was leading in all the polls going into the caucuses, then voila Obama emerges the winner, and many many narratives were published on how it went down.   Young people lieing and pushing their way in and taking over the discussion.  That is "community organizing", Chicago style.  Yes, it happened. There were also many reports of similar behavior in TX caucuses, and mishandled ballots in their vote (TX does both vote and caucus).   That and the ridiculous claims of racism that the media picked up and trumpeted even though it should be clear at this point, even to the stupidest Americans, that the racist in the room is Obama himself. 

745
This is most certainly a dimension that must be added to the debate. But...<br/><br/>"Where are the men grateful not to be forced into fatherhood?"<br/><br/>Don't go there. That men can be forced into fatherhood or denied fatherhood without any input into the decision whatsoever is a grievous injustice. That said, men walking away from their responsibility is as much or more of an injustice (since it impacts two lives not one). And "pro-lifers" who advocate policies that relegate newborns to the dumpster of poverty, neglect and abuse are bald faced hypocrites. <br/><br/>There are many dimensions to this debate and all need to be a part of it.<br/>Can we find a "solution" that is not based on allowing one injustice to trump another?

Too many elephants endanger the environment? What are you talking about? The elephant population in Africa has been reduced by 60% in the last ten years. 35,000 of them are being killed every year for their ivory.

what a sinister and cynical article.<br/><br/>you easily could write the same kind of article about hillary--whose supporters probably endorsed this piece.<br/><br/>i'd like to hear from biden.  his occasional so-called "mis-speaking" is a beltway reporters' issue--has misspeaking hurt donald trump?<br/><br/>my main concern would be biden's age.  but i have many more concerns about hillary.  and many people, i think, share beau biden's son's view:  let's not let the clintons, and their surge for privacy and money, take back the country.<br/><br/>yes, we'll vote for hillary if there's no viable alternative--voting for a republican these days would be a measure of insanity.<br/><br/>but this article is no help at all.

There's really no point in posing thoughtful questions for the myriad of Republican candidates since Jeb Bush is going to win the nomination.  Jeb Bush is really just a more serious (&amp;dangerous) version of Donald Trump behind the trumpeting ballast of his fiery &amp; hyperbolic rhetoric.  The only manner in which the Republican Party (orchestrated by billionaires) can win over high school educated, blue collar people is by repeating the same themes over &amp; over again until them become a battle cry of the Republic.  <br/><br/>Read my lips, no new taxes<br/>Strong military, strong America<br/>Biblical values are key to a moral society<br/>Climate change is a hoax concocted by Liberals<br/>Fossil Fuel/Coal production is key to an Independant America<br/>Federal deficit needs to be cut by cutting programs<br/>Entitlements lead to a lazy underclass<br/>Social Security/Medicare need to be privatized<br/>Obamacare is example of Federal government overreach<br/>Federal government is wasteful - leave it up to States<br/>Cut government regulation - let free markets prosper<br/>Immigration is out of control - build huge walls &amp; get tough<br/>Farm subsidies are important lifeblood of economy<br/>Increase free trade including TPP - trickle down economy<br/>No minimum wage<br/>No unions<br/>Transform Universities into For Profit Enterprise Zones<br/>Individual Responsibility <br/><br/>What the above Koch designed platform neglects to mention is that the collective boat will eventually sink due to the greedy scum at the bottom which is the Plutocracy.

You ignore a main point of the article, however, which is that the killing of the lion caused so much outrage when much worse things happen to human beings, not to mention other animals, all the time. <br/><br/>And I think "educated countryman" is a bit vague a credential for this comment. Your entire comment is a deference to this mystery man. <br/><br/>In addition, you assert that the viewpoint of "educated countryman" somehow trumps the viewpoint of a person who grew up in a village in Zimbabwe. How can you say his words mean more than Goodwell's? I am talking about when you say how lions are viewed by the people in Zimbabwe. <br/><br/>And nowhere does he state that Cecil was a threat. As I interpreted it, he just wants people to understand the way lions affect the lives of the people of Zimbabwe, and that they don't go on a pedestal like the media has  portrayed.

For a region to succeed economically it needs skilled workers; it needs an education system that prepares those workers; it needs markets, both internal and external; it needs the means to produce something that the economy needs at a decent profit; and yes, it needs a regulatory/tax climate that does not get in the way of these things.<br/><br/>The ideologues who control Kansas believe that low taxes on the wealthy trump all the other factors, and that low taxes alone will cause businesses to spring up from the plains.  Note that they are not against high taxes for consumption, which disproportionately burden lower-income families: they seem to forget that these people are consumers.<br/><br/>But I ask what multinational would want to set up anything but the most low-level operation in Kansas, not when people, skills, equipment, suppliers must all be imported.  Today's global capitalists want the full package waiting for them. Kansas offers only low taxes.  It offers less and less to generate -- or retain -- the educated workforce that a modern economy requires.  The jobs it is most qualified to fill are those that are, increasingly, roboticized.<br/><br/>I envision a future Kansas of 50,000 people and 3 million corn-growing, chicken-processing robots.  It is probably more realistic than Governor Brownback's vision.

Please explain what is so terribly "wrong" about "this." Are you merely reacting to an obvious emotional ploy to a claim that, once examined, is more truly a benefit to society in the larger sense? Defunding/dismantling PP will do nothing to stop dreaded abortions for, as always and ever, they WILL BE performed, however and whenever. <br/><br/>The agitators will have you think that ideology can trump biology. Touting abstinence has never, will never, work in preventing sex between those desiring it. The best thing society can do is recognize inherent biological urges and to make policies to ensure the healthiest outcomes. <br/><br/>Do antiabortionists and their handlers want a larger permanent underclass, full of unwanted "babies" who grow into marginalized adults? Are you counting on this population to remain ignorant and not vote, so that anti-choice moralists can have the electoral upper hand? Do you think that these same unwanted "babies" and their birthers will suddenly be self-sufficient, not requiring other government services from nutrition to mental health support and plenty in between, those same services that are constantly underfunded and under attack by the GOP?<br/><br/>Or do you believe in fairies?

One of THE most appalling moments I've ever witnessed.<br/>I actually think he trumped Trump, and I thought Trump's leading that pack of salivating hounds was appalling enough.<br/>Has it come to this, oh party of Lincoln?

Graham appears to trying to out-trump the Donald for attention. With the possible exception of John Kasich, this GOP field looks like the cast on some low-life TV reality show. Is this what the party of Eisenhower has evolved into, mudslinging, lying desperation.

754
It isn't arrogant to see the many holes in this Op-Ed.<br/><br/> The writer is saying that village life concerns on a local level trumps any other discussion. That he is a scientist saying that is funny/sad.

If just 3% of Planned Parenthood's budget goes to abortions, it doesn't seem that trumpeting the fact that you've had an abortion or facilitated one makes a lot of sense as a "defense" of PP. <br/><br/>Far better, it would seem, to focus on how they actually spend their funds: on cancer screening, contraception and counseling, testing and treatment for STDs, and other women's health services. Over 50% of their budget goes to the cancer screening and STD testing and treatment. Those are, or should be, noncontroversial benefits to society that really deserve to be in the forefront of the defense of this organization.<br/><br/>I don't think that women declaring their personal history of terminations is not going to alleviate the stigma of abortion. It was done in the 70s and later, by prominent feminists, and yet we're having this discussion today.  A woman's decision to have an abortion may not be difficult, given her circumstances, but that doesn't mean it won't be fraught with sadness and possibly regret later. But above all, isn't it a private decision?

Nate Silver of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com" title="fivethirtyeight.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight.com</a> has an interesting take on The Donald. While leading in the polls, he also has the 2nd highest unfavorable ratings among Republican voters. So, "reasonable" or "thoughtful" Republicans, who are dwindling as we speak, find Trump to be onerous. But the knuckle-draggers who make up a large part of the GOP find his comments "refreshing" or "honest and genuine."<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of German folks in the 30s found Hitler's comments "honest and genuine" too.<br/><br/><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/" title="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/" target="_blank">http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop...</a>

Mike Huckabee is giving Christianity a very bad name.  It not very nice to take Jewish scared experiences, tragedies and icons and convert them into political capital just to get a space on the Fox debate stage.  It also begs an uncomfortable question:  The Iranians do not have nuclear weapons and won't get them anytime soon if we're smart enough to implement the Iran agreement.  Israel does have them.  Obama's just trying to keep everyone from marching anyone anywhere.  Hopefully, the voters in the Republican primaries will march Huckabee off the political stage once and for all.  Sorry, Mike but you just can't trump Trump!

I don't undestand why earnestness or sincerity or true belief trumps math and logic when it comes to taxes yet "job creators" should react only to the logic of a tax free enviornment and ignore all the other qualitative factors.<br/><br/>I don't find these folks very pragramatic either in spite of their wishes to be seen that way.

THE REAL PROBLEM IS DIVERSE CULTURAL VALUES . . .<br/><br/>...as we have to face the truth that many underclass blacks have dysfunctional cultural values which (among many other aspects) lead to lower income. Ergo, housing choices which become far more limited.<br/><br/>Also, behaviors which all of the middle class finds distasteful or even threatening and/or dangerous. Class trumps race.<br/><br/>I was once invited to a benefit awards ceremony for a prominent black actor ... where about 95% of the participants were African-American. All were at least middle class. I saw no difference in any of them when compared to a similar demographic group of whites.<br/><br/>People like to talk about the "black problem" or the discrimination which is visited upon Hispanics, What is really happening is that the minorities and whites (of the underclass) display in much larger numbers a propensity for negative behaviors. Slavery and most of Jim Crow is gone.<br/><br/>Yes, racism still exists but, people like the "Teflon Rev." exaggerate it and make a living out of it. Improve the culture and most discrimination will end as people will be able to live where ever they can afford, And, the very interaction will displace discrimination. <br/><br/>The Bronx became the South Bronx as a result of an exodus of many middle class whites as the minorities who displaced them behaved in inappropriate ways as it became dangerous to live there.<br/><br/>PC has a place ... but until we face problems with forthrightness, the situation will continue.

Dr. K,<br/><br/>Style and spectacle in political campaigns and punditry almost always trumps (no pun intended) substance.<br/><br/>Candidates must be skilled in method acting to gain the support of their party to gain the nomination.  Once nominated they must resort to euphemisms, or code words that will play to the concerns of a larger constituency, which most times is personal finance sometimes cloaked in macroeconomic or fiscal policy issues that are causing the economy to tank: leaky borders, outsourcing, inflation, etc.<br/><br/>The test is how they would perform in a real crisis and their ability to be realistic.  A good test of their ability to handle realism will be their position on global warming and how they will approach this real problem.<br/><br/>It will be a tough campaign because a lot of the BIG MONEY comes from the fossil fuel industry and it is huge so I don't envy the candidates or the pundits.  So I don't really expect anything to happen unless there is a real crisis.  There are some issues which will require more than just lip service such as surface transportation.  I believe the poor condition of our transport system is the reason our economy has been slowing for several decades.  Congestion around our metro areas is literally killing and maiming us and we need to do something to augment the existing systems.  I see it as an opportunity to create a new industry based on superconducting Maglev technology but know that to compete the system it must be tested and demonstrated by Gov't.

the media keeps avoid the main reason we like trump--he fights back against the media...<br/><br/>we don't like the media...trump is our weapon against the media...<br/>and that scares the media...

Please. Let's attempt to achieve even a modest step toward peaceful coexistence before we reject out of hand an agreement that is overwhelmingly supported by the world, with of course the exception of the current Israeli government and the GOP. You mention Clinton's personal, familial, and moral transgression yet you ignore Bush's trumped-up invasion of Iraq. Clinton's BJ didn't kill 5000 American lives. Hello? Anyone there?

Style and substance...<br/>Yesterday, reacting to an article in the NYT regarding the occasion of the terribly tragic death of Cecil, a lion that was recently murdered in Zimbabwe, I opined that America, The Stupid, had bigger fish to fry than the issue of a lugubrious dentist on safari.<br/>How about working on issues like war, refugees and slavery before you stop the presses for one old predatory beast of the wild?<br/>Here's an excerpt from a reply to my post:<br/>"This is laughable. You're letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Why in the world should we eradicate war, refugees and slavery before trying to protect endangered animals."<br/>Yes, why indeed?<br/>Why worry about insignificant issues like war or slavery when "we" can all elevate ourselves by hating obvious lowlife creeps like the safari hunter or some rich strumpet?<br/>Well, I'll tell you why...<br/>Because those issues are far more important. Period.<br/>If you cannot even see that, then I will never be able to help you.

768
The squeaky wheel that is eminates from the conservatives creates the illusion that that they will triumph in this upcoming  presidential election.  The metrics however, suggest the opposite. The Liberal base including Whites, Hispanic, African American, will have the numbers to "trump" the much louder but much smaller conservative demographic. Be afraid my friends on the right, be very afraid.

769
This kind of idea i would usually agree with however when the idea involves having our next leaders to be chosen by privileged people born with silver spoons shoved down their throats then it is not something i can agree with. A lot of the rich out there down really work as hard as most say, shocker, a lot of them are tired after a long day of work of managing companies however managing company doesn't seem like its as hard as the many minorities work in the their factories doing back breaking labor. A lot of these business owners don't give their workers the needed benefits from working hard JUST TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. Minorities have enough to deal with without having to put forth even more effort just to vote and make sure our next leader isn't a rich loving "Donald trump". Minorities who have been through difficult times are the only ones who truly understand what its like to work two jobs just to feed your family so its logical to assume they are the ones with the most compassion and street smarts to know if that politician is fake.

American negotiators and the allies — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China -- can be trumped by one tiny nation interfering in U.S. politics? Show how corrosive the Israel lobby in the U.S. is when they can get the U.S. to engage in another thoughtless war for them.

772
What this comes down to is the undo influence that Israel has on the US political and legislative process. That a foreign government literally has a number of elected politicians in its pocket hectoring for a deal that is not in the best interests of their constituents, the American people, seems to go unaddressed. Another party to the spear rattling is the manufacturers of the weaponry and support services ready to make billions of taxpayer dollars not only for our defense but the generous subsidies and direct gifts that benefit Israel. The real question is why has israel's interests continued to trump our own?

Like - for example you could have pondered about the role of sarcasm and irony in daily life in the US - How important comic relief has become and that in the age of trump-ing at everything comic relief has become - and thus how important comedians have become and about the deeper meaning of the deeper relationship between somebody like Jon Stewart and Obama - who is a sensational comedian in his own world too - and why it has become so important to really smile about such a silly review of Jons work and not to write the editor and tell him that you demand to get Mr. Kolbin fired -(as a comedian)

This was far from an effortless solve. I got stuck with BAPTISM under FIRE, the answer that alerted me that something was up with the solve. It wasn't until I abandoned 'under' for 'by' I was able to sharpen focus on the grid. AS IF by MAGIC was the last of the four to fall evoking visions of MHP dancing in my head. I'm predominantly a dead tree solver...Katrina's almost ten years gone and the Crescent City still reels. Mayor Ray Nagin may still be in jail, who cares? At least the House of Blues is up and running in The Quarter. That's where DR. JOHN covered Leadbelly's "Goodnight Irene" some four years ago. Sorry, the clip ends during a rousing trumpet solo.

You can put away your thesaurus.  While I agree that DC needs to be cleaned out, trump isn't the one to do it.  The voters can.  It isn't the "left" that keeps electing anti-science, anti-education, anti-poor, anti-middle class, anti-health care, anti-intellectual people.

TRUMP'S TRUMPET is sounding off key again.  He's going to build a security wall?  Someone ought to tell the Donald that the Great Wall of China is nothing more than a tourist curiosity now.  The Berlin wall has disappeared for the most part with some small sections remaining as a reminder of its violent past.  Donating to Scott Walker without knowing his policies is laughable.  I'd never thought of Trump as throwing money around to solve a problem.  Donating $10 million to women's choice I would venture to say will not play well with many in the GOP.  He's everywhere and nowhere.  And, as with a Divinity, he can do anything.  Trump's trumpeting of his magical thinking would be laughable if he didn't appeal to so many in the GOP.  It's scary.  My fervent hope is that he'll run as an independent with Palin as his VP. 

781
What are the options?  Let's take a look:<br/><br/>1.  Without the deal, Iran returns to their currently paused program and will have nuclear capabilities in a matter of months.<br/>2.  If we maintain or increase sanctions, we will go it alone.  Our partners (in the deal) have already  sent representatives to to re-start trading with Iran.  Unilateral sanctions on our part will merely shift trade from U. S. corporations to our "allies".<br/>3.  A military attack on Iran's nuclear sites merely pushed it back:  two-to-three years if by Israel, and four-to-five years by the U.S.  This deal puts it back ten-to-fifteen years.  Israel already has--but doesn't admit--much more nuclear firepower than Iran anyway.  <br/><br/>It's not a perfect deal; but, it is the best of several bad options and, perhaps doing nothing would be the worst of the worst.  Two former Israeli Intelligence chiefs have said that Netanyahu is wrong, and that a U. S. departure from it would leave Israel as the loser.<br/><br/>Politically, Netanyahu is merely fanning the flames of the War-Hawks in the Likud Party.  And, the GOP is kissing-up to Israel to gain political ground and continue to obstruct Obama.<br/><br/>So what do they care if they are allowing Politics to trump (no pun intended) National Security, huh!<br/><br/><a href="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">http://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a>

"Individualism trumps all — and innovation, it is somehow believed, will save the country from individualism’s ravages"<br/><br/>It always has.  And by the way, American innovation has enriched the entire world.  Europeans are welcome to their collectivism, but they ought to acknowledge that they can afford the inefficiencies of their welfare states in part because of the dynamism of a free market dominated by American entrepreneurship.  From medicine to transportation to computers and communications, the world is better off because of American freedom and ingenuity.

783
Again, most interesting article from Mr. Cohen that speaks to the cultural differences that define us by defining others, not unlike a certain Frenchman who did so while observing our penal system. As I drive to work, I am appalled by the barely contained chaos that driving represents with trucks, big SUVs and other vehicles zooming toward some destination, the drive broken up by the encroachment of streets, business establishments and the like intersecting w/the chaos. And the eating alone! All speaks to individualism run amok! No planning for residential, business, transportation, for god forbid that we give up cars, no matter that this has resulted in systems that are close to impossible to manage, financially and safely. Trains!   I live in a state where a different outlook would be beneficial to all, certainly to the worker bees who must endure much to work, to shop, to live.But this state is one believes strongly in so-called individualism," and yes, it trumps all, even if individuals are real estate moguls, road contractors, builders, private prison contractors, private charter school backers, and the ilk. Our sense of the public is not to public education, public transportation, or public squares for citizens, but to build walls, gates, and greater overpasses and additional lanes for traffic. Pessimistic? Hell yes.

784
The Republican party apparently wants to rig the elections as if they are all the 2000 presidential election - cheating their way to victory. Tossing out votes, preventing votes, etc. - are ways for GOP to win - NOT providing policies that voters actually support. An absolutely unAmerican approach by the party that loves to trumpet its love for America. 

785
It's hard to grasp any logic whatsoever in what you say. If the deal is scuttled by Congress, Iran will proceed full-tilt to develop a bomb and the means to deliver it. That is apparently what you want, eh? For some reason, what you don't want is for Iran to postpone nuclear arms development. The sanctions, which are international, are disappearing soon no matter what, so your argument that the treaty gives Iran billions of dollars is bogus. They're going to have that money anyway, and you want them to rush ahead and build a bomb as well???<br/><br/>It's clear that logic and reality are trumped by your mindless opposition to whatever Mr. Obama does. This is the current problem with almost all Republican "positions" these days — they make sense only in a different universe. We could call it "FoxNewsLand."

786
This editorial displays a surprising naivety that certain members of Congress have failed to learn that diplomacy trumps military action even after 14 years of war, thousands of American and Iraqi lives lost, many thousands more people wounded, and billions of tax dollars squandered. How is it you anticipate a different reaction, when these are the same Legislators who have rejected meaningful gun control measures despite the slaughter of twenty plus children at Sandy Hook, and the numerous mass killings before and after; the same folks who reject and continue to oppose access to affordable health care to millions in need; and the same crowd which refuses to acknowledge overwhelming scientific evidence that carbon emissions are causing irreparable damage to our environment. Their’s is not substantive opposition to the Iran proposal based upon thoughtful deliberation and reason, its about denying President Obama a meaningful addition to his legacy. Sadly, this approach has become modern political science 101.    

787
"Individualism trumps all — and innovation, it is somehow believed, will save the country from individualism’s ravages."<br/><br/>But, in America, innovation is the engine of Capitalism. The goal of innovation is to make money so one can hoard and fill-up and consume and vacation and build a perfect house and have two refrigerators filled with any type of soda. Individuals get creative and innovate for selfish reasons. To innovate is evolution, to hoard is natural. But, Perhaps we need some sort of primal transformation, an evolutionary step of sorts, maybe brought on by climate change, that forces our innovation to be all about the communal good, rather than the individual's quest to hoard. Our monetary system is counter-intuitive to this step because it feeds our animistic, natural desire to hoard, to squirrel away the nuts for retirement because everyone is on their own. Money-less, indigenous societies don't live like this.  Is it possible to have an innovative, modern, "indigenous" society without currency, but still motivated to innovate, not for individual comfort or fame or recognition, but for the betterment and survival of the community, of all families?

I recently supervised a construction project with federal funding paying for virtually all of it. It started with the private contractor complaining about the "absurdly high" wages I passed along to her from the U.S. Department of Labor website, that she would have to pay to workers placed into each job classification. <br/><br/>Fine, I said, don't take the federal funding. Go to a bank and get a loan."<br/><br/>These were construction workers and she was arguing that $15.09/hour, with no benefits, was absurdly high.<br/><br/>Throughout the project I was met with obstructionism. I couldn't access the site at times. I couldn't interview employees because she cycled them through the project so quickly they might only be there two days. She hired Spanish-speaking workers to stymie me. I speak Spanish. At each such instance, I withheld the money until I got compliance.<br/><br/>Then I discovered that they were paying laborers at the laborer rates, to remove asbestos when it's required to have licensed asbestos workers, who know how to protect workers and the environment, perform the work at more than double the wage rate. I again had to stop the project while they sorted that one out.<br/><br/>All the while they demanded change orders to pay for these increased costs even though they knew the rules going into the bid process.<br/><br/>Make no mistake. I had their construction budget. I knew she was making millions from this project. But she wanted every last dime she could get.<br/><br/>Greed trumps everything else.

All the whining by those "concerned" over voter ID laws is nothing but posturing to hold on to their racial gravy train. It is inarguable in today's society that people need a government issued photo ID for many necessities. Yet the "concerned bigots" don't spend a single second helping the small number of people that don't have one to get one. It helps feed their own coffers to find the few people that don't have one and trumpet them to the media and yet do nothing to actually help the person.

I despise politics.<br/>I dream of a world where there are no elections, lawmakers, best of all no congress. Unfortunately politics is a heavily needed system. I endure through it every year, but when the presidential race begins, nobody can run from the media coverage. Dissecting candidate's moves, divulging their hidden secrets, these articles are always found on the front page of any newspaper. But instead of Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton dominating these articles, another man has taken over: Donald Trump. From his opinions on Mexico, to his statement on John Mccain, he has certainly left me-as well as many Americans, abuzzed. We know he won’t become president, so why do we keep talking about him? Instead of shaking our heads and moving on, we can’t stop talking about Trump. This Op-ed, not just a witty read, was quite eye opening, making me realize what I had doing the past days. I’ve discussed Trump with all of my friends, who all halfheartedly listen in hopes of finding an exit to the subject. But as Frank Bruni says in his Op-ed, "If we don't discuss him, we ignore something real." That's true in a sense that Trump is leading in national polls, and has measurable support. But others disagree. Politicians are seething, believing Trump is doing all of this to expand his empiric label. What’s my say on the matter? Just like many Americans, I too, have been gripped by Trump, Trump, Trump.<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/opinion/frank-bruni-to-trump-or-not-to-trump.html?_r=0" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/opinion/frank-bruni-to-trump-or-not-to-trump.html?_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/opinion/frank-bruni-to-trump-or-not-to...</a>

The idealized concept of individualism and independence has some major inconsistencies: 1) why do the same companies that trumpet the merits of the invisible hand also lobby incessantly for highly specific, government-provided tax incentives, 2) how can Americans agree that everyone deserves a free education (through HS) but not a guaranteed minimum standard of health care (the market should instead provide health care), and 3) how is it that defense spending (i.e. government spending) in the U.S. accounts for about 20 percent of the federal budget, but is off limits in the discussion of the appropriate roles of the private versus public sectors?  Americans want government that helps them individually, but not anyone else.

794
I was born in Europe, and for years I have longed for the cleanliness, good infrastructure, beautiful plazas and outdoor cafes. I had had it all, but, in spite of the fact that I and my family lived there for over 500 years, the government of the country I was born in one day decided that we were not loyal enough to stay there. The United States welcomed us, and, every time I miss 'home', I remember why I am here. America's welcoming us trumps all that Europe has had to offer, for here I feel that I do belong.

795
First, let's all realize that the polls show Trump with a very low share of the entire electorate. 20+% of Republicans is middle single digits of all voters.<br/><br/>His appeal touches on several very real threads in contemporary society.<br/><br/>First, there's the American tradition of nativism, the national version of NIMBY (not in my backyard), wherein settled immigrants (every citizen of the U.S.) reject anyone else who wants to follow their path.<br/><br/>Enunciating policy becomes irrelevant in a gridlocked political system. Staking out a policy position on any issue is meaningless to many voters because they understand that none of it will be implemented. They ignore the obvious, that bluster will achieve nothing either.<br/><br/>Trump, along with Sanders, accept no PAC money. This has great common appeal to followers of both. That Sanders funding comes from small individual donations and Trump's from his own wealth is irrelevant as independence from big PAC money trumps any policies, or lack thereof.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the Trump base legitimately feels that governance by bluster and fiat are superior to the do-nothing, special interest dominated system currently pretending to govern. Chris Christie was simply a man ahead of his time.<br/><br/>Voters in the Trump camp see no substance in the competition or in Washington. They're "mad as hell, and not going to take it any more!"<br/><br/>The path to derailing Trump is simply the restoration of government by the people, for the people, not by the special interests.

Perhaps it is fitting on the anniversary of the first use of an atomic bomb for people to get a grip on the reality of nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>If Iran really wanted to have the bomb it already could; all that is needed to build an A bomb, other than the trigger mechanism, was published before WW II. Both the Third Reich and Imperial Japan had programs to build an A-bomb but we got there first.<br/><br/>The only real problem for Iran is accumulating enough enriched uranium or plutonium to make a device &amp; our own experts tell us that any effort to do so can be detected via an inspection. Hence the present agreement serves U.S. interests in the short term.<br/><br/>Iran most probably does not want an arms race in its own neighborhood because, unlike most of our senators, Iran appears not to relish unpredictable consequences. However, the threat of developing a nuclear weapon gives Iran the leverage it wants for use in international relations. After all, through the use of the threat Iran now has once engaged with the U.S. &amp; will soon be dealing again with Russia &amp; China with the Europeans soon to follow.<br/><br/>If the U.S. chooses not to engage but instead to trumpet American Exceptionalism it will have even less effect than our long running embargo against Cuba. In fact, America will begin its decline from being a first rate power as well as exercising a leadership role in world affairs

Paul Glastris referred to Tea/Rep aspirants for the GOP candidacy for Presidentof as "accomplished" I think of them as misfits vying to run  a campagn financed by the billionaires they serve, as their last misfit, Romney, did Advicatingy tax and other benefits to the richest in the Nation, at the cost of destroying a safety net that our middle classes and our poor depend upon much more than Tea/Rep soundbites brainwash them to under estimate. Another pillar of that campaign: mashing undocumented migrants, for the most part law abiding hard workers that are contributing to our economy and once legalized would contribute significantly But trumplike they'll go on to appeal to the most base instincts of some Americans proposing to drive undocumented a la Mitt to self deportantion or a la Trump's total deportantion and wall building (he must be panting to build and collect for). Facts are is that depressing worker's income (through miserable minimum wages + pay standards of a 1/4 century ago), destroy the basis of consumer led recoveries as consumer have too little money to buy even essential necessities Add to it the GOP abject refusal of a jobs bill through much needed renewal of Roads Highways Bridges Public Building Railway and Airport modenizations the Outsourcing of Jobs Tax Havens; and the "accomplished" misfit candidates may only elections by spending billions Because our electorate allows them.<br/>politeness are like a snake oil salesmen financed by billionaires

Great observations! I would add that we have an ultra consumer-promoting media that promotes the idea that we shouldn't worry about issues such as: climate change, too many calories for all, conspicuous consumption, etc.<br/><br/>Our media trumpets ideas of self-indulgence that allow us to avoid facing the truth about the long-term consequences of our negative behaviors.<br/><br/>Our media has infantalized us and very few voices are trying to reverse this or are offering us examples of how we could be better.<br/><br/>Why this trend? So the richer get richer, the powerful are able to accumulate more power, and we can always find something to blame for our shortcomings.<br/><br/>One powerful alternative to this process is the social safety net created by FDR, Johnson, and now with the ACA, Obama. In spite of the hatred and lies spread about these matters by the right, these programs are very popular and they show the importance of working together.<br/><br/>Bernie Sanders is certainly promoting these values and upon his campaign rests all of our hopes for a more humane, more farsighted national policy.

Howard Shultz once said something simple and true that I have repeated and applied to my work "execution always trumps strategy". <br/><br/>This is on one hand a true and thoughtful oped but on the other hand, with Mr. Shultz's reluctance to enter the fray, sounds more like strategy than execution. 

801
I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Schultz.  But this pandering equivalence is getting old for self-proclaimed independence.  President Obama is not a humble man -- it's not in his makeup.  However, he has certainly attempted outreach.  He pushed for the Grand Bargain, which was scuttled by the Tea Party.  He pushed for a jobs bill that included corporate tax reform, which the Republicans rejected on site.  He's been trumpeting the importance of investing in our infrastructure, which Republicans continue to ignore.  <br/><br/>Mr. Schultz, for some reason your opinions have been valued by independence.  As such, you have an obligation to speak truthfully about who is the main cause of political intransigence.

802
America's "creative churn, vitality and energy" are misdirected for profit, making them work against us in many cases. Individualism and freedom include the freedom to make bad decisions - but freedom also requires having information and not being pushed hard. Obesity is a good example. People choose fattening foods in response to massive advertising campaigns (advertising works!). These foods are deliberately enhanced with extra sugar, salt and fat to appeal more than less processed foods. Another important factor is that junk food is cheaper and much more readily available than fresh, unprocessed food, especially in poor neighborhoods. Individualism trumps all? Garbage! Heavy persuasion, little information about food content and less choice is more like it. It would make sense to subsidize fresh food for the public good since processed food is heavily subsidized. But special interests fight it. Propaganda misrepresents efforts to improve our diet as infringing freedom. I say Ag Gag laws are an infringement of freedom. The long, long lists of ingredients are information rendered useless by lack of context. Better food at schools introduces children to alternate possibillities (an increase in freedom of choice) and is a subject of bitter political contention. So what is left is the higher profit solutions like baryatric surgery and pills, pills, pills.<br/><br/>Better food policy is not charity for the "less fortunate". It benefits everybody with few exceptions.

To expand on that reference to Ron Fournier who was a colleague of the author here at the Associated Press, the Wikipedia entry on Fournier includes this:<br/><br/>"In July 2008, while investigators for the House Oversight Committee were looking into the death of Pat Tillman, they uncovered a 2004 email from Fournier to Karl Rove encouraging him to "keep up the fight."[5]"<br/><br/>It goes on to recount the numerous other instances of Fournier writing AP "journalism" pieces that were essentially Republican Party propaganda, and in keeping with this were loudly trumpeted by the GOP, Michelle Malkin, Drudge, and so on.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Fournier" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Fournier" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Fournier</a><br/><br/>This is the history of the Associated Press, which the author here is calling objective journalism.

paul, there may be something "clownish" about donald trump, but i think he's good for the republican party and for all of us.<br/><br/>why?  because although he's still unduly "educated" by talk radio, like the rest of the republican candidates (and may be a bit ignorant), he's not stupid, and he's not an ideologue.  some of the things he's saying, in fact, do make sense and they are outside republican ideology.<br/><br/>was paul volcker a good fed chief? yes, mostly.  can we send back to where they came from all our "illegals"?  no, of course not.  do we need to provide support for those most in need?  of course.  trump can say those things--other republicans apparently can't.  and trump will educate many republican voters who don't realize how much nonsense they've been fed.<br/><br/>so, sure, you feel you need to use the "clown" descriptive with trump--because he's an entertainer with no political background and a huge ego.  but go easy.  recognize trump for what he is:  a potential educator of republican voters to some common sense.<br/><br/>heck, he even contributed to hillary (is that good?).

to Fearless.....But they don't want democracy to succeed, they want to influence voters and gain power. Our Democracy myth is a cover. We vote only from the choices the big donors give us.<br/><br/>MSNBC for the left? The just cancelled 3 shows in the afternoon, including Ed Schultz, who was msnbc's main source of Sanders updates, and anti TPP, pro labor argument. Nothing to replace it. <br/><br/>Their evening shows are on the liberal side comparatively, but are getting more hyped up and commercial in tone/topic lately, with 24/7 trump trash. That's for the campaign season, which is really now merchandizing and promotion masquerading as politics. <br/><br/>Besides Canada, Germany didn't allow Murdoch there either. Why isn't this publicized for contrast? <br/><br/>Cronkite, if presented with today's candidates, would say goodnight and walk off the set. <br/><br/>We need a discussion re pros/cons of NPR and PBS. Many think they are too centrist, being careful of their corporate sponsors, whose names we hear recited every hour. 

806
Having just returned from a 2 weeks in Turkey, it is disturbing to see Erdogan &amp; his puppet PM joining the war against ISIS as a pretence to re-ignite their war with the Kurds in what is clearly a blatant attempt to regain political dominance in the country.<br/>Despite comprising ~20% of the Turkish population, Kurds were elected to the Turkish Parliament the 1st time under the banner of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) with 13% of the vote (a party needs 10% to elect a member) &amp; 80 seats. This was revolutionary in Turkish politics as the HDP was elected with not only Kurdish supper but the support of many non-Kurds as well - mostly liberal minded Turks who appreciated their liberal non-sectarian platform and who thought it undemocratic to have a system that systematically kept 20% of the population out of Parliament.<br/>We enjoyed our time in Turkey. People friendly and pleasant. The streets safe &amp; clean with little police presence. Many small business people were Kurds, &amp; none expressed sympathy for a Kurdish state in Turkey.  Why they asked, would we limit ourselves to a small country of 20 million when we have the whole Turkish nation of 75 million, of which we've been a part forever?<br/>By fomenting division in Turkey by bombing Kurdish positions in Iraq, who just happen to be the most effective American allies on the ground fighting &amp; displacing ISIS, &amp; by arresting Kurds trumped up charges, Erdogan is hoping to deter liberal Turks from voting HDP. Why is NATO condoning this?

807
Jon provided some of the best and most honest news on TV.  During the dark years right after 9-11 when people feared saying anything against US politics, it was Jon Stewart who shined light on what was truly going on (e.g., trumped up reason for going to war with Iraq, etc.).  <br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed with the article by Koblin as he really did not articulate what the Daily Show with Jon meant for so many people who felt alienated by the corporate news of the day.  Also as a point of fact, the rally Jon and Stephen held in 2010 attracted a quarter of million people, not thousands. 

808
No mention at all of my favorite candidate, Rand Paul. I had high hopes for his libertarian stace winning out. But he's lost in the crowd. <br/><br/>Oh well, whoever wins the nomination I'll be voting for them. I'm part of the ABC group -- Anybody But Clinton. Except for Donald Trump. If he's nominated, Hillary gets my vote. Even she trumps Trump. 

809
@TPierre: not quite.  It is highly unlikely that a deal that would satisfy Netanyahu would ever be acceptable to the Iranians.  Your fantasy that there is some "better deal" that could be achieved is likely just that--fantasy.    Not only that, you sound eerily similar to all the GOP naysayers who continually trash Obama but fail to provide any better solutions on a range of issues--economic recovery, funding the government, immigration, global warming, etc etc etc... Sorry, but we just ain't buying it.   Non-existent fantasy solutions do not trump real solutions that get the job done despite being imperfect.  <br/><br/>And as to your statement that Netanyahu understands peace...?  Um, methinks not, since the area he governs is mighty short of that.... 

810
Seriously? They took them to task? No, the moderators tried to smear trump and carsens and then asked truly meaningless, pointless questions to the others and allowed the candidates to give their own speeches. It was great theater but not a debate and nothing to admire. 

811
"But they have not publicly and explicitly defined their group in a way that clearly excludes him."<br/><br/>I very much agree. Many articles promoted by John Hawkin's media group (e.g <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2015/08/05/donald-trump-still-right-about-mexican-rapists-n2035312" title="http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2015/08/05/donald-trump-still-right-about-mexican-rapists-n2035312" target="_blank">http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2015/08/05/donald-trump-still-...</a> ) definitely support this observation. It's all about who is against the outsider (terrorists; Mexicans; etc). A 'free market' as its own political platform just doesn't sell itself the way it used to since the collapse of the USSR and Lehman.

812
Shhhhhh.. That will be Trump's "trump card"  the interference Jerbus caused when he circumvented the law with the help of daddy's hand picked Scotus .<br/><br/>We have Jebus to thank for 9/11, the Iraq / Afghanistan wars, the great recession and so much more.<br/><br/>If you think Trump was relentless in getting Obama to produce his birth certificate wait until he demands that those election results get properly counted.

813
In the first debate Carly Fiorina was the clear winner.  She was poised, articulate, and perhaps because she has no political record, she didn't try to rush through a list of her political accomplishments; instead she attempted to articulate a partial vision for the future. In the prime time debate I completely disagree with Mr. Bruni's statement that Trump lost.  While it's true that his responses were, for the most part, pure "trumpery." he was successful in using the same combative and controversial style that propelled him to the leading position in the polls. It should be very interesting to see if he maintains this position now that the first debate is over.  I also thought that Cruz and Rubio provided articulate and well reasoned responses to the sometimes abrasive questions.  I was hoping that Jeb Bush would give me something to cheer about, but some of his answers were clearly evasive and not well stated (e.g., his attempt to smooth over his previous support for the common core curriculum).  At times, he had the forlorn look of the proverbial deer in the headlights.  I thought the losers were Rand Paul and Ben Carson both of whom are not ready for prime time.  Kasich, Huckabee, Christie, and Walker all did well enough to advance, so the next debate should tell us even more about their presidential potential.

814
I see trump as gaining supporters, not losing them.

815
Classic Krugman! I agree completely with PK's analysis of the situation. Most liberals think that trump leading in the polls helps the democrats, and it probably does, but it has the negative effect of making the other 16 extremist republicans running for president look moderate by comparison in the eyes of the gullible press which is unfortunate.

816
I don't disagree with anything you say, but it should be pointed out that the freak show that rallies support &amp; gullibility among Republican voters also motivates Democratic voters to support a candidate they don't like just to save themselves from insanity.  Certainly nothing Ms. Clinton is apt to do will motivate them.  The phony differences between Trump and the other Republicans that the media is trumpeting now, is just a precursor of the phony differences they will trumpet between Clinton &amp; the Republican nominee next year.  The purpose is to prevent any engagement with serious candidates like Mr. Sanders ("serious" in the sense of, well, "serious," as opposed to vetted by the 2 parties &amp; their media).

817
demagogue  trump brings up issues that effect everyone  he is making an impact but I am not sure what he would do as president

818
"Donald Trump suggest shutting down Government over planned parenthood"<br/><br/>This article was shocking to read and to understand how something like this is going on. In the article Donald Trump suggested he supported shutting down the Federal government to stop funding for planned parenthood in the wake of videos that show officials with the group discussing fees for tissue and body parts from aborted fetuses.  I agree with Donald Trump.  Planned parenthood should be shut down no matter what. The tax payers should not be paying for any abortions in or out of the United States. Abortion is a murder for profit business that needs to be shut down completely. Donald trump is never afraid to speak his mind.  He shared with us his proposal to stop planned parenthood immediately. Donald trump wants the Republicans to hold President Obama's feet to the fire, and make it known that the GOP is willing to shut down the government if spending bill-which must be passed by October. The GOP have a winning issue and should shut down this criminal enterprise. The planned parenthood have lied about what they do and got caught. The ones involved with selling body parts should be arrested. 

819
Suicide on Campus and the Pressure of Perfection<br/><br/>As a teenager/young adult, this is absolutely one of the most stressful aspects of my life. Academics is held in such a high regard to my parents and anything short of excellence is not tolerated. <br/><br/>There is a trend that is presenting itself in society. Stress and anxiety is commonplace among people my age. With aims to get into prestigious schools, achieve the highest GPA's, and trump their "competition", students such as myself are headbutting a desk when these goals are not met with success. My expectations are set so high by my parents that they purposely did not insert any money into a savings account for my education, as they believe that I should be able to attend a college, (even more so, an expensive  and prestigious one), solely on scholarships. As you can imagine, my mindset in regards to my school work is do-or-die. And the amount of stress laid upon me may very well lead me to the latter. <br/><br/>This attitude of maturing quick and early is disturbing to me, because our youth is wasted on our worries of our prospects for the future. People my age are told it is being "prepared" or "proactive", but if we just keep working for the future, what will there be for us to look back on? I was taught that affliction in one's mind and soul is only the fruit of hard work and should be embraced. "For whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap". What will there be to sow if the crops have already drowned?

820
FOX News  set up the GOP lovefest, trump delivers the viewers.   I don't believe, in the two hours, the word "climate" was uttered once.

The reason that the Toronto Star is the best newspaper in North America to read about and understand American politics is that its theatre critic covered last night's debate. I have read a number of comments but the Theatre critic really gets it.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in-us-republican-presidential-debate.html" title="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in-us-republican-presidential-debate.html" target="_blank">http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in...</a>

823
Why PK  can't make sense of the current situation despite reading the background articles is beyond me. Lets take as fact that the economics and what is being said by the right is off the deep end and makes no  sense. So, how do you make sense of that. Lets take as another fact that we live in an oligarchy, and that. we also  know 22% of Americans think the bible is the literal world of god, and that on some issues (abortion/ guns) the vote will be republican no matter what is said in other areas. Right away you know 22% of the vote will believe anything, so it does not matter what you say. Add the single issue folks and you have a high enough % to be competitive. The oligarchy wants only certain people, they can hit a home run (Romney) or get a nice triple (Obama). The goal for them is to make Trump seem valid (hone run) while being very happy with H. Clinton. Everyone fearing trump (as predicted) votes Clinton (giving the oligarch 85% of what they want) while the voters feel they won because they dodged the Donald. It makes rational sense for the republicans to be off the deep end (they don't need to actually win) they still get what they want (clinton win) while the public remains satisfied. The NYtimes plays it's role in the dance via it's slanted Bernie Sanders coverage convincing people he isn't viable, and the oligarchy wins again via clinton. the Romney candidacy  after the financial  crisis showed this theme

824
How have we come to this?!<br/><br/>The Party that has made it their sacred duty to block, demonize, demoralize, and debase Obama has opened a new chapter of the absurd, vile, and indefensible.  Not only have they put up a list of radical candidates that combine, stunning obtuseness, a long list of mediocre achievements, and just plain unsuitability to the role, they have now turned their own party's vetting process into a circuis of mockery, boorishness, and, well... trumpery.<br/><br/>Some of them have lists of failure to their name that would cause many to wince.  Others opine on whether the potential equivalent of starting WWIII should occur on their first day in office, or if they should wait awhile.  One wants to send in US troops to block abortions - a procedure that is *still legal* across the nation. One presided over one of the greatest corporate disasters in recent decades<br/><br/>The winner so far: the most outrageous, clownish braggart of them all!  God help us!<br/><br/>Tell me again why Obama is such a bad President, or why Hilary would be almost as bad... Anyone?

825
Nope, you are not the only one. <a href="http://forwardeconomics.net/2015/07/05/trump-presidency/" title="http://forwardeconomics.net/2015/07/05/trump-presidency/" target="_blank">http://forwardeconomics.net/2015/07/05/trump-presidency/</a>

Germans, like many Europeans, realize and understand the necessity of societal responsibility and thus actions (laws, regulations, etc.) that benefit the whole, not the few.  This is not to say those in the minority are marginalized, but it is to say that an individual's right does not necessarily trump the right of society, e.g., gun ownership.<br/><br/>This really is a comparison of apples to oranges.

827
And for trump that was polite.

828
This particular type of delusion did really come of age with Ronald Reagan.  We in California who had watched him dismantle a great state really could not believe that people listened to him.  It was all meanness, xenophobia, hate for anyone out of the tribe.<br/><br/>Now comes trump, who has profited through the bankruptcies of others, who has mistreated thousands and thousands of employees and laughs about it.  Ask Chris Christie about Trumps NJ history - that would be a decent idea - if any of these repub voters were remotely interested in facts, history, honesty or the future of a once decent country.

829
are the american people really supposed to believe that every foreign leader and every foreign terrorist NEVER make a mistake or miscalculate or have anything go wrong, while no american leader ever gets anything right? trump's grass-is-greener view of the rest of the world obviously lacks balance, perspective and truth.

830
Mr. Bruni says that Mr. Trump "never quite recovered" after being asked a tough question about his loyalty, yet the lead story on the Times website is headlined:  "Trump Steals the Show, Mixing Politics and Pizazz."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/us/politics/donald-trump-steals-the-show-mixing-politics-and-pizazz.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/us/politics/donald-trump-steals-the-show-mixing-politics-and-pizazz.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/us/politics/donald-trump-steals-the-sh...</a><br/><br/>Somebody's obviously getting it very wrong.

831
trump keeps talking about what a great negotiator and deal maker he is, but exactly what negotiations is he talking about?

832
There's a few things I can't help liking about Mr Trump:<br/><br/>He can change his mind<br/>He is not politically correct<br/>He's a successful business man<br/>He is not fooled by political journalists<br/><br/>Unfortunately , these admirable qualities are 'trumped' by his neocon, lunatic tendencies. 

833
If you click on the link to Foreign Policy Initiative they are trumpeting their opinion on the Iran deal on the Eternal Word Network. Enough said. 

834
It seems contradictory to say the individual trumps all while the oligarchs rule. The power in Europe may rest with governments while the concentration of power here in the United States more and more rests with the Oligarchs and the politicians they buy.<br/><br/>Choose your Master. Choose wisely! Citizens United needs to be overturned but as Justice Scalia points out that task is daunting... <a href="http://lstrn.us/R6K4M2" title="http://lstrn.us/R6K4M2" target="_blank">http://lstrn.us/R6K4M2</a>

Walker and Rubio believe an embryo trumps the life of the woman carrying it. Cruz believes we would benefit by having a dictator like Sisi. Huckabee reiterated his desire for a theocracy when he reminded us that the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being. Bush bragged about defunding Planned Parenthood in Florida, leaving many women there with no healthcare whatsoever. Trump warned Megyn Kelly to cool it or he'd insult her too. For most of the night I thought I was watching Saturday Night Live. 

836
I watched less than one minute of the debate, as I expected - from what little I saw - that the candidates would duck the hard questions and substantive issues.  But I trust Mr. Bruni, and I feel I learned from him all I need to know about the debate, and I learned in in far less than 2 hours.<br/><br/>Mr. Bruni made the astute observation that Fox News would be the best cable network to nail down the candidates on specific facts and issues.  I made (and hereby announce) this equally astute observation:  Fox News is the public relations arm of the Republican establishment.  Its purpose in making the debate meaningful is to weaken The Donald, leaving room for an establishment Republican to win the party's nomination.  The only wild care in the deck is. of course, The Donald, and I cannot see how Fox News can trump him.

837
The Toronto Star Trumped every newspaper in the US by having its theater critic cover the Presidential Forum. Only a theatre critic could do justice to last nights presentation.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in-us-republican-presidential-debate.html" title="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in-us-republican-presidential-debate.html" target="_blank">http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in...</a> 

838
That Nate Cohn coos the 'good performance' of Scott Walker for handling a tough question on abortion is an insult to his readers. <br/><br/>Walker, in his scramble to come out on top of the clown pile, is unapologetic in his view that fetal sanctity trumps the heath (or life) of a woman at all costs and under any circumstance. Such categorical arrogance and dictative myopia should be a clarion call for all women - despite party affiliation - to take their vote more seriously that Walker takes their lives. The same might also be said when considering Trump's unrepentant misogyny.

839
Shiny new trump was the only one on stage that is NOT a paid for and controlled corrupt politician  That was obvious when the bought media attempted to discredit him . He is our only hope of breaking out of this Washington  corruption

840
look, trump is a clown, but you, frank, are worse.<br/><br/>"And thus, in the first minute of the debate, Trump was undressed and unmasked, and he stood there as the unprincipled, naked egomaniac that he is. He never quite recovered. His admission of political infidelity was the prism through which all of his subsequent bluster had to be viewed."<br/><br/>this is simply despicable.  it's also utterly wrong.  what you are saying here is "loyalty to party uber alles".  how can you possibly claim that someone who stand by his or her views and refuses to kowtow to to a majority is unprincipled?  just what principles are you lionizing here?  dedication to membership in a gang?  seriously, what color is the sky on your world?<br/><br/>you, sir, embody EXACTLY what is wrong with our politics.  this is the "with me or against me" thinking that has turned the debate between team donkey and team elephant into the crips and the bloods.  you embody unprincipled gang warfare.  our side must win, who cares how!  THAT, sir, is what is unprincipled.  <br/><br/>while i do not agree with trump, i do support his right to stand by his beliefs and laud willingness to stand up the the party bullies.  if both sides had more of that, politics in this country might actually work.

841
It is a sign of the corruption of our culture that an ideological hack such as Stewart should be celebrated as he is as "truth teller", when his only real talent is to play to the prejudices of his audience.<br/><br/>His maudlin and brainless treatment of the Ferguson business was emblematic of his preening moralizing trumping any shred of deliberate thought or concern for the truth.<br/><br/>Was there a single skeptical thought expressed by the man over the obvious flaws in the narrative when this story broke? Where was any skepticism to be found in him over the "hands raised, don't shoot" claim? How about all the many other accounts that turned out to be utterly false?<br/><br/>No, the man simply jumped on the idiot narrative bandwagon and intoned solemnly his Daily Sermons, to his enraptured audience.  And did he utter any apologies when even the Obama DOJ conceded that the best evidence was that Darren Wilson acted in self defense? Of course not.<br/><br/>Truth?<br/><br/>Hah!

From abroad I sit in a good place to gauge reaction and sift through the fog of a nascent campaign. Given Trump's past and present coziness with the Clintons, it appears that they have struck some deal with him. Remember, there would be no Clinton presidency if billionaire (sound familiar?) Ross Perot had not siphoned votes from Bush 41. I think this is the game-plan all along for trump and Hillary. Donating heavily to Bill Clinton and then to Hillary, as well as their foundation,Trump's bona fides are suspect. If he can poll even 7-10% of the electorate, Hillary's election is assured. Game over.

843
I think it's funny.  It was hard to watch this debate when they started out with the huge inconsistency between wanting candidates who buck the establishment GOP, then demanding a loyalty oath from them.  Republicans just love loyalty oaths. Megyn Kelly tries to attack Trump on this and fails.  Republicans are soooo dumb.<br/><br/>So Trump trumps again.  If you want someone who challenges the established party, why demand that he or she take a loyalty oath to the established party?  Right off the bat the GOP establishment has 16 of its 17 ducks aligned to the establishment but Trump successfully bucks them and becomes the demonstrated sole representative for changing the GOP establishment.  He has stolen the platform from all of the other candidates.<br/><br/>Unreal.

844
I am truly surprised to see Mr. Brooks, in the nuclear age, unabashedly embrace the theory of realpolitik. More, I'd have thought that in bringing up Vietnam and Iraq, he'd have at least mentioned, as an aside, something about what constitutes a just war. After all, though he's too timid to say it, it's war he's calling for here.<br/><br/>That Vietnam was a tragically pointless war, based on Cold War theories about dominoes falling, and that it ended with 60,000 Americans and millions of dead Vietnamese dead, doesn't matter. Nor does it matter that the Iraq invasion led to 4,500 dead Americans, hundreds of thousands of wounded American soldiers, and over a million dead Iraqi civilians (and counting). Or that the invasion led directly to the enormous power vacuum in Iraq that caused the mess we now face.  On Mr. Brooks's account, it's not relevant that the Iraqi war was based on  trumped up "facts" and appallingly ignorant foreign policy, So what. America was supposed to win that war no matter what.<br/><br/>Does Mr. Brooks get it that we are hated in the Middle East--by just about everyone except, ironically, for the more than 60 percent of Iranians who are under 30 years old, and are decidedly open toward America? <br/><br/>The treaty is a good one--not a perfect one--precisely because those young people in Iran will take power during the next 10 years. Too bad for them. Israel and its supporters, ready to act now, are beating the drums for war right now.

845
Yada, yada, yada about reform Jews, secular Jews, etc. None of them, repeat, none of them dare to disagree with the Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox in public. It would be bad polices to do so and as we know, tolerating hate bias and death trumps ethics in Israel.  This from a country that is so proud not to be as biased and murderous as Arab countries. Great! Any surprise that the Israel Lobby inspired the pre-emptive strike on Iraq and now wants MORE!  Oppose, we haven't totally avenged the Holocaust yet so we have to keep killing our enemies. No profiles of courage in the promised land.

846
I have a hard time comprehending perspectives like this about trump.  Saying mexico and china are winning and we are losing is not a policy recomendation.  Beating the drum of "our politicians are stupid and cant negotiate" without giving a single policy recomendation or giving an actual example of what he is talking about reminds me of how a child tatle-tales on a peer.  The man inherited a multi million dollar estate and was a milti-millionaire- (est between 50-75 million) before he was 30, given to him by his father.  I don't understand how this is impressive or "american".  Going to the negotiating table by saying ill buy you out and or push you out of business if you dont do what I want, backed by an inherited slush fund, doesnt qualify you to be president.

I am a Canadian who watched a different leadership debate last night and woke up this morning with a very swelled head. I am uncomfortable draping myself in a flag and extolling the virtues of a country where through no fault of my own I was born.<br/>The NYT would do well to take note that Canada's paper of record had the wisdom to have its theater critic cover the spectacle in Cleveland. the Toront Star's coverage of the GOP forum seems to capture the moment as only a professional theatre critic can.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in-us-republican-presidential-debate.html" title="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in-us-republican-presidential-debate.html" target="_blank">http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/06/donald-trump-scores-big-in...</a>

848
It was a capitalistic spectacle by Trump who followed in the footsteps of the rich like Bloomberg whose empire grew exponentially as a result of public office and all the free brand name exposure that came with it. If I were trump, I wouldn't care if I lost as long as I became even richer with all the free advertising. Trump is no fool. He learned from Bloomberg, another NY rich guy.

849
For Republicans, the certainty and control of death today "trumps" the uncertainty and lack of control involved in trusting "other" humans.............and it's not just about nuclear weapons, it's about anything that could threaten their personal certainty and control over every aspect life on the planet (including yours)!<br/><br/>"Survival of the fittest" requires marginalization (at the very least) and elimination (at the very worst) of those "others" who are designated among the  "unfittest"............and there can never be a fittest without an unfittest; if there was, we simply wouldn't need the word!

850
Not true. Hillary has essentially done nothing but serve her country. All accusations are trumped up misogyny.

851
In more important news, last night Senator Chuck Schumer became a turncoat, joining the Republican party in opposing the deal with Iran, thus paving the path to another war. This shameful betrayal of his party "trumped" the significance of the circus show on Fox.

852
Walker a B-? You grade high.  Trump is... well Trump ... as in trumpery. Kasich makes as much sense as any of them, but the Republican Party has lost its collective mind and I could not in good conscience vote for any of these people for any office.

853

854
Get rid of Schumer. Vote him out of office. He is a threat to world peace. He obviously isn't a very deep thinker.<br/><br/>We do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons; why does Schumer want Iran to have both the motivation and means to get them? Why would he side with the Iranian, Israeli, and American hard-liners who get traction from the persistence of war and the threat of war?<br/><br/>The consequence of the failure of diplomacy is that such hard-liners will be free to trumpet their primitive and paranoid mantra:  "Arm for war!" This is what sustains the Ayatollahs against a populace that would like to westernize and modernize, that creates a backward-looking type of support for Netanyahu (in whose sway Schumer seems to be held), and for Republicans who want the military-industrial complex ever to expand and to deepen those companies' support for a fear-mongering GOP.

855
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. The voters in Kansas re-elected Brownback and his legislative wrecking crew after seeing - and presumably not caring about - the damage done to the social, educational and physical infrastructure of the state. When it comes to civilization, you get what you pay for, and apparently a majority of Kansans don't want to pay anything. What are we outsiders to conclude? That the irrational loathing for everything government does (apart from providing farm subsidies of course) is greater than the desire for a healthy, well-educated citizenry? That personal gain trumps any concept of the common weal? The notion that businesses will want to relocate to a state that has legislated itself down to corn-fueled equivalent of a banana republic is ludicrous. As their state founders, Kansans are getting precisely what they voted for - and deserve.

856
Scary, really, that Brownback et al are working so very hard to create a more regressive tax structure.  Ideology and benighted Common Sense (which has taught such truths as a universe centered on a flat earth) trump an educated policy based on economic theory and facts.

857
It appears once again that pressure from the Jewish-American right (not to mention the current Israeli government) has led to a political cave-in.   Either that, or Senator Schumer should now be numbered among those Americans whose loyalty to Israel trumps their loyalty to America.  The United States is justified in defending Israel's right to exist, but that commitment does not and should not extend to knee-jerk support for whatever policy Israel chooses to pursue.  <br/><br/>While the proposed agreement with Iran may be imperfect from the U.S. point of view, that is invariably the outcome of any hard-fought negotiation, and this was an extraordinarily difficult one.  For opponents to argue that the U.S. didn't get everything it could have wanted is both impractical and immature.  Only time will tell whether the new inspections regime is working, but sanctions can always be reimposed, and the U.S. (and Israel) continue to possess a massive military advantage.  In the meantime, relaxation of sanctions and normalization of trade relations create the best incentive for Iranian leaders and the Iranian public to realize that it is in their national interest to comply fully with the agreement.

858
GOTTA HAMMER  Just because you have a hammer it doesn't mean that problem is a nail.  Likewise, just because you've got taxes it doesn't mean that the answer to every problem is a cut.  The notion that one-size-fits-all as legislative dogma is worse than dumb.  It's highly destructive.  I can tell you from living in Pennsylvania during Corbett's indiscriminate tax cuts.  Since he had signed Grover Norquist's "no new tax" pledge and he was intent upon taking a wrecking ball to PA's social programs, the fact that the Marcellus Shale was thought to be a trillion dollar business did not sway him from his "pledge."  As a result, we're living with the wreckage he created.  It's a classic example of how to give away the store to the 1% and screw the 99%.  Now, Tom Wolf is taxing the extraction of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale.  PA is beginning to grow again.  But it's going to take a long time to rebuild the social programs that the last governor destroyed.  What happened in PA during Corbett's time is proof positive of GOP ideology trumping reason and good governance.  In some ways, Brownback seems to be cut from the same cloth.  Kansas, please accept my deepest condolences.

859
This is an exercise in academic, sanctimonious narcissism.  It's one thing to have an ethics code that bans involvement in some kinds of forced interrogation.  It's another thing to claim that one is above any kind of involvement in national security issues.  We are all in the same boat when it comes to threats to national security, and for a subset of self-involved psychologists to claim that their simple-minded notions of ethical purity trump the common good is not only intellectually lazy, but morally reprehensible. 

860
It's not the Question about legacy. It's the question about the the neocons who drive the trumpet to attack Iran. The voice of reason and sanity seems to be falling on deaf years. Democrats are supposed to be grownups.. But looks like whatever the version of insecurity that the Jews are feeling Is the the only version of the truth that exists in this Universe? <br/><br/>Is Israel suggesting to attach Iran to stop from developing a Nuclear Weapon?  In that case what happens to the insecurity of the MODERATE Iranians? IS WAR THE ONLY OPTION.. 

861
The Donald did not steal the show.  He showed himself up for what he is: a self-important loudmouth with no sense.<br/><br/>He admitted at the very start of the "debate" that he is not a team player.  How does he ever expect to get 535 prima donnas in Congress to do anything that he asks?<br/><br/>He obviously has misogenistic tendencies.  Many women will not vote for him, EVER.<br/><br/>He lied about his bankruptcies when they were brought up.<br/>Link: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html?hpid=z1" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html?hpid=z1" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-abou...</a><br/><br/>Other than that, he said nothing substantive.

Chuck makes me proud to be a Brooklynite! Why should party loyalty trump common sense. Obama caved on every point, but Chuck didnt cave to Obama. I see many liberal Jewish Dems lining up to attack him. When will Jewish voter get over their guilt trip and start voting using their common sense. Obama, Pelosi, et al are no friend of Isreal, our great ally. And it case you are wondering, I am a GOY! 100 percent!

864
We need a voice like Trump. All of us who are middle class tax payers are fed up with special interests running the politicians who have grown government to a ridiculous level with our hard earned money, and borrowed even more. An 18 trillion dollar debt is a criminal outrage.<br/>The Donald should have told Megyn - after his quip about Rosie and his misogyny being entertainment - that what the country needs is smart, aggressive women like you Megyn, and similar men, with business experience, brains, and a willingness to make hard decisions void of special interest influence. That would have inspired massive applause.<br/>Likewise Chris Wallace tried to indict trump for his bankruptcies. Trump had a good answer, he took billions from bankers not babies and children - but he should have continued, and reminded everyone the U.S. Is nearing bankruptcy and will need someone like him to deal with it. It is a convincing point of view.<br/>Perhaps Trump is less socially skilled - though I've met him several times and find him to be polite, interesting, and grounded - but any candidate not beholden to lobbyists and other unelected influence and pac money is a good candidate in the current climate of over the top pork barrel spending, corruption, and ineffective government. "The people of the United States" are all fed up with ineffective, self important , bloated governance. Let's truly make America great again.

Poverty, food insufficiency, poor sanitation, religious extremism and war will trump chili peppers every time.

I confess to the smugness of believing that only knaves and fools would  deny climate change is caused by human activity, conspire to deny voting rights to blacks and other minorities, want to create constitutional rights for zygots which trump even the life of their mother, deny racism was a founding principle of our country, and want to put a gun the hand of everyone.   This is especially so because each one of these positions inevitably leads to either greater profits for the rich or greater power for the white male power structure.<br/>   In an environment in which monied interests are funding disinformation campaigns, people like John Stewart are vital to exposing the lies and hypocrisy which animate these assaults on common sense. To be sure, civility is desirable, but "respecting" nonsense by pretending it is anything other than that does not advance rational discourse, it prevents it.  To put it concretely, we can debate whether cap and trade (a conservative means to reducing emissions) or a carbon tax (a liberal means) is the better policy.  But we can't waste time debating the human role in climate change, a well established fact.<br/>John Stewart's targets were well chosen and fair.  James should not be cowed by Mr. Alexander,  a defender and apparently a fan of John Yoo who wrote the memo authorizing waterboarding torture by simply redefining torture to not include it.  Prison, not on television, is where Mr. Yoo and his sophistry belongs. 

867
The original word "liberal" meant that one can view reality as it exists sans predisposition. This is a difficult. Then the upper case Liberal meant the ability for humanity often through the assistance of governmental via social policies and  interventions to achieve a greater degree of perfection. Aka, progressivism.<br/><br/>The basic tenets of the conservative movement talks about "original sin" (literally or as a metaphor) and says that we are born as a flawed species and there are limits as to how much positive change is possible.<br/><br/>Yes, both positions are viable and must be recognized. Both diametrical sides must be recognized,<br/><br/>But, as the GOP and the Democrats evolved both became corned into a kind of xenophobic stance. Liberals thought all could be righted via the government. Conservatives thought Washington was the problem.<br/><br/>But, post WFB, Goldwater, Reagan came the uneducated and unwashed: people like Sarah Celebrity, all supported by Koch, Murdoch and their friends at fox for self serving reasons.<br/><br/>How one can view the 2012 and the present GOP primary debate with a straight face is beyond me. Yes, sometimes one argument completely trumps its opposition. Jon Stewart just looked at the clown cars and saw, in the main, idiocy. So. if he was wrongly biased it was taking the side of a round Earth position vs.the Flat Earth Society.<br/><br/>Stewart's fault was his not including dysfunctional cultural diversity  and a full appreciation of legitimate conservative ideology.

868
Mr. Alexander's piece illustrates that the "facts have a well known liberal bias."  Mr. Alexander's prime example -- defending John Yoo, an active conspirator in war crimes -- demonstrates the bankruptcy of Alexander's piece.  John Yoo wrote a memo redefining torture to not include water boarding and other techniques that were out and out torture;  no amount of Mr. Yoo's considerable debating skills or Stewart's supposed lack of preparation changes those facts.<br/>I confess to the smugness of believing that only knaves and fools would  deny climate change is caused by human activity, conspire to deny voting rights to blacks and other minorities, want to create constitutional rights for zygots which trump even the life of their mother, deny racism was a founding principle of our country, and want to put a gun the hand of everyone are knaves and fools.   This is especially so because each one of these positions inevitably leads to either greater profits for the rich or greater power for the white male power structure.<br/>    To criticize John Stewart for exposing the hypocrisy and stupidity of the right is like attacking a thermometer for accurately giving temperature readings. There are to be sure legitimate differences in approaches of how to solve problems on which conservatives may have something useful to say.  But they spend the overwhelming amount of their energy on denying reality, not fixing problems. 

869
Oh, Mr. Alexander, Jon Stewart absolutely "comprehended" conservatives, especially those who don't make an effort to keep in touch with reality.  If, as you say, Sarah Palin and Todd Akin don't represent the mainstream of conservative thinking, then which conservatives dared to disagree with their statements or policy prescriptions?  Scott Walker is still claiming rape is not a legitimate reason for a woman to seek a legal medical procedure to end a pregnancy.  Despite the evidence Marco Rubio would like us to believe he agrees.<br/><br/>From the viewpoint of this "smug liberal with a sense of intellectual and moral superiority" it has always seemed that my conservative friends expect the world to conform to their ideas, their ideology and their moral codes based on a religion most of the world doesn't believe in.  A conservative's idea of compromise occurs when a liberal takes less than a minute to bow down and agree with him. Expecting a smart comic such as Mr. Stewart to think his mission was to help liberals become "more open to dialog" with conservatives was expecting hope would trump (no pun intended) experience.<br/><br/>I assume most of this article was satire, especially the description of the Yoo interview.  Mr. Stewart, as most of his audience appreciated, was first of all a fine comedian who sought truth and not a truth seeker who happened to be a world class comedian.<br/><br/>Small minds envy what they cannot be.  There is a reason no conservatives are comedians as good as Jon Stewart.

870
Mr. Alexander is not, in any way, suggesting that the caricatures that you point to are truly representative of conservatism; however, that is what makes it in the media world today and for the last 20 years or so. The vitriol spewed by these caricatures pervades both ends of the political spectrum where reason is trumped by zealotry. When you are a zealot, your beliefs are a suit of armor impervious to reason. The best thing the Daily Show has done is to compare what proponents say in the moment and prior to that moment which is nothing more than decent journalism.

871
i used to think i knew the difference between satire and news. but it was news, not satire, that reported republicans wearing band aids with a heart drawn on them in purple to the 2004 republican convention as if winning a purple heart in battle were not something they would admire. and when donald trump said mccain was not a war hero, he was carrying on a republican tradition fully within the memory of most people now.

872
Yeah, but Reagen rode horses and played with guns. One can pretend he's a Texas cowboy.<br/>No facts or reasoning can trump that.

873
Even NYT has acknowledged that Perot didn't put Clinton in the White House: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ross-perot-myth-reborn-amid-rumors-third-party-trump-candidacy" title="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ross-perot-myth-reborn-amid-rumors-third-party-trump-candidacy" target="_blank">http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ross-perot-myth-reborn-amid-rumors-third-part...</a><br/><br/>Since Trump is likely to stick around for awhile, it would be a good idea to avoid resurrecting the myth in your news coverage. 

874
The Republican party continues to be "trumped".The latest "Donald"incident reveals a certain irony in the media buzz over Carly Fiorina. Despite her gratuitous tweet censoring Donald Trump for his remarks last night about Megan Kelly, she has been a willing participant in the Republican political misogyny.She  attacked Hillary Clinton for her support of Planned Parenthood. PPH services well over a million Americans. It  gives women agency and needed medical care.The Republicans are cynically using a selectively edited, out of context video, produced by a misogynistic radical anti-abortion group, to defund P.P.H.and continue Fiorina's and the Republican war on women.<br/><br/>Fiorina failed miserably as a C.E.O.She dismissed 30,000 workers.She was fired and received an enormous golden parachute. Carly Fiorina is the living metaphor for income inequality.When she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010 Barbara Boxer defeated her by 1 million votes.She owed half a million dollars in wages to the 2010 campaign staff and consultants until January 2015. She settled those debts just before she announced her current campaign.Her record on women's issues, C.E.O. failures, and as millionaire campaign debt deadbeat, would seem to be reason enough to tone down the Carly Fiorina hype.

875
There are signs of sail power returning to commercial shipping. And steamships were a good example of convenience trumping performance. The clippers of the 19th century were much, much faster than the steamships that displaced them, and could travel much, much farther without visiting a harbour (to take on coal for the steam engine).

876
Trump is a bully, a clown as well, but at his heart a bully with serious character flaws. That anger his taps is half wrong and half unproductive. Being mad doesn't solve anything. And the Republican Party particularly at the national level has created and promoted this mindless anger without direction. There are no reasonable options being presented or advanced just against everything. The anger lacks maturity and there is no one on the planet better able to lead the immature than trump.<br/><br/>But the Republican Party has no one but themselves to blame for trump. He is citizens united's unlimited Role for the rich.<br/><br/>A bully with bad ideas who exploits everything for his own personal gain: the modern republican has replaced the very missed moderate republican that helped build this nation even as a minirity party. Think of it as the majority party with anger at their core they accomplish less than their moderate and reasonable earlier versions.

877
I don't know how every new thing he says surprises me, but somehow it does. I don't really understand how people are rallying around a man who seems to say and do whatever he wants just because he can. Come on, America, this is not our man. What if trump insults a leader or another country? Nations have gone to war for less, and at the very least this kind of talk could seriously strain relations with foreign states. This man does not and cannot represent the American people to the rest of the world. 

878
U.S. Congressmen cannot serve two masters:  US Constitution or Netanyahu's (or any foreign) government.  When religious, ancestral and or ethnic affiliations trump their doing what is best for all in this country we are doomed as a Union.<br/><br/>Who is it they expect to be the warriors put forth in defense of their sects? Senator Schumer and others may as well say to US service persons to go forth and fight for Israel.  I am an Israeli supporter, but not its citizen and obviously  I didn't' know it was Schumer was either; he has failed the John F Kennedy Catholic Pope test.<br/>I am equally disturbed by Republicans who place the potential of USA war and peace at behest of campaign funds - wha price loyalty?  I am much closer to end of life then it's beginning, thus I don't worry to speak these matters.  <br/><br/>Those siding in this intrusion of US sovereignty should be concerned about future potential overseas influences directed against their side..<br/>At this point I don't think this senator can be trusted to objectively represent US interest as the potential Democrat majority/minority leader with appearances of being at beck and call of Netanyahu's Knesset.  <br/><br/>What if this matter of war and peace involved decisions of a Senator with affiliations with some other nation - What would your reactions be to him?

879
<br/>I emailed the following to Senator Schumer yesterday morning:<br/><br/>"I understand you have a Jewish problem.  I am part of it.<br/><br/>Israel and its lobbyists have for too long had control of US actions in the Middle East.  Though I support Israel, I believe their influence has made any solutions insoluble.  The President has taken judicious and courageous actions to give peace a chance.  I understand the constituent pressure you must be under.  But, politics must not trump pragmatism.  I have admired and supported your stance on most issues.  You have the ability now to take a leading role in history--or not."<br/><br/>Later that evening he chose cowardice.  Extraordinary cowardice by releasing his statement after the Republican debate and during the Jon Stewart farewell--on the chance that no one would notice.

880
I don't think that is the case. It is quite clear the republican party doesn't want trump participating and fox was trying to help out. Trump was the only one at the debate to face difficult questions aside from Carsen.<br/>If Kelly's personal views are different than fox news, she has done a poor job of demonstrating that. I would also question the morality of someone who would spew the hate that she has if they did not believe it. 

881
the whole clown train is packed with monsters, don't insult the trumpster.

882
"Soon the USA will be just like the rest of the 3rd world..."<br/><br/>Yes, the confirmation of this descent might very well be to have a caudillo, a deluded strongman and populist, a demagogue as head of state.<br/><br/>A staple of a third world country is to have politicians that believe their own petulance, that require adoration from the governed, with a personality cult trumping fact and decency. Frankly, Mr. Trump fully fits the mold.

883
What if trump insults a leader or another country?<br/>--------------------<br/>Then his approval ratings will soar.  "Monsieur Hollande, is that you under that motorcycle helmet, visiting your secret girlfriend again?"   We know who wears the pants in the Hollande atelier.

884
I am no trump fan but it is obvious that Fox wanted him out.<br/>Megan Kelly and Chris Wallace did a job on him in the debate.They repeatedly went after him after he finished talking -something they didn't do to anyone else.<br/>What about Wallace smirking uncontrollably when he thought he had Trump caught in the bankruptcy question.<br/>Finally as to Megan Kelly accusation about what Trump said on his TV show-This was awful journalism. How or why should he explain a comment that was probably written for him? If Fox is going to hold actors accountable for what they say on their TV shows,maybe we should hold Reagan accountable for  statements made in Bedtime for Bonzo.

885
Ms. Kelly  was harsh with Mr.  Trump because  that's what Roger told her to do.  They were hoping to generate a melt down.  It's too bad he took the bait!<br/><br/>However, no matter how appalling Mr. trump can be he doesn't begin to be as offensive as the theocrats on the stage Thursday night.  They are the source of the war now being waged on women and their personal autonomy.  They are the source of the laws that have virtually criminalized pregnancy.  Did any one hear Huckabee?  Talk about offensive about the rights of women to have control of their own bodies!  <br/><br/>Republicans are anti human.  We need to face it and act accordingly. 

886
Has anyone "followed the money"?<br/>one of the investigative reporters on the times (or wp) should find out if the Clinton machine is financing Trump.<br/>it might be interesting to see who would pay trump to run as a third party candidate.  clinton to finance his run, or the koch bros to pay hime not to.

887
The funniest thing about this article is that "serious" Republicans are concerned that Trump's performance is diverting attention from "substantive" arguments. Give me a break! <br/><br/>The reason there are even two dozen Republican primary candidates in the first place and the reason Trump has a platform is that Republican ideology is entirely devoid of substance. <br/><br/>The Republican playbook consists entirely of one strategic instrument: pretzel logic that will somehow justify, in the minds of the deliberately misinformed, shoveling all of the wealth of the USA into the pockets of already unimaginably rich corporations and multi-billionaires regardless of the environmental, social, and economic costs to the nation or the world.<br/><br/>Republican policies boil down in every instance to "a better deal" or "a better law" or "a better solution" -- never with even a hint of what that better deal, law, or solution is, how it works, or how it will be implemented.<br/><br/>"Substantive debate!" That is even a funnier joke than trump.

If it wasn't a spat with Megyn Kelly, it would've been any other trumped up imaginary conflict to exclude the Donald.  Pun intended.  Who cares?  It just shows how weak and 'politically correct' (PUKE) the 'media' are.  (cough cough two people are wearing your dress! cough cough)

889
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. A majority of Kansans re-elected Brownback and his legislative wrecking crew after seeing the damage they inflicted upon the state's social, educational and fiscal infrastructure. So what are we outsiders to conclude? That loathing for everything government provides  (except federal farm subsidies of course) and the appetite for personal gain trumps any concern for the common weal?<br/>When it comes to civilization, you really do get what you pay for, and apparently Kansans don't want to pay for any. The notion that businesses will want to relocate to a state that has legislated itself down to a corn-fueled version of a banana republic is ludicrous. As their state continues to founder and every state-provided service withers away, Kansans are getting precisely what they deserve - and voted for.

890
Whatever happened to these right wing types always trumpeting the Constitution and the God given right to free speech, open and honest discussion and other false platitudes that apparently only apply to those lower in the latest poll? 

891
I am a woman and i am not offended that Trump called some women fat pigs. Some women are. This is precisely why people like him. For the media to act as if this is something too offensive to say or inherently sexist is precisely the problem and why Trump is popular. If Trump suggested a woman was acting aggressively because she had her period this is boorish but not beyond the pale. It is also a stereotype that stems from lived reality. What offends me is the media telling me what should offend me because I am a woman. I am so sick of being beaten over the head with identity politics. The media is turning things up a notch on trump because they are afraid he is gaining traction. Notice media outlets like the nypost which would like to see a republican win are painting him in an increasingly detestable light. 

892
why do the articles seem to insinuate that trump's vile comments only alienate women? Surely many men are horrified as well, whether for their own integrity, worries about raising daughters in hateful times, concern for their sisters, moms, wives and women friends. 

893
It is incredible that we as a nation might field a candidate as absurd as Donald Trump. His vulgarity and inability to deal with opinions other than his own spell disaster for any foreign policy where diplomacy and tact might be needed to resolve a serious situation or, indeed, to avert a war. On that score alone, the Republican party should do everything in its power to make sure that Trump is trumped. That he has gotten this far is a sign of how low our educational standards have sunk.

894
The fact that Mr. Trump was involved in the debate at all says much about prevailing Republican attitudes towards women.  The fact that the other candidates were outdoing the,selves trumpeting how they planned to punish pregnant women was even more telling.  

895
Rebel without a clue.  That’s what I thought watching trump swing wildly at pitches that weren’t even over the plate.  He can’t be forgiven for the birther nonsense or for his vulgar misogyny, but there’s something about his clueless honesty that exposes the lack of authenticity in the rest of the Republican herd.  In that sense, Trump is the most important candidate in the race.  He says what the current crop of mainstream Republicans actually think.  If you think Bush is a moderate, or Ron Paul is reasonable, or Christie is anything but a self-serving bully, then it’s important to hear Trump channel their actual thoughts.<br/><br/>These cartoon candidates are not unlike Pixar’s Inside Out, in that Anger and Disgust are in charge at Republican Headquarters.  The inflammatory statements and obstructive actions of the more “reasonable” candidates make Trump look moderate by comparison.  At least Trump insults women with mere words rather than by undermining their reproductive rights.  <br/><br/>The best we can hope for is that Trump is rejected by the G.O.P., and decides to run as an independent.  A significant-enough slice of the most zealous low-information voters may split the conservative vote, and give candidates like Hillary or Bernie a better chance.  If that happens, we should erect a larger-than-life statue to the man who saved our democracy, even if the hair costs extra.

896
Why are Democrats and Liberals in general so eager to poo poo trump? As a liberal myself, I would say its refreshing what Mr. Trump is doing to the Republican party: resonating with the ugliest in their base in such a profound and unanimous way, and leading the discourse in the republican party in ways that will make them ultimately unpalatable for 2016. I say, BRING ON THE TRUMP. If you haven't registered yet, vote as a Republican to continue to support this man. All of his brashness and rude comments aside, he brings up a few good points about the oligarchy we have in place and is at the very least a more entertaining person to follow than the "me-toos" who otherwise fill the GOP roll call. 

897
So, these Republicans can spend an entire evening trying to "trump" each other on who's the most contemptuous of women, the female body, reproductive health, and abortion rights, and hardly anyone bats an eye. But when the actual Trump says one characteristically stupid, nasty thing about Megyn Kelly (no great defender of women's reproductive rights herself), everyone hops on board the Fox News bandwagon with a lot of "hand-wringing" about women. Never fear, sisters, this too shall pass and we'll be back to misogyny-as-usual by Monday.

898
Trump was insulting President Obama for years to the enjoyment of the other Republican politicians and candidates and the Fox presenters, including Megyn Kelly, precisely those who now are up in arms because he supposedly offender her.<br/>That shows the double standard both in the GOP and in Fox.<br/>Now they are acting hypocritically, because truth is that Trump is no more offensive that they are.<br/>At least trump is what he is. He does not get paid to insult other people, like the Fox presenters do.

899
for liberals and late-night talk show hosts, The Donald is surely the gift that keeps on giving.  but even they must grow weary at some point.<br/><br/>perhaps it's time for trump's mccarthy moment; all that's needed is a modern-day joseph welch to deliver it..... "let us not degrade these proceedings further. you've done enough. have you no sense of decency, sir? at long last, have you left no sense of decency?"

900
this shows you the real genius of roger ailes, and how cleverly the debate was set up to take trump down a few notches.<br/><br/>but trump's mouth is the gift that keeps on giving.<br/><br/>i'm excited to see his level of support in the coming weeks' polls. they will provide a remarkably clear measurement of the total percentage of really crazy, ignorant people that are living in this country.

901
How about a simple rationale that Israel's demands should always trump US security interests?

902
Her good name has created the climate for the crudity you describe and denounce.  Her trumped up reports of a War On Christmas is a very good example of a base of style she uses that is more akin to junior high school mud fights at recess than an in depth reporter.  Her bias extends from a fundamentalist christian stance that is unfit for anything other than a tent meeting.  And far worse than what she does is what she does not as she never criticized Bill O'Reilly when he threatened a son of a victim of 9/11 so why should I feel bad for her when Donald Trump threatens her with the same schoolyard bullying?  It makes no sense to sympathize with someone who has embraced and broadcast this kind of low rent Fox News hair-pulling.  She's reaping just what she sowed.  

903
It's clear that the Republicans are trying to jettison Trump as fast as they can. Erick Erickson himself has a long history of denigrating women with whom he disagrees: <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/8/9120783/erick-erickson-donald-trump-sexism" title="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/8/9120783/erick-erickson-donald-trump-sexism" target="_blank">http://www.vox.com/2015/8/8/9120783/erick-erickson-donald-trump-sexism</a> , Strange that he's now all sensitive about the ladies' feelings.

904
My distaste of trump is not because he's arrogant, outspoken, and doesn't follow the party line.  My distaste for him is because he's a narcissistic megalomaniac who seems only interested in self aggrandizement and getting his way.  Those are traits better suited to a Roman emperor or dictator...not the president of a democracy.

905
The NYTimes didn't presume the meaning of Trump's remarks. Jeb Bush did. Carly Fiorina did. Lindsey Graham did. And most importantly, Erick Erickson, did. And that's why they trumped Trump. <br/><br/>Actually glad Trump's in the race. He exposes the soft underbelly and limited ideas of the Republican Party well enough that even Fox News aficinados cry, "'nuf with 'da nuts!"

906
I do not have much time for kelly. She is part of the shrill screech of false indignation and deliberate ignorance that permeates fox. She can be caught multiple times daily saying things that are patently absurd, too obviously false to be "mistakes." However, what trump said was just a grotesque misogynist slur. She may not have much to offer as a journalist, but it not because she is a woman, or because she menstruates. That said, it is EXACTLY that kind of foul, grotesque, outrageously disgraceful bigotry that appeals to the Republican party base, which is why trump is leading his closest opponent by double. Fox and the republican party created the "Donster" they now face

907
I am not a Republican and the chances I would ever join, endorse, or vote Republican are 0. Trump says what is on his mind, he has no filters, and his followers love it. He can get away with it, even his followers know they cannot say what he says in their own jobs for fear of conflict with federal and private codes of conduct. <br/><br/>I get that, I understand. Polished candidates are boring, they follow guidelines and answer to the 1% status quo, Donald on the other hand is  like the 1970's Clint Eastwood character Harry Callahan,  the new millineums "Dirty Harry". <br/><br/>The seething politically incorrect guy is how Mr. trump fancies himself and he has is probably just as surprised as many of us that his numbers are as large as they are right now.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the classic example of "self will run riot" and I for one am captivated by seeing how it turns out. 

908
why is it in politics since the 60's when people speak the truth about what americans are truly thinking about your called a disrupter?  i watched that debate and you could tell right away the fair and balanced was non existent. they went after trump with national enquirer garbage and did not ask one question pertaining to if he got in the white house, while the rest got the normal puff ball q's and the normal meaningless responses. it almost seems like ailes is sewed to the behind of the bush's and he got really puff ball q's! it makes you wonder about fox and their blurb of fair and balanced. the vast majority of blogs are saying the same thing. while i don't plan on voting for trump i am going for the hp ceo she is a true leader and has a back bone she would beat the walking old lady in pant suits as a leader and president. if we must have a woman lets put a leader in we have had 6+ years of helmless country!

909
Meqyn got what she deserved....now the corrupt media and corrupt democrats are thinking they have trump, but they don't.<br/><br/>America needs Donald now more than ever, as Marxism has infected education, government and the courts...DONALD IS OUR LAST HOPE!!!

910
Excellent article.  BTW - as Trump has pointed out in many of his speaking events, the media often takes bits of what someone says and takes it out of context to form a false narrative; this controversy with Trump's comments about blood coming out of Megyn Kelly's eyes, and her "whatever", is no exception to this politically correct crowd who conveniently left out that Trump had also commented that Chris Wallace had blood coming out of his eyes too later in that same interview with Don Lemon.  For some in the media to conclude that Trump was insinuating that Megyn kelly was "hormonal" and that just crosses the line is laughable. <br/><br/>In 2006, O'Donnell referred to Trump as a "snake-oil salesman" for deciding not to fire Miss USA Tara Connor. As a response, Trump referred to O'Donnell as "nice fat little Rosie" and a "dummy."  <br/><br/>Well, no one can disagree that Rosie is fat, and well maybe even a dummy in Trumps opinion, but it's just not politicallhy corrrect to say the "fat" word, right?  Funny, though, most people probably agree with Trump, but just wouldn't say it.   Well, if you're going to insult Mr. Trump, don't cry like a baby when he insults you back, whether you are a man or a woman.  <br/><br/>BTW - trump has plenty harsh things to say against his male critics too!!!

911
I find trump to be a buffoon, and then I read the lock step leftist dribble comments about faux news and the GOP's fake war on women (a war the islamics are actually pursuing that goes ignored and dismissed by the leftist apologists) or how donny is just right wing ducks clucking back to the roost (or some tired mindless cliches) and find the commenters herein, Hillbilly and the Grubers united, to be equally ridiculous.   

912
@Brian108 : It's been obvious for decades that Trump is a deeply insecure person, who must constantly justify his miserable existence by trumpeting that he and everything he touches is the greatest, the richest, the best, ad nauseum. In fact, Trump is a miserable excuse for a human being, it is appropriate that he was brought down by a woman like Megyn  Kelly — although, to be fair, she had a minor role: Trump brought himself down. "Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall."  

913
trump will demolish the corporate media and their puppet candidate to win the Gop nomination...the only person that can keep him from the white house is bernie...and if either one gets into the white house, the stream of cheap foreign labor will be ended...

914
Trump is definitely a plant (slightly potted!) to sabotage the Republicans. <br/><br/>The sooner they realize it the better off they'll be.<br/>Does anyone really believe he could be that borish, that disgusting without putting on an act?<br/><br/>Come on, get real.<br/>He's an actor at best, a mole more likely. <br/><br/>Here's the real Trump.<br/>As liberal as they come.<br/>Read and weep conservatives.<br/>You're being hoodwinked. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS" title="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?...</a>

Rich, <br/><br/>Come on now...<br/><br/>Mike Huckabee: "The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is to kill people break things."<br/><br/>Rand Paul: "I don't want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington."<br/><br/>Kasich was decent enough, but old-style moderate candidates like him or Jon Huntsman no longer have a place in the GOP.<br/><br/>More goodies here: <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-aide-dismisses-blood-critics-says-hes-bulletproof-n406596" title="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-aide-dismisses-blood-critics-says-hes-bulletproof-n406596" target="_blank">http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-aide-dismisses-blood...</a>

916
It's become the issue of the moment to take down Trump. An obsession. And an almost disregard bordering on fear to allow people to hear and decide for themselves. "Intellectuals" in the press will decide for them. I'm sensing that the biggest opponent of Trump is now squarely the collective Republican Party which may be just what a candidate needs to get Independents and conservative Democrats on board, with other Republicans having no other alternative but to sheepishly get behind the gravy train. It's a familiar formula, the left really taking the minority vote for granted and getting it and paying closer attention to garnering either voter apathy or support from the middling of both parties. A pseudo-ticket-divide like President Clinton enjoyed in round one.<br/><br/>So in lining up with the pack of dogs to get their chance to tear at the Trump meat in an era of who-can-predict-what-people-want politics a la President Obama's coming in from left field checkmate of Hilary, it's a long way from over and best to pay attention to the chords Trump struck that put him here in the first place rather than to angle on and trump up his loose cannon ways, which may be already factored into his position anyway.  Steal his thunder, rather than rain on his parade. 

917
trumpWow, Larry, you're an odd one.  So glad Trump says what intelligent Americans are thinking.  Can't wait until Hillary gets pilloried by Sanders, O'Malley, and perhaps Biden.  That will make the Republican circus look like a side show for the smart.

918
At first, the idea of Donald Trump as president intrigued me. As an outsider with executive savvy, he would not doubt surround himself with the best and the brightest, being a non-politician was a positive.  So I looked forward to seeing him transform himself into a statesman.<br/><br/>Then I saw The Debate. If I had any questions regarding Mr. trumps loyalty and integrity, it was answered from the first question. When he refused to take the oath and stood there with his arms separated, shoulders hunched and a "whatcha gonna do?" expression on his face, he lost me.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire debate, everything he said was something he repeated from previous statements.  Always generic. Never specific. In short, I learned nothing more about his platform.  <br/><br/>He came off as a boorish bully that resorted to cheap shots getting very personal and vicious. He mocked Sen. Paul's hearing aid.  I bet he mocked kids with polio when he was a child.  He's in no position to mock another's personal looks when he wears his hair in that ridiculous "I'm-not-going-bald" comb-over.

919
This sounds great, but the harsh truth is that a mediocre record at Columbia will trump a distinguished record in the honors program at UT-Chattanooga nearly every time.<br/><br/>During my time at a large NYC law firm, I wound up on the recruiting committee and I pushed for educational and ethnic diversity more than most and some of the best hires we had were from off the usual track. Still...<br/><br/>The problem was time. We got a slew of resumes and had work to do beside what we did on management committees. I couldn't interview everyone I thought deserved an interview. So we took shortcuts on choices that wouldn't be faulted even of they didn't work out. I don't doubt that there are people getting great educations in these honors programs, but all too often, one's degree pedigree is a shortcut for hiring decisions made under constraints of time and resources. <br/><br/>At the apex where I was, the places where getting in is generally success for life, there are institutional issues and barriers that are biased toward the Ivies, the elite privates like Stanford and MIT and the stellar public universities like Berkeley and Michigan.<br/><br/>The system stinks, but it is what it is. Mr. Fisher is an outlier; a Rhodes scholarship would probably get him in the door. 

920
So, I'm a deep dyed democrat who watched the debate just as I might watch the practice of a rival athletic team. Not time to be content, but I have hope. The pet trump (trump pet?) doesn't offend me that much. I didn't watch the second team play, but with the limited exception for Kasich, the prime-time team came off as pompous, supercilious little boys with a desire to control everyone else and, even worse, are jingoist, saber rattling mad dogs of war. I have personal misgivings about our front runner. But, she is so determined to leave a legacy of things that most Democrats agree about, that I will be glad to see her win and keep alive what President Obama has started. 

921
This POS actually polling high and potentially being the Republican nominee is good for our democracy because it will force lazy people to get out and vote - which everyone seemed to stop doing:<br/><a href="http://mankabros.com/blogs/those_damn_kids/2015/06/17/america-needs-donald-trump-to-become-president/" title="http://mankabros.com/blogs/those_damn_kids/2015/06/17/america-needs-donald-trump-to-become-president/" target="_blank">http://mankabros.com/blogs/those_damn_kids/2015/06/17/america-needs-dona...</a>

922
lets start with 'I don't like trump"<br/>however the moderators from the small cable network that runs the GOP and decides who  gets to run went after trump.  He's not your standard pol so he went after them.<br/>I hope what they are doing with trying to side line him is force him to run on his own. Thank you FOX and your little cadre of drones.<br/>PS  M. Kelly is one of the biggest liars on the network of liars.  

923
I salute you, Mr. Layton.  Unfortunately, many rich, including Trump and Hollywood "stars",  flaunt marriage and raise dysfunctional families  -  that media trumpets as success.  We are becoming an increasingly warped society that worships only money, not real values and harmony.

924
I'm sad to see there's only two people, both women, who realize the main stream media is getting punked by roger ailes and "fair and balanced" and thats you and cokie roberts.<br/><br/>the rest of the nattering nabobs of the nattering chattering class so hate trumnp and everything he stands for that they took a typical dumb trump comment about blood (I heard it my self and at no time did I think he was referring to her period) and manufactured a reason for them to boot him from the debates. it was a setup. and the chatterers got punked. again.<br/><br/>this line of questioning from fox news version of fay raye allows them to a) present a faux defense of women, the repubs most obvious shortcoming if the dems nominate THAT WOMAN and b) get trupm out of it ASAP. b/c we all kow if he stays another 6 mos and dosent implode he WILL run 3rd party and then its all over but the crying.....<br/><br/>at least then for the first time in my life, I wont have to hold my nose and go home for shower after being  forced to vote for THAT WOMAN in our 4 yr spectacle of choosing bad over worse. you go mo....

925
Whats sad is that the Donald admits to taking part in crony-capitalist politics, yet the Retrumplicans actually think he's not for sale.

926
Well said sir. Amen. I l live about two blocks from a building bearing his name, never gave it much thought except in occasionally noticing the mildly annoying crassness, the trumpeting of Trump. But not after that last crack of his, now I am a believer. Keep it real Mr. Donald. Wherever...   Yup!  Keep it real.

927
Of all the Republican and Democratic candidates, only one person who really stands out as a good commander-in-chief;  that's James Webb.<br/><br/>He's far from perfect, but he's a good, honest, intelligent person with lots of guts who knows how Washington works and exactly what the threats to our nation are and how to deal with them.<br/><br/>He's received many honors and awards, but here's part of the citation for his<br/>Navy Cross:<br/><br/>"Observing the grenade land dangerously to his companion, First Lt Webb simultaneously fired his weapon at the enemy, pushed the Marine away from<br/>the grenade, and shielded him from the explosion with his own body."<br/><br/>Mr Webb has got the Right Stuff.  The G.O.P. debate may have been entertaining, but it was sad to see so many candidates overshadowed by<br/>the bombastic buffoon trump.<br/><br/>On the Democratic side the obviously corrupt, mendacious Hillary leads the pack.<br/><br/>Hence I hope very much that gentle readers will give Jim Webb a good look.

928
True alpha males are leaders who do not demean others. trump is a petulant, ego-maniacal, immature child

929
 Folks, it's so obvious that trump was set-up in the debate to look bad<br/><br/>1. the FAUX moderators had WEEKS to plan their questions<br/>2. so they START with a question that they KNOW only trump will say 'yes' to...<br/>3. and thereby, with 5,000 people in the audience, 90% of whom are supporting<br/>OTHER candidates ... the FAUX moderators expected and setup trump to be<br/>embarrassed and boooooooooooooooooed ...<br/><br/>you call that 'journalism'?<br/><br/>i UN-tivo'd megyn kelly and chris wallace shows 

930
Trump even has the right name for what he does. He trumps all the pc politicians and columnists not because he is obnoxious but because he dares to be real.

931
Is it possible trump has more sinister motives?  Is it to make it abundantly clear what the Republican party is all about?  Is there any doubt after watching that debate what you're getting when voting for any one of these candidates?  Whether it is or isn't, there is no doubt they're all similarly as boorish and offensive as Trump.  If that was his goal, well he's been abundantly successful.

932
trump brings an air force academy quote to mind:  "all mach, no heading."

933
"that trump guy, what a card."<br/><br/>that's the media treatment he deserves and requires:  no more and no less than bugs bunny gave elmer fudd or daffy duck in the old (good) 1950s cartoons.<br/><br/>trump is a cartoon character at heart, not a serious candidate, and hardly a human being based on the froth and bluster of his "campaign."<br/><br/>what's up donald...we... doc?

934
it's brain slugs eating at whatever was in that otherwise hollow cavity...remember?  from futurerama?  trump is the quintessential cartoon buffoon.<br/><br/>give him an elmer fudd hat to wear over the bad combover and put him out to pasture to hunt wabbits.

935
I, too, am the black-sheep liberal in my extended family. Their conservative politics is everything you've noted plus a certainty that the United States is a Christian nation and the Bible trumps our Constitution. Their certainty of that is unshakable.  They are very nice people who believe liberals, atheists, and highly educated scientists/experts are all motivated by hubris and a hatred of God, thus anything we say is merely part of our plot to rid our country of Christians. 

936
Trump continues to trump.  

937
Hi Dave.. Pretty sure it's your team that made up this excuse to sideline trump. Our team are big trump fans! <br/><br/>But just for clarity, you're totally cool with the Donald's remarks about women who have the nerve to call him out , like calling them fat pigs and animals, right?<br/><br/>Good luck with that.

"Rivals Jab at Donald Trump as Republican Debate Becomes Testy" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/us/politics/rivals-jab-at-donald-trump-as-gop-debate-becomes-testy.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/us/politics/rivals-jab-at-donald-trump-as-gop-debate-becomes-testy.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/us/politics/rivals-jab-at-donald-trump...</a><br/><br/>24 Million people tuned into Fox's first Republican Debate Thursday night. Composed of the nation's top republican candidates, 10 men took center stage at Quicken Loans in Cleveland. For two hours, participants discussed a variety of topics provided by a panel of three moderators. Center stage stood Donald Trump. Followed by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker on either side. Although the debate in itself means nothing in terms of who will become the republican nominee, the debate did serve useful in terms of acquainting the audience with the contenders. Some, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, showed control and repeat for his party members. Others, such as Donald Trump, showed utter disrespect towards his colleagues. Despite shared a common enemy in Hilary Clinton and other Democrats, it is clear that support from within the Republican Party is hard to find. At one point, Donald Trump even refused to support the Republican nominee unless it is him. As described in the article, "Mr. Trump displayed his trademark pugnacity from the start with the bravura moment...facing loud boos from the audience members ..as several other Republicans looked flabbergasted" (Patrick Healy 1). It will certainly be interesting to see how strategies change for the next debate in September.

939
Mr. Trump is blasting his trumpet, and let us hope we do not have on our hands, a modern day self-proclaimed god called Caligula. 

940
The people actually WANT more of this Trump behavior. We are sick and tired of PC and what better to oppose of then with a full frontal assault exposing the use of PC by the press to manipulate election? That is what this is about - not being rude or mysogynistic. Wake up! The people know that insanity is to keep supporting the same "mold" of Republican while expecting different results. We elected supposed conservatives to Congress and look what it got us- nothing. Conservatives know we have nothing to lose by backing trump becaus we see through the charade of RINOs in office today. IF Trump loses, at least we will have sent the RINOs a message- don't take our votes for granted anymore!

941
the fox-con inside job rig was obvious at the pledge request.if trump joins he looks weak.coverage on msnbc shows them to be on the other side of the same bed

942
Yes, I think Hillary Clinton will get grilled that way.  I don't understand why Republican-leaning voters think that the lame-stream media go easy on Democratic candidates.  Those who wonder about that must spend all their time watching CNN, NBC, CBS and ABC instead of reading NYT or WP, where there is plenty of grilling of Dems.  Anyone who considers the trumpery of Fox News to be media-professional activity needs to give a listen to "On the Media," which is an equal-opportunity grilling roast.

943
The purpose of this debate was to take out Trump. Everyone on that stage has been demeaning to women but they went after Trump, why? He won't kiss the ring and wash the feet of fox, Koch and Adelson. Therefore he has to be taken out. They selected Kelly to do it because she's an attractive young woman who follows orders well. And then the trump card was Erickson disinviting trump to his event. Erickson who tolerates any language as long as the candidate kisses his feet. <br/><br/>They have no problem with Ted Cruz  accusing  President Obama of “funding radical Islamic terrorism". That is equivalent to calling the president a traitor to his country, a term that fits Cruz much better for signing the letter to the Iranian mullahs. <br/><br/>They want Trump out of the race and will do whatever they have to to get him out.

This Fox entertainment show, the GOP "debate"/beauty pageant/mud-wrestling event continues to be hilarious. Both the program itself and its post-event predictable media mashup highlight the final convergence of "news" and marketing.<br/>Fox, home of the Simpsons and Roger Ailes personal political channel, scored big in the ratings. Goal #1 achieved. Goal #2? Trump was put to "tough" questions to demonstrate how the three hosts were journalists, not Murdoch Minions and to help the GOP owners in their attempt to diminish or destroy the Trumpenstein the Party itself has created. Goal at least partially achieved, thanks to the predictable post-event Trump attack on poor, defenseless Megyn Kelly. Fox should be able to milk that for months, particularly as long as Trump keeps trumpeting.<br/><br/>So the wrestling match continues, with its sports commentary, including that in the NYTimes musing about who's up or down, who won or gained ground. <br/><br/>Funny how little is mentioned or delved into about the extreme statements of Walker on abortion, or the non-reaction to Trump's honest description of political bribery. No corporate media questioning of why climate change, economic injustice, student debt, our rotting infrastructure were topics that didn't make the "tough" questions teed up by the faux journalists. <br/><br/>The Daily Show reporters would be doing a better job. So Fox and the GOP have lucked on that too.

Class, as Kevin Rothstein and Kristof show, trumps (oops) inherent value, effort, and learning in America.<br/>W. Bush certainly showed that.<br/>And so does Jeb, "the smart one".<br/>And Donald Trump, "the honest one".<br/>And Romney, ""the job-maker".<br/>Forget bootstrapping, finding success is picking your parents<br/>carefully. That's "the class system".<br/>Like "In God We Trust", "equal opportunity" is just a slogan, an ad, a con on a coin.

Erick Erickson has his own problematic remarks about women. Seems like the pot is calling the kettle black. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexist-jerk-erick-erickson-slams-donald-trump-for-being-sexist_55c68260e4b0923c12bd1647" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexist-jerk-erick-erickson-slams-donald-trump-for-being-sexist_55c68260e4b0923c12bd1647" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexist-jerk-erick-erickson-slams-don...</a>

Rubbish. You are not a capitalist "through and through" if you think the government should trump shareholders in setting or limiting pay.

948
Roger Ailes and Fox News, after six years of treating President Obama like a field hand, now are trying to distance themselves from the GOP avatar they created. After all the lashings and abuse they stooped to inflict on the president, after all their promoting of every wingnut their cameras could find, they suddenly take great but feigned umbrage when their creation swipes his fangs across one of “their own.” It’s time to sign a civil commitment order against the GOP and its trumpet, Fox News.

949
trump says what he thinks and he doesn't think.<br/><br/>forthright and witless...not a good combination....

950
megyn kelly + duggar family x donald trump = tim russert?!!

951
What is more disheartening was Trump or the audience the future voters ?<br/><br/>When trump made a disparaging remark on Rosie O'Donnell the could not contain their glee  of breaking out into cheers and hand clapping.  <br/><br/>It that what America has become ?<br/>Trump is a Presidential contender and Rosie O'Donnell is an entertainer. 

952
Oh, poor Donald.  He was "disinvited" from a prestigious gathering of GOP luminaries, and now we're seeing stories about how he's gone too far, the base is turning against him, blah blah blah:<br/><br/><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/trumps-remarks-make-the-gop-angry.html" title="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/trumps-remarks-make-the-gop-angry.html" target="_blank">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/trumps-remarks-make-the-gop...</a><br/><br/>Until I see some actual numbers that show that the Jim Bobs in the Republican base are abandoning Trump, I wouldn't count him out.  All Trump is doing is acting as an echo chamber for what the right-wing "base" that is the Republican party actually thinks and believes, but does not have the national stage to say.

953
What is the relevant journalism standard for a Page 1 lead article sub-headline.  Basis in fact, or solid conclusion based upon fact, and not opinion?   “Suggestion That Moderator Was Menstruating” is the key speculation on his inner thought that prompted his “blood from wherever” retort.  <br/><br/>Reader comments discuss this phrase as general allusion to “seeing blood” type metaphors, or whatever.   The women’s menstrual narrative may be trumped up here for purpose – I cannot know for sure, unless Trump says it, as an admission.  To make this a headline phrase is poor journalism – from my favorite news source no less – ouch!

954
Who is calling the kettle black? Erickson has been quoted in Huff Post lately with the most disgusting remarks about women. He should know all about disrespect for women! I am laughing at the hypocrisy of all those men on stage. Proud of defunding health care for women. Proud that fetuses trump a woman's life. Proud to bow down to the Pope on birth control. Proud to refuse to make men lazy about their using birth control instead. Proud to let people drop anchor babies in our economy in its already poor shape. Proud to say the government needs to bring in the FBI and the National Guard on anyone associated with ending a pregnancy. Pride, Puritanism, and Hypocrisy will kill the Republican party. The Republican Party is killing itself like out-of-control cancer cells do the human body.

955
Donald Trump is the elephant in the GOP room.  And John Kasich identified Trump as one at the species level when he said that Trump has struck a chord.  <br/><br/>It's too bad that Kasich didn't take it to a subspecies level naming the Trump-eting Elephant and his followers for what they are.  The subspecies are very angry at the incompetence of the rest of their species -- the fact that the GOP is filled to the brim and dominated by what The Donald trumpets as "stupid" and "weak" politicians (of which, of course, he himself is revealing himself to be an even more extreme example....)

956
if you think your boss from work would make a good president, vote for trump.<br/><br/>at least we'll get universal haircare.

957
trumps a chump who has the goods on many of those canidates on stage, but shame on the press for promoting his vulgar acting skills.

958
I watched the debate because I knew it would be good comedy.  Nothing like it on the sitcoms.  It was not solely because of Trump.  Let's see there's Cruz.  He's always good for a laugh.  Surprised he didn't read to his children.  And then there's Huckabee and Carson who is not even qualified (much like trump).  And the representatives of Fox news were also entertaining.  No meaningful questions were asked.  I mean give me a break,  Does God talk to the candidates? It didn't disappoint me.  Like I said, it's fun to watch the Republicans self destruct, like they have tried to destruct our great country.  I sincerely hope they find a decent candidate.

959
The people know that insanity is to keep supporting the same "mold" of Republican while expecting different results. We elected supposed conservatives to Congress and look what it got us- nothing. Conservatives know we have nothing to lose by backing trump becaus we see through the charade of RINOs in office today. IF Trump loses, at least we will have sent the RINOs a message- don't take our votes for granted anymore!

960
It seems that Mr. Trump nowhere said that Megan Kelly was having her menses and that this was an interpretation others gave to his remarks and then, in a spasm of political correctness, disinvited him from a convention of Republican donors, thus proving his point about political correctness dominating our political discussions. Trump trumped them.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Megan Kelly was picked to field this question to Trump and she did seem to have blood coming out of her eyes and her mouth when she asked it. She relished baiting him. The question could have been asked by one of the male moderators, but Fox was playing a blood sport with Trump.<br/><br/>Trump is more a jester whose shenanigans highlight the failings of the other contenders and our esteemed politicians than a businessman politician. He is right when he says that political correctness is intimidating our national discourse and is antithetical to free speech, but he lapses too often into degrading speech which only hurts his cause, if he really has one. Moderation is not in the cards for Mr. Trump.

961
So, we spend an evening listening to Republicans out 'trump' each other with expressions of contempt for women, the female body, reproductive health, and abortion rights and don't bat an eye. But once the actual Trump makes one of his characteristically stupid and nasty comments about women, applied to Megyn Kelly (no great defender of reproductive health herself), everyone hops on the hand-wringing bandwagon with Fox News.  I suspect that this newly found concern for "women" will be short-lived and we'll be back to Republican misogyny-as-usual by tomorrow.   

962
rnc convention with the don reminds of henry the 8 and his 14 wives<br/><br/>this is a miss america pageant on trumps terms <br/><br/>the only good is henrys wives might attack each other and<br/>the only blood that will be seen is theirs<br/><br/>while megyn and hillary can use silence as their modus operandi<br/>and win miss america without even trying

"If you love the law, and you love good sausage, you don't want to see how either is made", a quote attributed to many people. <br/><br/>You could insert 'politics' in place of 'the law' and the line would still be appropriate, no matter who first said it.<br/><br/>Trump would not be my choice for POTUS, but he is shining light on how 'politics is made'.  His sharp brain and tongue attacks both sides as well as the middle.  <br/><br/>His comments about Megan Kelly 'bleeding from....whatever' are crude and rude.  <br/><br/>His comments about Lindsey Graham (R-SC) calling him for money (with Graham's cell phone number offered as proof) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) being "told to attend my wedding and she did" (with pics of Hillary and Bill at Trump's wedding offered for proof) show that money trumps most anything in politics (pun intended). <br/><br/>Trump's statements about Megan Kelly and Rosie O'Donnell are not important to me.  Ms. Kelly can handle herself well and doesn't need help by anyone, and Rosie O'Donnell can handle herself well and can use the publicity.  <br/><br/>Trump's statements aren't nearly as bad as statements by men and women during the Clinton years when he was accused of having affair after affair and proven to have had an affair with a young woman only 6.5 years older than his daughter.  The frequent use of the term, "bimbo", combined with James Carville's "If you drag a $100 bill through a trailer park there's no telling what you will find", is as crude and rude as one can get.

What does the selfie stick tell us? That sometimes your phone's camera will get a nice wide-angle shot of you and the group of friends you're with when it's on the end of a stick. Not everyone has go-go-gadget extend-o arms. That's why I prefer one of the original names for the device that never caught on - a monopod. It's a shame that the narcissists' usage of the sticks have trumped everyone's conception of monopods - including those that might want to give one a try without fear of being judged as completely vain.

967
if these spineless republican leaders and the runners do not back off trump by nov 2015 the over 20% who support him wil not vote any candidate and that includes daddy's little boy jeb. what ailes did at that debate shamed him and the network. fair and balanced was nonexistent. ailes if you are bush licker take a break till after nov 2016 as for the other clowns running your gonna lose you keep it up!  i think you know what i mean! over 20% of your party is quite a voting bloc to loose!

Rupert Murdoch, who is not even American, is laughing all the way to the bank. He and trump are Laughing at the stupid American right wing who have bought in to their trolling experiment

my dear Vermonter: not any deterrent when a country is run by a religious clergy class who believe in and teach their Job One is the destruction of this corrupt world, thus bringing in their Messiah to resurrect the Righteous among the dead. Americans are not counted among the Righteous. Actually, a few of them are held up in a prison in Iran, on some trumped up espionage charges.  Basing our survival on hope and goodwill of the mad is not our American Constitutional right :-(

Megan kelly needs to get in another line of work,,suggesting out of the public eye,,I am not thrilled with Mr.trump but give this he has guts..now here a thought he could and should buy Fox news,,fire everyone,,all they do is or know to do is bash,,embarrass anyone they think will help thier ratings,,,hey you all at Fox,,give it up,,all it makes is make you look stupid..<br/>Shall we shout hallelujah..

I doubt trump will win, but then Jesse Ventura won so who knows. Fox set u\out to do what the party leadership wanted them to do, attack Trump, elevate their other candidates and maybe weed some of them out. Problem is that backfired, all it did was elevate Trump, Bush looked pathetic, and if you watched both debates, carly fiorna came out looking the best (followed close by Ben Carson). The GOP trying to discredit Trump saying the now need a serious debate, but still allow the likes of Graham, Santorum, Huckabee, Pataki.  That being said at least  the GOP is having debates, The Dems cant hold a debate, because they don't want their chosen one, the one they have sunk time, energy and money into, to be exposed more than she is (currently the press does a good job covering for her, in a debate they risk making her vulnerable). So while the GOP is flawed in many of its candidates, and will severely damage itself if they stick behind JEb, at least they are out there debating

972
"...the racial gap in electoral participation has by now disappeared"<br/><br/>****<br/>Unfortunately, people believe that claiming "racism" automatically trumps empirical evidence.  <br/><br/>Democrats' efforts would be better spent, and Americans would be better served, if democrats directed their efforts to getting All eligible voters to vote.  Turn out is abysmal.

973
Common Sense!<br/>Anyone who has spent an hour exercising while watching the calories used meter knows the frustration of how long and hard it is to burn meaningful amounts of calories.  And then how quickly just one sugary treat undoes all the hard work. Further, exercise tends to increase the sensation of hunger. No one knows the truth of this situation more than Coke, Inc.<br/>MONEY trumps morality once again!

974
Michael-"Shoddy public education with biased teaching at the behest of the local board of education is why Americans are so uninformed and make wrong choices in the voting booth".<br/>Sure let's blame everything on liberal agenda of the public education system. It is a known fact that most of the wealthy vote republican. You can't FORCE a person to be informed! You can't FORCE a person to acknowledge factual data over mythical beliefs. You can't FORCE a person to be better educated, to read to broaden his horizons. The failure doesn't lie with the educational system it lies with us. Our ideology trumps scientific data. Our ideology trumps logic. Our ideology trumps truth. If fact runs counter to the ideology the true believer discards the facts. No amount of education will ever change this ingrained belief system. I know what I know and no amount of facts or data will change my mind. How do we fix this mindset?

975
This is MRS.  Former Senator Joseph McCarthy is responsible for the anti-communist hysteria of the time and his estate should be responsible to restore to the heirs of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg what was taken by executing the Rosenbergs.  That the Rosenberg sons (nka Meeropol) had to file for the documents that proved other than the hysterical story the public was told for many decades is sinful unto itself.  This was political trumpeting at is lowest.  The US government again doing nothing to protect its own citizens.

As the father of Black daughters I beg to differ on your thesis. The quickest lesson they learned, in their single sex school, is that race and class will always trump gender.

Unfortunately the Grievance Industry has learned it can make money off of increased outrage. So even those cases that were absolutely justified are being pumped up to national outrage status in order to fill someone's pockets. I have long questioned how the 'unemployed grad student' Deray McKesson can afford to fly to all these locations in order to organize "official" protests. I wonder if he has declared any of these gifts on his FAFSA or with the IRS. I am not discounting that some cops are bullies. My own son, because he drove the worlds slowest little red car, was followed from school to work for months and got two very petty tickets based on his gender and age-he's white. My other son, during a period when he was unemployed and had to drive a beater, got several tickets for no inspection, no tags, etc. It happens. That the minority groups have trumped this kind of incident to harassment is ridiculous. The most recent event in our area featured a 19 yr old who had just finished deferred adjudication for oxycodone possession. He broke a lock on a gate to a car lot, drove through the window into a dealership, jumped on and vandalized cars all at two in the morning. When police were called b/c of the burglary alarms, they had no idea if the perp was armed or not. The perp resisted, started fighting, got shot and died. Yet all the usual groups will gather to protest. Help me understand why.

978
Unfortunately, convenience will usually win out over security.  The ability to remotely turn on your air conditioner before you come home will trump the thought that such convenience would allow others access to your home.  The person who invents the equivalent of a door lock for home and car systems will make a fortune.  A digital lock that would secure access to the home and car electronic systems except for the person who holds the "key."  It would have to be robust, easy for an amateur to use, and of course, not have a back door.<br/><br/>Another reason for having such a key is that it won't take long for car and insurance companies long to figure out that they could save big money on claims if they can download data from a car or home about the claim.  "You were speeding before the accident, claim denied."

979
Of course God trumps the economy, because if we actually elect one these people President then we all better start praying.

"Most Times revenue, about 70 percent, still comes from print."<br/><br/>Yeah. Exactly. So what was all that nonsense several years back that the Times was now making as much digitally as from print? Was trumpeted several times.

However, Dr. K., the fresh-water crowd shutting themselves off from outside ideas and delving into RBC provided the next smoke-screen the rightists needed, since in 1981, barely a year after St. Ray-gun's election, budget director David Stockman stood up in front of the world and freely admitted that indeed Ray-gun's budget numbers were hokum and ' voodoo ':<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/13/us/stockman-offers-reagan-regrets-and-keeps-his-job.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/13/us/stockman-offers-reagan-regrets-and-keeps-his-job.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/13/us/stockman-offers-reagan-regrets-and-...</a><br/><br/>as correctly labeled by Bush 41 in the 1980 GOP'er primaries.<br/><br/>Of course, there are those who say Stockman wasn't really in trouble, since he had been ' useful ':<br/><br/><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/04/the_stockman_woodshed_myth.html" title="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/04/the_stockman_woodshed_myth.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/04/the_st...</a><br/><br/>The fresh-water crowd was mainly interested in trashing Keynesianism by whatever method could be manufactured, and with Stockman's admission of utter fakery, the fresh-water guys needed a new smoke-screen.<br/><br/>It is the same today, as we see GOP'ers not addressing any of their policy mistakes that led to the utter debacle in 2008; they campaign on nothing more than " It's our turn again ", while voters know that what matters to them is ' purity ' - no matter what worked in the Clinton years and Obama years.<br/><br/>The purity of their belief as to the way things should be trumps all, making them mos' dangerous indeed.

Why are there no Democrats shouting this for the rooftops?  Where is the host of Democratic politicos taking claim for this good news?  Even Hilary Clinton seems to be running away from Obama.  the left needs to be trumpeting their successes.

As a fan of Asimov and psychohistory, I think you might appreciate my friend's take on the Donald:<br/><br/>"In Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy (which is all The Omnivore recognizes) the titular group--The Foundation--is created by a man who has pioneered a science of predicting the future by studying the psychology of mass-groups of people. In the second book, after his predicted fall of the empire, the new order, led by The Foundation, is threatened by something he did not see coming: a mutant known as The Mule who could alter men's minds through actual (and never-before discovered--as far as the reader knows) telepathy.<br/><br/>This one individual broke humanity's genius plan--altering it irreparably--because of his singular talent.<br/><br/>Exactly how this applies to today's GOP Primary is left up to the reader."<br/><br/>(<a href="http://politicalomnivore.blogspot.com/2015/08/trump-bomb-damage-assessment.html)" title="http://politicalomnivore.blogspot.com/2015/08/trump-bomb-damage-assessment.html)" target="_blank">http://politicalomnivore.blogspot.com/2015/08/trump-bomb-damage-assessme...</a>

Interesting (but perhaps not surprising) to see the tone of these comments.  Since when does freedom of the press trump the national security interests of the country?  In World War II, correspondents were credentialed, in uniform and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice or its predecessor.  There was an understanding that they had been extended a privilege (not a right) to operate in the battle zone, and that their work would be subjected to censorship in order to protect the operational security of the forces with which they operated...and themselves.<br/>In Viet Nam, the gloves were off and the "ruthlessly adversarial" environment referred to by one commenter evolved. to the detriment of both the forces and the press.  The embedded concept of recent wars was probably an attempt to return to the mutually supportive relationship of WW II, but in these days when any blogger with a keyboard can claim to be a reporter, there is little control over what is published.  There is good reason for the classification of some information in a combat zone, but many of today's generation of reporters seem to have little awareness of those dangers.  These guidelines are an attempt to establish publicly recognized rules for safe operations of both the reporters and the troops.  A few tweaks may be appropriate, but I applaud DoD's effort to impose some sense into the process.  

988
Donald Trump's forbears immigrated  to the US from Scotland in the late 19th century.  At the time, there were many penurious immigrants from Scotland and Ireland.  At the time, there was widespread discrimination against the immigrants; the feeling was that these people were undesirable.  Though there is not much on the web regarding the reasons for the immigration of Trump's ancestors, it should be assumed that they did not come with many resources.  Trump would be proud to trumpet the success that he and his family have achieved.  In view of the fact that his family is not of Mayflower parentage, It is puzzling to me that he has adopted the attitude that immigrants represent the lowest rung on the ladder of primates.

After having worked in an international strategic communications company that represented "big tobacco," I recognize too many pages from the same playbook: Discredit longstanding, verifiable facts using paid, obfuscating scientists... Set up meaningless foundations that purport to present new thought and research ...Develop lists of those who will trumpet your cause, support them, and damn those who will not....Spend billions of dollars proclaiming your innocence, millions more pleading mea culpa, and then billions as you fight governments (EU) trying to impose neutral Plain Packaging.  (For you Americans, Plain Packaging is the government attempt to reduce brand logos and fill resulting space with anti-tobacco messages and graphic images to reduce smoking.  While the tobacco companies claim "no destruction of private property (ie, trademarks) without due compensation," they seem to forget that it is governments who have picked up their health-care debris. Against all odds and with eminent threats of suits, governments of France, the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, et al have adopted Plain Packaging legislation.)  Big Sugar has seen what has happened to Big Tobacco.  Let the battle begin!

Workers who are dissatisfied with their circumstance must seek a new path. Individual action trumps collective disarray.<br/>Make a plan.<br/>Waiting and hoping is not a plan.<br/>Save some money and aggressively seek a new situation.<br/>If you do not find one, keep saving money, uproot yourself and move.<br/>Take action...*change* something.<br/>Nothing will happen if you do nothing.<br/>I've heard all of the excuses as to why people cannot save money, by the way.<br/>Guess what?<br/>The more people earn, the more they spend and the more debt they carry, on average...simple fact. When people get more money, they typically do not save it. No matter what their income, the majority claim they cannot save.<br/>Sorry, does not compute.<br/>Not happy?<br/>Make a plan, save some money and *quit*!

Thank you for this and thank you to the NYT for this series. There is an art to helping people without making them feel bad or humiliated. I struggle with this daily as i care for my parents. One thing I have learned: for some people holding on to their dignity trumps everything. It can be very hard respecting those wishes when you see that they really need to walk with a cane and stop driving.  Caring for my parents is the hardest, most heartbreaking and most meaningful thing I have ever done. I feel lucky that I have the flexibility to do this for them.

Right. A woman who is so desperate for money that she resorts to prostitution needs "privacy" (not social assistance; I suppose that would create "dependency"). Privacy for the , what, maybe 10% at most, of women who have freely chosen this type of employment trumps the needs of all the others who are either coerced or tricked or lured into it? I agree the women should not be prosecuted; probably just the johns. But in most cases, "privacy" is just protection for the pimps and johns.

It means I wanted to see what a bad idea that was<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>I see ads for some stupid game and have never downloaded any games and never intend to.<br/><br/>I never see ads for stuff that I WOULD buy (like a recording of symphonies by Vaughan Williams or music for recorder consort)

All the Deomcrats are proposing is making it somewhat easier for individuals to finance the high cost of college, but they offer nothing about curbing or even rolling back the annual increases in tuition. Anyone serious about the cost of college has identified the proliferation of non-teaching administrators as a driver of higher costs. And why the proliferation? In part to deal with the regulatory requirements imposed on colleges by the federal government. And what party is a leading proponent of federal intrusion into college life? That's right, the Democratic Party. <br/><br/>Pretty ingenious, no? Advocate for policies that raise the cost of education and then trumpet your proposals for cost-shifting to help finance a college education. Some folks see through this ploy but as this editorial shows, there are always those who champion the cost-shifters instead of the cost-cutters.

I'll soon be 89 years old. I've seen both parties come and go. Several years ago, I finally came to the conclusion: Ideology trumps rationality, regardless of what constituents call themselves. This applies to many sociocultural areas beyond politics. I don't forecast any significant change for several decades to come.

Let me answer that if I may.  I'd say that being a  defenseless Jew in a concentration camp trumps being a German soldier during WWI.  At  least the soldier was well  armed with his rifle and only wanted to serve the Fatherland and his Kaiser against the enemy.  The innocent  Jew had no weapons and was fooled by a cunning enemy that he  was being transported "east" away from the war.  The Jew didn't know what was happening until he was shoved into a fake shower and deadly Zykon gas was coming out of the fake shower heads.  I hope that helps.

At this point, what is clear is that international high finance trumps democracy. Tsipras' party Syriza was elected specifically with the agenda of denying the repeated demands for austerity, and it sure seemed like they were sincere in that plan. Then they put austerity terms to a vote, and "no" won handily (with the population aware of at least the publicly threatened consequences).<br/><br/>Then Tsipras accepted the austerity terms anyways. That tells me that behind the scenes there were more severe threats than the economic devastation Tsipras knew fully well would result.<br/><br/>The Germans, for their part, seem to be more interested in forcing Syriza from power than they are in helping Greece recover or even getting their money back. Their great fear, by all appearances, is not just that Syriza gets what they campaigned on, but that citizens of other countries devastated by austerity (Spain, Portugal, Ireland, to a lesser degree the UK) might also consider electing left-wing governments.

This kind of opinion piece is exactly what comes from not pre-defining what codified moral system we're working with.  The underlying assumption is that the right to privacy supersedes most other moral tenets.  But its limited scope is too problematic.  <br/><br/>The practical and theoretical failure to this argument is not all that hard to point out.  We have, somewhat arbitrarily, selected 17 as the age cut-off for statutory rape in New York.  What is the inerrant grounding for this age cut-off?  If a 17 year-old advertises sex for money, does the right to privacy protect her and her customer?  <br/><br/>What if we decide to move the age cut-off down?  Since it's somewhat arbitrary, this might happen.  16?  15?  12?  Would privacy rights trump all other considerations then?  Is this application as fluid as it seems, adjusting to the agreed upon laws of other cultures where having sex with children is effectively sanctioned (apropos child marriage)?  <br/><br/>If the practical application of a "supreme" moral tenet fails once, then clearly it has no place being at the top of whatever moral code is being espoused.  Morality asserts that we are meant to relate to each other in certain defined ways, ways that ensure that people flourish not just physically, but ultimately psychologically and metaphysically.  At the very best, defining the right to privacy as important without subsequently defining in detail all other rights that exist in that moral framework is incomplete, and at worst, poison.

Political bias trumps open-minded investigation at wattsupwiththat. Moving on from noting that sociopathy no longer hides itself; Mr. Trump demonstrates that ego without self-awareness is now socially acceptable, no matter how many people it hurts (e.g., indefensible Drudge ugliness).<br/><br/>"Following the major media splash around 2014 ‘Hottest Year” designation, .... what manufactured, cooked up diversion would be coming from the evil elves in the climate denial workshop."<br/><br/>"Two weeks ago, under the headline “How we are being tricked by flawed data on global warming” ... Paul Homewood ... Notalotofpeopleknowthat blog, had checked the published temperature graphs for three (three! golly!) weather stations in Paraguay against the temperatures that had originally been recorded. In each instance, the actual trend of 60 years of data had been dramatically reversed, so that a cooling trend was changed to one that showed a marked warming."<br/><br/>"The latest salvo in the War on Reality comes from the UK paper The Telegraph, which is a safe haven for some who would claim ... that global warming isn’t real."<br/><br/>"Christopher Booker (who flat out denies human-induced global warming), is somewhat subtly titled “The fiddling with temperature data is the biggest science scandal ever”. .... The theme of the article is that scientists “manipulated” the data on purpose to exaggerate global warming.<br/><br/>"scientists didn’t manipulate the data, they processed it."<br/><br/>more here:<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/n4tje2r" title="http://tinyurl.com/n4tje2r" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/n4tje2r</a>

Schumer is a poor example, his self- interest trumping national and international security. Sanders has a growing popularity and is highly respected, unlike the Republican  hit job on Donald Trump executed by Fix News.

True, the El Donaldo seems like a different phenom than previously advertised, with there having been no decline in his poll numbers taken since the ' debate ' - it's increasingly likely that he appeals to the same groups that liked Perot in '92, though that's probably the only comparison between the two candidates that would apply.<br/><br/>It was striking to us that none of the ' debate ' moderators asked DT about his lack of political experience and why he thought the Oval Office to be an entry level position, requiring not even being an apprentice-ship (couldn't resist the pun); what parts of his resume would indicate any proclivity towards working in our political system for 4 years ?<br/><br/>By not drawing this contrast, and putting El Donaldo front and center, Faux Noise Machina got a ratings coup, which they knew they could expect from when they have ' trumpeted ' DT before, helping Faux Noise along on their project to destroy the relevance of early state primaries.<br/><br/>Democrats need to be working to place the counter-narrative that whatever person is eventually picked to be the hood ornament on the rolling dumpster fire that is the GOP, they will still be wagged around by the far right wing of the party, with every potential candidate promising to take the country backwards to ' more of the same ' policies that got us in such a pinch from 2000-08.<br/><br/>GOP'ers are scared to death of a large '16 turn-out of Democrats, when GOP'ers have to defend 24 Senate seats; the Senate could flip :)

  Economic justice and opportunity IS the foundation of any democracy, NOT racial and sexual identity politics which further fractures the "us" into many sub-groups.<br/> These sexual/racial identity hijackers of the party need to stop their navel gazing and look at the bigger picture.  Of course racial justice and sexual identity  are important, but they are a very NARROW lens from which to view the future of America. Economic opportunity trumps EVERYTHING.<br/>I hope Warren and Saunders supporters push back HARD on all economic issues within the party and stop the emotionalism of this minority.

1004
Stupid moves like this are what gives Democrats a bad name with moderates and conservatives.  It's a dumb political move and focused too much on personal issues.  Instead of disavowing past names start trumping up present ones and focus on unifying, leadership and doing what the Republicans do best,  poking (big) holes at the attitude and leadership of the other team (past and present).  This will get the Democratic Party nowhere, except the smug satisfaction of those who started this trend.

The Harper government has been producing campaign ads thinly disguised as "This is a message from the Government of Canada"for months. These, of course, are paid for by taxpayers.  Right now the Harper government is trying to trump up hysteria over a minimal terrorist threat (all the "terrorists" to date have been victims of serious mental illness) to further persuade Canadians that we need to keep the Tories in power, and also in the hope that it will make us forget such things as loss of home mail delivery, suppression of free speech, undermining of science, bulldozing through major policy changes without Parliamentary debate, and other things that the Tories are NOT celebrating as "This is a message from the Government of Canada." We can only hope that enough Canadians are turned off by this and many other actions to choose another party to govern.

I'm continually bothered by the widespread denial of how racism has been baked into our governmental and regulatory systems (systemic racism).  <br/><br/>It is possible for whites so inclined to keep their interactions with blacks to a minimum. So doing, it becomes easy for them to not to hear or see firsthand the devastating effects of this systemic racism.<br/><br/>It would be naive to think that nowadays any system is going to trumpet its injustices towards any segment of the population.  On the contrary, we can only expect that a system by default will insist that it is working just fine and its treatment of all concerned is just fine.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is necessary, if one wants to approach the truth of the situation, to proactively seek it out.  For those who have been comfortable with thinking that there is something inherently deficient in blacks that is the cause of all their problems, I would not expect them to come easily or delightedly to the truth.<br/><br/>But I would applaud them for doing so.  And to make the process of enlightenment as palatable as possible, I have a recommendation.  A process as deep and pervasive as structural racism over the past 150 years, and how it is manifesting today, is worthy of several books, and they have been written.<br/><br/>But for a thoughtful, comprehensive, and unabrasive article overview of the long-term and continuing damage, I recommend "The Case for Reparations" by Ta-Nehisi Coates: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lfd5thu" title="http://tinyurl.com/lfd5thu" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/lfd5thu</a>

PK: Here's a recent demographic analysis of his supporters: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-are-donald-trumps-supporters-2015-7" title="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-are-donald-trumps-supporters-2015-7" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/who-are-donald-trumps-supporters-2015-7</a><br/><br/>Here is a demographic summary from the article:<br/><br/>"In Trump's case, he appears to be cornering the market on white voters, the backbone of the current Republican Party, the poll shows," he wrote. "Republicans need as many white votes as possible to offset demographic shifts in the United States that have handed Democrats an electoral advantage in the last two presidential elections."<br/><br/>"A Quinnipiac University poll of the Republican primary this week also found that Trump performed better with men than woman. Trump got 24% of the male vote and 15% of the female vote — a noticeable gap, though he still had more support between both sexes than any of his GOP rivals.<br/><br/>Trump performed more or less evenly across the board when it came to the ideological spectrum of voters. The Quinnipiac survey found that Trump had the plurality among self-identified tea party (23%), evangelical (20%), very conservative (20%), somewhat conservative (24%), and moderate/liberal (17%) Republican voters."<br/><br/>That said, I love "the DTs." That's what they are: Rs' have delirium tremens for The Donald.

1008
It's a good theory also because other researchers who have looked closely at the Tea Party have found they tend to be Ayn Rand followers.  Gary Weiss, for example, author of the book "Ayn Rand Nation" published in 2012 made this point but he's not the only one.<br/><br/>The connection to Trump is obvious.  His image is closer than any other candidate to a typical Ayn Rand hero being first and foremost a very wealthy super confident businessman who claims he knows how to solve every problem that stumps conventional politicians.  That he has given no specifics is not a problem for the true believers.  And his TV show "The Apprentice" has been praised by leading figures in the Objectivist movement such as Harry Binswanger who wrote this article published in 2004:<br/><br/><a href="http://capitalismmagazine.com/2004/04/donald-trump-and-the-apprentice-concretization-of-the-american-dream/" title="http://capitalismmagazine.com/2004/04/donald-trump-and-the-apprentice-concretization-of-the-american-dream/" target="_blank">http://capitalismmagazine.com/2004/04/donald-trump-and-the-apprentice-co...</a>

DT (sounds like a toxic chemical doesn't it?) is the equivalent of the South African apartheid politicians/rulers.  They are neither elite or leaders. They are white and entitled. Period. That's who supports DT. They have automatic affinity.  And no amount of reasoning, facts or calls to their own humanity will ever trump their sense of automatic entitlement because they are white. They are white and they are entitled. Period.

"What characteristics predispose someone to like this guy, as opposed to accepting the establishment candidates?"<br/><br/>well you don't have to really go beyond what trump supporters themselves say; they are very angry with the gop establishment for failing to repeal or defund obamacare, seal the border and claw back numerous obama executive actions. this is the fundamental basis of their anger. the gop did well enough in the elections to control congress in the 2012/2014 elections but have failed to deliver on their campaign promises as noted above. much of their base feels deceived.<br/><br/>many trump supporters are tea party members with this anger dynamic; the racial element may have some minor impact but far from significance.  

1012
Why is this even news?<br/><br/>Mix a witches brew of fear (and that ingredient is as common as salt, sugar and fat combined), power, media madness and political pandering and ... well, whatever needs to be done will be done to keep citizens "safe."   Not to mention careers.<br/><br/>Let's stop pretending that humanity and empathy will EVER trump safety, safety, safety.  Except, of course, when we get to sit in self-righteous judgment and indignation from a (very) safe distance. 

1013
Yeah, and we can be confident that these convicted murders are not at all upset about loosing their hard earned honor privileges and would never trump the whole thing up against the guards. Where would prisoners find the time to work up a story like that.  Salt of the earth diligent individuals that these murders are. Working overtime in the leather shop. If only the guards had more humanity. Clearly each and every claim by these murders is true and correct.

Nancy, if you are still around, my apologies for not responding earlier.  You sound like a very genuine person, full of heart and caring, but confused by all the scientific matter.  I am a Nobel physicist's daughter, and did rather well at MIT before I quit, and have met quite a wide variety of top scientists, it would not be exaggerating to say dozens of Nobelists. I look at these with an artist's eye, that being my particular skill; even if his daughter, I don't have a clue as to physics, except that I know whom to trust and whom not to trust.<br/><br/>Try the old lady kicking the tires approach.<br/><br/>As for living, I'd recommend just doing it.  Our moral compass is so distorted we seem ready to accept ugly selfish people (Trump = Monckton) as authorities, but scientists are weird too.<br/><br/>So as one of my father's neighbors has on her apartment door: "live, laugh, love".  My advice: do what you can, and leave the rest.  There's some hope that we will acknowledge our common humanity before we trash the planet completely.<br/><br/>I worry about those algae (and jellyfish) blooms because they are signposts to me (also wildfires).  I like Earth Observatory and planetary images because they are visual, and that's the imagery I understand best.  But in the end, we can only hope that our common humanity will trump all the selfishness, stupidity and addiction to small short-term excitements we have come to substitute for the direct small pleasure of real life itself.

Pavlov's dogs occasionally refused a treat, the cable news and political web sites NEVER refuse the Trump treat.  On study said CNN said "donald trump" over 250 times one day.  He will not be the president, he reminds me of any big fish in a small town real estate developer getting yuks from an all male entourage of lawyers, contractors and govt officials at some dinner after a town meeting.  All bluster, all generalities, a smattering of racial remarks and sexist remarks and nothing of substance.  Please stop it so the country can move on with business

1018
So calling various women "pigs" and implying that a reporter was just hormonal when she questions his views/past actions towards women is now "fresh honest air"?<br/><br/>Because, for the sake of fresh honest air, can we just admit that Donald trump did not mean "nose" when he said that Kelly had "blood coming out of her wherever"?

He may be boorish and perhaps misogynistic, he may be a clown or whatever.  He is way up there in the field though, and when I  watched that debate it felt that they were very much trying to take him down many notches, which was not their job.  I saw it and felt at the time that she reserved a different level of toughness for trump.  That has no place in moderating a debate.

1020
We are spending too much time analyzing everything Trump says, and not enough time watching what he is doing. <br/><br/>An article in the WSJ today reveals that Trump's campaign manager who recently quit/was fired complained openly about the candidate's refusal to spend money on very obvious things: ad buys, grassroots organization, and even filing paperwork to ensure his name appears on the ballot in all 50 states.<br/>(<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-is-frugal...)" title="http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-is-frugal...)" target="_blank">http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-is-frugal...)</a> <br/><br/>Romney had to spend $390 million in 2012, just to secure the Republican nomination. And he wasn't running against the establishment favorite, and he did not pick a fight with FOX. For Trump to win this election, he will likely have to spend $750 million of his own money.<br/><br/>And yet there he is, counting pennies, having spent less than $1 million of his own money so far, content to make his appointments with the various news organizations that will hand him a microphone for free.<br/><br/>We'll know Trump is serious when he spends over $50 million of his own money. Watch what he does.

As a member of "the left", let me set you straight on a couple of things:<br/>1. I hope to GOD he gets the nomination. You members of "the right" think too much in a vacuum. Have you heard ANY of us hoping to God that he gets the nod? Stephen Colbert is the latest one to do just that. Get trump into a general election, and he gets plastered. Absolutely plastered. It is the right that is scared to death that that happens. Because they know the result will be the same: 4 more years of a democratic POTUS.<br/>2. Yep, he means it, when he says he will build a wall between mexico and us. (Personally, I'd say give texas back to mexico - a firewall of loopies between us and Mexico is better than any wall, any day.) But you must remember: Trump can demand it, but he doesn't hold the purse strings. That's up to congress. And since its congress's responsibility, I'm sure it will happen immediately. (Last statement made dripping with sarcasm.)<br/>3. I've never heard any media pundits say they never watch Faux News. I think they have to, no matter how much it may make them wretch. Kind of like opposition research in any profession. 

1027
The crazy guy down the street from me who yells out his window that Obama is the antichrist to anyone who comes within 50ft of his house also speaks "openly, bluntly, and honestly from the heart". But that doesn't mean I'd vote for the guy. He's nuts. Trump is too.<br/><br/>There is a place for businessmen - in business. But we need a POTUS who will not unthoughtfully throw rhetorical grenades at every turn. If trump were to become POTUS, we'd have no allies left. He'd alienate every last one of them. Trump's supporters seem to think that the Bush doctrine of cowboy unilateralism is exactly what we need. Were they sleeping from 2000 to 2007? 

1028
President Obama's letter is important not just to protect the voting rights of all eligible American voters, but also USA's authority internationally. <br/><br/>USA's democratic ethos need confirmation to a skeptical world. In a world in which USA's internal 'good' helps to project its power internationally, protecting voters' rights, as is solving its persistent Police Force/African-Americans' imbroglio, should actually be National security issues. Its many international foes, and indeed admirers, need to indeed affirm the USA as the land of the 'free' in which opportunities for all abound -irrespective of race, skin colour or culture; rather than where opportunities are aplenty for some; but for some others, state-sponsored injustices and terror reign.<br/><br/>Relative to its competitors, the USA enjoys far more economic, technological, educational, socio-cultural and trumpeted democratic advantages. But they are stunted by perceived voting suppression of minorities -which blows holes through USA's democratic credence; and its traditional fixation with conflicts -which induce falsehoods in war victims that its advantages were derived at their expense! <br/><br/>If President Obama's 'right-of-voters' plea is heeded, and the USA become less fixated on worldwide conflicts' -by using its massive authority to support the already-proposed modes for obtaining worldwide war prevention; then, USA's global leadership would prosper unhindered; and with far less terror-foes than it currently possesses.

@New Member: that's how I used to make ice cream as a kid! (although there was an old electric motor involved). I don't know if it was the ingredients used, or my memory tricking me, but it seems the rudimentary technology used then made much better ice cream (my specialty was peach, made with almost-too-ripe peaches) than the specialized Magimix ice cream maker I bought only a few years ago. I eventually gave up making my own, and let Häagen-Dazs or Ben &amp; Jerry make it for me instead: the joy of creating my own didn't manage to trump the satisfaction of eating actually good ice cream.

Thank you for sharing. I can't imagine being apart from my husband for more than a day, so this was heartbreaking to read. You also embody hope and show all that love trumps distance.

I can appreciate the uneasiness about states' rights.  But every individual's right to vote trumps that unease.  This must be a bottom-up fix.  And if certain states can't dish out, maintain and continue improving that fix, the nation as a whole must do it for them.

1033
Susan, please take the time to review for yourself the infamous 2013 Cooke et al “97% consensus” Anthropogenic Global Warming paper linked in the article.  It clearly shows, despite what anyone attributes to it, that most scientists, like myself, "take no position on AGW.” This can be seen in the both the data, for example in the first graph the black “take no position on AGW” line is above the green "endorse" line, not below.  Also, the authors note, “_Over time, the no position percentage has increased and the percentage of papers taking a position on AGW has equally decreased._”<br/><br/>Now, note that the question Cooke et al effectively asked was “Could AGW be true?” not “Has AGW been proven?”  That is a big difference in logic.  Furthermore, the two concepts are not mutually exclusive.  For example, I believe “AGW could be true but certainly hasn’t yet been proven.”  Did Cooke et al purposefully conflate the two ideas?  From multiple readings of this paper, I conclude they did.  <br/><br/>BTW, you mentioned that you were a friend of Feynman.  We probably agree that Feynman would be on the side of using scientific methods.   Please read the paper and let us know if you think the authors purposefully avoided scientific methods to make their point.  Or, at the very least, drew &amp; trumpeted conclusions not supported by their own data.

The problem is not drug use per se. Since the beginning of man, man has tried to alter his/her state of mind. THis will not end. We have to accept this reality, and move forward with a solution that is not what we are attempting today. Developed nations aren't the only ones with drug users. We're just the ones that have the most disposable income to spend on drugs. <br/><br/>The real problem is that we have entire industries dependent on the war on drugs. Much as we do dependent on war period. The DEA, prison guards, police apparatus, etc do not want the war on drugs to change one bit. Even though their combined efforts and billions of dollars spent annually do effectively nothing to stem the flow of drugs into our country...The real problem is not the use of drugs, because there is no real solution to that. Eventually, we'll have to accept this, and change tactics. The main problem, which is something that plagues this  country so often, is that individual interests trump the interest of society as a whole. So those that profit from the so called war on drugs want status quo, despite clear cut evidence that that model doesn't work. Until we can collectively agree this has to change, at the cost of those profiting from the 'war' losing out on their spoils, nothing will change. And those poor souls in that near failed state of Mexico will suffer the consequences, because we sure do love our cocaine and weed and meth and heron and everything else we can get our snouts on...

1036
Who threatens America? Russia and China, with their nuclear arsenals, and radical Sunni Wahhabi/Salafist Islamists. ISIS and Al Qaeda are manifestations of Wahhabism. Wahhabi sects dominate all of the gulf monarchies, they are the official religion there, and enforce sharia law there. If we wish to identify the location, the nations, the economies of these terrorists groups we need only look to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, etc.<br/>We do not address these educators and financiers because of our economic ties to them. They have lots of oil, cheap to pump oil, and oodles of cash, and lots of investments in the west, and "interlocking boards of directors". That's why Bush attacked Iraq even though 15 of 19 terrorists who attacked America on 9/11 were Saudi, and Al Qaeda was Saudi funded. Bush was tied to King Abdullah, so he could not attack the Saudis. We are still not attacking the gulf monarchies because our concern for peace is trumped by our financial entanglements with the gulf monarchies.<br/>Americans are the dupes of business interests. We are deceived into thinking Iran is the problem.....in ten years they may have a bomb. The Pakistanis already have a nuclear arsenal. We should be more afraid of that. They are unstable, untrustworthy, and already provide safe haven for Al Qaeda. Bin Laden hid in Pakistan, near a military base.<br/>Iran is not our enemy, but we have been theirs.  

1037
It's really GREAT that Trump is making politics POPULAR! When did debates get any viewers and ratings? NEVER. Now people are attracted because this is a train wreck and people love NASCAR accidents and hockey fights. So maybe ore people will now register and vote in caucuses, primaries and next November. Just see Trump as a "vector" to make Americans more politically motivated. Those of you who worry, don't forget, 75% of Republican likely voters are NOT in favor of trump. 

1038
when will we in the USA, wake up and realize, that we are in a cold war with the red chinese government? how about the massive cyberwar going on? this devaluation is another salvo directed at the economy of the USA, and purposely done. the massive spending on chinese military. chinese government shell corps. buying up massive amounts of companies in the usa, that control the infrastructure, energy, and other companies, that will cripple us, in a cyber second. and no, trump will be a wet noodle to the chinese, they chinese have thousands of years of experience in dealing with flash in the pans. next year will make 2008 look like a picnic......

He stated to a New York Times reporter that “When you’re dealing, and that’s what I am, I’m a dealer, you don’t go in with plans...”. To me, the idea of having a President who goes into all of his negotiations without a plan is unsettling. During his campaign Trump has also stated “I am the most fabulous whiner. I do whine because I want to win. And I’m not happy when I’m not winning. I am a whiner. And I keep whining and whining until I win." sounding more like a bratty child then someone suitable to lead a country. There are many more things Trump has done before and during his campaign that I feel makes him an inadequate candidate for the presidency, like the fact that he as insulted competitors via Twitter, very immature, is trying to cover up his feud with Fox News's top anchor, Megyn Kelly, due to him making a reference, to what most believe to be, her menstrual cycle after she asked him about a former comment in which he referred to women as "dogs and pigs", and the fact that you can already tell that his Presidency would be full of empty promises as reporters have asked about what specifics he was offering to fix the economy and foreign policy he insists are so badly broken to which he replied “I think you’re going to see lots of plans."

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/us/politics/intent-on-life-after-fox-trump-turns-to-policy.html?ref=us" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/us/politics/intent-on-life-after-fox-trump-turns-to-policy.html?ref=us" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/us/politics/intent-on-life-after-fox-t...</a><br/><br/>When I first heard that Donald Trump was running for President, I thought it was a joke. Seeing as it has been almost two months since he launched his campaign, and how he and his team are actually working on it, my fear for this country's future has never been worse. I feel as though I would have been fine if I had not just read in this article that "he has risen in the polls". How this has happened, I do not know, but the fact that there is a large enough group of people who believe in what he is saying makes me a little sick to my stomach. Don't get me wrong, I understand and respect that people have different believes and that everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I have never felt so strongly against something as I do his campaign. Based on the article, you can just tell how unserious he is taking the situation, proven by his answer to the question "Plans to combat the Islamic State?" to which he replied "We go in, we knock the hell out of ’em, we take the oil,". You are also shown how unorganized his entire campaign is when they explain how he began to ramble on and on after being asked "So how do you fix it?". Before I found this article I was already against the idea of Trump running , but after reading this my opposition on the matter has increased tremendously. I feel as though his points on why he would be able to "Make America Great Again" are not 1/2

1043
TRUMP! The very name suggests advantage, like a trump card. (From TRIUMPH) But ultimately, America  needs something more than The Donald.<br/>============================================<br/>I think that Hillary holds the best trump card. She can become the first woman president, setting a huge precedent. She has a vast amount of experience, more than all the other candidates, combined.

1044
A defendant has a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. In this case, it seems to me that Mr. Bharadia's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to have the gloves tested. A key piece of evidence that could have exonerated Mr. Bharadia. With the DNA evidence from the gloves now pointing to Mr. Flint as the perpetrator, there is clear prejudice to Mr. Bharadia. He should receive a new trial on that basis. Finality of convictions should NEVER trump the ability of defendants to present evidence showing that they are factually innocent of the crime of which they were convicted. 

1045
Blame the press for trumpeting 'voter fraud' protection when the Republican ID laws are ONLY about stopping non-existent voter impersonation. Perhaps, its political advantage more than race. Press: Speak the facts!

1046
Going to the race card awful early, aren't you Paul?  I mean, you win a prize for an obscure economics theory and suddenly you throw game theory out the window and pull out the classic "trump" Democratic card?  You must be a heckuva bridge player.  But I'll raise you 2 no Trump.

1047
I would never vote for trump, but I find him endlessly entertaining.<br/><br/>Why?  Because he's just so un PC.  He battles with the Republican establishment, and I'm glad to see it.<br/><br/>So, no, I won't vote for him.  Not ever.  The Democrats have my vote.  But I hope he stays in the race a long time, because he makes it entertaining.  I'll keep mentioning him because I hope he's the Republican candidate.<br/><br/>Shake it up a bit.  He won't win anyway.  I only joke about it.

1048
No war, FOX and other media made Trump the star of the political theater they love to cover for the sake of ratings as described here:<br/><a href="http://www.reflectivepundit.com/reflectivepundit/2015/08/rhetorical-bomb-throwing-as-public-entertainment-news-media-political-theater-and-reality-tv-star-trump.html" title="http://www.reflectivepundit.com/reflectivepundit/2015/08/rhetorical-bomb-throwing-as-public-entertainment-news-media-political-theater-and-reality-tv-star-trump.html" target="_blank">http://www.reflectivepundit.com/reflectivepundit/2015/08/rhetorical-bomb...</a>

If fox news endures any pain in handling the trumping of the GOP, it is just desserts to an organization that has let slip its dogs on American government. This organization has created  an arrogant, self-righteous, fear- mongering, Obama/Hillary-bashing agenda that is nothing aligned with the ideals for which our forebears fought. Like Iago, these snakes have preyed upon the goodwill of its viewers to perpetrate fraud and lead us to  elect stooges while disparaging honest public servants who have an idea or two about what we need for our children's future . That mr.trump has spewed his venom at and with them is poetic justice that is as tragic as it is comic.

1051
Donald Trump could go all the way (No pun) if he is not a stalking horse for Clintonista Ltd.  I believe his New York (circa Queensisms) and plain-spokenness trumps (again No pun) the rest of this underachieving bunch of republican losers. See his personality is infectious; hes acerbic and so am I.  Lets see what job could Bill and Hil offer: Ambassador to the UN-unlikely, Secretary of Commerce or Labor mabye.

1052
As Nate Silver wrote today, Donald Trump is winning the polls and losing the nomination.<br/><br/>He concluded, "Trump will not win the nomination. It’s not even clear that he’s trying to do so."<br/><br/>Here's a link to the article:  <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-winning-the-polls-and-losing-the-nomination-2/" title="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-winning-the-polls-and-losing-the-nomination-2/" target="_blank">http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-winning-the-polls-and...</a>

1053
Well, I also applaud trump but couldn't disagree with you more.  Our government is far from what it could and probably should be but it is actually quite functional. Shumer is a hack and is not representing the views of his constituents and he is going to need all that political operative savvy to stay in office. 

1054
Oh DCBarrister, this is your self-loathing moment in the sun! Responding directly to Barack Obama, the black guy you love to hate! <br/><br/>Obama has championed legislation that has withstood multiple challenges in the US Supreme Court. Obama successfully nominated two of the sitting justices on this court. I cannot silently sit here while you assume to claim superior knowledge of the intent and machinations of our system of government, to that of our highly tested President.  You seriously want to measure your resume against Barack Obama's? Remind us which constitutional law review you edited? You lose.<br/><br/>What is your response to the anecdotal evidence filling these comments, of present-day systemic voter disenfranchisement? Or the youtube clips of Republican elected officials saying that voter ID laws are intended to reduce Democratic voter participation. <br/><br/>It's imaginary?<br/><br/>Your lack of personal experience with this issue means you have no credibility on the topic, and the fact that you trumpet your race card in every post, further diminishes your legitimacy.

1055
To amplify on Stephen's reply, a Berkeley physicist a few years back proclaimed that the NOAA was doing it all wrong and global warming was not real. He got the money to do a 2 year study and and the end his conclusion (unfortunately not trumpeted by the media, and I don't have a link immediately available) was that the NOAA figures were entirely correct. But of course you know even more than this Berkeley physicist does.

1056
James,<br/>Where is your scientific research showing that this is a myth and trumped up.  Please where is you decades of research.  You are correct when all of the top scientist in the world are wrong.  Your arrogance and lack of any evidence to back up your terminally stupid claims are frightening.<br/>Any one with any sense of cause and effect you don't have to be a physicist know that we are in much more trouble than anyone predicted.  If you think humans, all 7 billion of us don't leave a impact or a mark on the earth than there really is no hope for you or anyone else.

1057
Nate Silver "emphatically" predicts that Trump won't be the nominee, although he says that "Even this far out, a candidate near the top of the polls is a somewhat better bet to win the nomination than one near the bottom."<br/><br/>Many NYT commentators have simply been stating that he won't be the nominee.  However, Rachel Maddow wrote a piece after forming the opposite conclusion: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rachel-maddow-donald-trump-unelectable_55bb76e5e4b0d4f33a02510" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rachel-maddow-donald-trump-unelectable_55bb76e5e4b0d4f33a02510" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rachel-maddow-donald-trump-unelectab...</a><br/><br/>In any event it is sure to be interesting.

When Fiorina ran HP there was a LOT of problems and controversy, it wasn't smooth running at all !<br/><br/>It would be BIG mistake to presume that she could compete with trump for charisma, toughness and expertise.<br/><br/>Trump would make a great potus, anyone who can accumalte a 10 billion $ empire like he has done has this writers respect.<br/><br/>Sure he is crude, abusive, ego driven and boisterous.....well that fits right in with the American way right...so what's the problem ? all the others are just hopeful wannabes who are trying to climb into the Oval office armchair with limited intellect or leadership credibility !<br/><br/>Trump's the man who could make America great again !

1060
Duh. It takes research to figure this out? Money trumps everything in the corporate feudal world. Rise up or be trod into the dirt.

1061
Nice try, but by next week TM (Trump Misogyny) will have faded into the background. The Bombastic One will have blustered on to something else - and THAT will be dominating the headlines. Besides, Fiorina can stand up to Trump in the eyes of the 75% of Republicans who already can't stand him -- but she'll only aggravate the 25% who are trump supporters -- they aren't the type who warm up to aggressive women folk.  

1062
I am with Harvey and Hanson on this; it was a total violation of privacy.  And I hate it, plain and simple.  It isn't always a good thing that so many tools are in the hands of the police, especially when you consider most of the news lately about how they are handling the tools they already have.  What the cops need doesn't trump what the citizens need, not in my understanding of the 4th amendment.  Come on ACLU et al.  Stop them before we can't.    

1063
I'm just offering my insights on how politics works. By your very presence here, you are by Def  not the norm. Women just don't care. And if they do care, like u, u sint voting rep snywsy. Is that too hard to comprehend?  Look at what happened ed in a cold dispassionate manner and you'll see, trump s coming out a winner on this. He's leading in actual poll of Iowa voters.  See?

1064
If we define "trumpism" as "style over substance" then Donald quite accurately senses that Carly can out-trump him.  

1065
This is so intensely repulsive that I could read it only in installments.  It speaks volumes of ISIS and slave masters, but what does it say more broadly of the practice of allowing truth texts to trump common secular values of decency?  

1066
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/peter-wehner-president-donald-trump-just-say-no.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/peter-wehner-president-donald-trump-just-say-no.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/peter-wehner-president-donald-...</a><br/>This article is about republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and why he shouldn't be president. I picked it because I totally agree with the author of this article, I really don't think he should be. He has been in the news a lot recently and he is leading in the national polls. Honestly, I have no idea why people want him to be president. From what I've seen of him, he would make a terrible president. When he announced that was running for president, he said that he was worth 8.7 billion dollars and then he kept going on about how rich he is, as if that somehow qualifies him to be a good president. When he was asked how he was going to defeat ISIS, he said he had a foolproof plan to defeat them very quickly but he didn't want to tell it because he didn't want ISIS to know it before he attacked. He also said that he would keep a nuclear weapon away from Iran, but he never said how. He said "there's no one bigger and better at the military than i am" "I get things done better than anybody" and "I will be the greatest jobs president God has ever created" all without explaining how. He also insulted Mexicans by saying that most of the people coming from there are rapists and drug dealers, and he "assumes that some are good people". Not to mention that he calls people who don't agree with him "losers" "jerks" and "dummies" Do you really want a guy like this running our country? 

1067
"practice of allowing truth texts to trump common secular values of decency"<br/><br/>Where do you think "common secular values of decency" came from?  Do you subscribe to "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"? Guess where that came from?  Do you think "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone" was invented by a secularist?  Do you endorse the actions of a Good Samaritan? How about "Love your enemies," "Go the extra mile," "Turn the other cheek," "Love your neighbor as yourself"? Do you even know the origin of these "values of decency"?

1068
You can't compare Isis with trump

1069
It's really quite simple: Truth texts ("gospels") by definition trump everything in their path, and allow no exceptions. That is why they are false. Believing in absurdities (an all powerful deity) creates these cruel atrocities. Every time. 

1070
Those who define themselves as Jewish or Christian may not support these atrocities but, let's face it, they came to these conclusions because, over time, secular reasoning trumped their ancient scriptures.

1071
You call this freedom, this hamster cage. Wasting our years in the vain hope to find some vindication in our endurance.<br/>The ISIS is freedom. It is another freedom, not our kind.<br/>But we trump this distorted muslim califat far more than donald trumps this distorted republicans. You are worried about some thousands that went astray ? Just ask the some thousands that risk their life every day just to get into our countries.<br/>We are not perfect, we cannot comply to all people, some will ward off, we should just get content with that. But if the ISIS recruits some stupid kids, we can recruit whole societies.

1072
And so went Rome, from the greatest power on earth to a minor player.<br/><br/>When you have the backing of other major players in the question, you would be foolish to thumb your nose at them just to pacify one misguided leader whose only aim if to rule the world using our money and blood. The US must not allow Netanyahu to talk us into another skirmish that will be out and out war to the end just to satisfy his political ambitions.<br/><br/>All those US politicians who are following Netanyahu's lead rather than sense and the lead of the US and western Europe are guilty of just exactly what certain agitators feared about President Kennedy--that he possibly might allow his religion to trump his guidance of the US. These politicians who now are voting their religion over giving peace a chance are guilty of just that. Schumer just lost all respect I had for him. <br/><br/>This deal is the best possible, It is supported by UK, France, Germany among others, the US should support it too.

1073
Well it looks like they will get first hand experience with the gun insanity epidemic running through out our country. One good shoot out with a few dead state lawmakers may finally trump the NRA's hand when the next vote is taken there to allow concealed hand guns in public places.  Trying to make sense out of non-sense sure is perplexing, wouldn't you say!!

1074
To our friend in Zurich, to understand the American gun fetish you have to understand American business.  The National Rifle Association is a front organization for gun manufacturers.  Their purpose is to convince every American to buy many guns to keep the gun manufacturers happily counting their profits, while providing salaries for NRA staff, and especially its president - their major sales force.  Public safety does not trump profits.  <br/><br/>When you add the American cowboy myth - the strong, silent hero who tamed the West after a gun fight with the bad guy (different story if you are talking to North American indigenous people), you have a combination made in heaven for the gun manufacturers and the NRA infrastructure,and a potential inferno in every movie theater, mall and school in the country.  <br/><br/>Since the Republican political leadership of Kansas seems to live in fantasy land, they are probably too out of it to even understand they have a problem - until someone comes into the state house who perhaps thinks they are not strong enough on abortion, calls them a bunch of baby killers and pulls out a gun.  Good luck to them.  If I were the citizens of that state - I would stay out of my state house until sanity again prevails.   

1075
In criticizing PM Netanyahu, Kristoff brings up the same tired arguments of conveniently finding Israeli "experts" who say the deal is in Israel's, while ignoring those with more experience and information who disagree.<br/><br/>In fact, Ami Ayalon formerly headed the Shin Bet an INTERNAL security agency, and his actual view of the deal is that' it's   “the best plan currently on the table.”  But, “I think the deal is bad. It’s not good,” he stated.<br/><br/>As for Efraim Halevy, he described what he sees as several strong points in the agreement, suggesting that it would be “important to hold a profound debate in Israel on whether no agreement is preferable to an agreement which includes components that are crucial for Israel’s security.”<br/><br/>Halevy does not explicitly state which side of the debate he favors, although he seems to support getting behind the deal. “There will be no other agreement and no other negotiations,” he wrote in the more recent op-ed. He never said that the deal is a “good” one.<br/><br/>Those are hardly endorsing opinions and Mr. Kristoff is disingenuous when he trumpets them as Israelis with far more "security expertise" who "endorse" the deal.<br/><br/>Finally, if Mr. Kristoff is so concerned about what Israeli experts with the most security experience think, he should consider that those most in the know, Israel's defense minister, Gen. Moshe Ya'alon as well as it's former defense minister Gen Ehud Barak (Israel's most decorated soldier) have come out strongly against the deal.

1076
Hey Times, how stupid do you think America is to believe any of this 'reform'?  It is only geared to buy time for Iran to take over Iraq. The Arab culture is built on corruption and dishonesty in government. Nothing will change a culture that is built on fiefs and tribes, to think otherwise is delusional. Thinking anything has changed since the seventy century is the province of fools, like The Times.  Sectarianism trumps democracy.  Get real.

1077
Labor is the single largest expense most firms face. If the assumption that women are just as productive as men but are paid less (a commonly reported figure is 77 cents on every dollar earned by men), in a world where firms compete with one another, any firm that bucks the "good old boy" network you allege to exist by hiring a predominantly female workforce would have a huge, and possibly decisive, cost advantage over firms that don't.<br/><br/>You are no doubt correct that people prefer to hire those people with whom they feel some kind of affinity. The parameters that determine affinity are many and are not restricted to things like gender or ethnicity, though those certainly might be two important ones. The question is whether the affinity motive is so important that it trumps the profit motive. I doubt that it is, especially in the long run. Look, for example, at how many white English-speaking male-owned landscaping companies hire a workforce consisting almost exclusively of cheap Spanish-speaking Mexican and Guatamalan (often undocumented) immigrants. 

1078
Why ISIS trumps hypocrisy is the real issue.  Neither the ISIS caliphate nor the al Qaeda insurgency were born in a vacuum.  <br/><br/>Where is there freedom from ethnic sectarian nation state oppression and terror in the Middle East? Islamists go to Muslim states. Zionists tend towards the Jewish state.<br/><br/>America and it's European allies created and support the Sunni Muslim Arab nation state secular military dictators and theocratic fossil fuel autocrats that foment and nurture ethnic sectarian unrest and extremism.  By denying the divine natural certain unalienable equal rights of their people. America and it's European allies support the Israeli occupation, blockade/siege and exile. But America and it's European allies are opposed to Islamic extremist ethnic sectarian organizations like al Qaeda, ISIS and their followers and affiliates who do likewise.<br/><br/>America and it's European allies marginalize and stigmatize Muslims, particularly Arabs, in their midst.  While engaged in a world wide socioeconomic political educational military crusade against Islam and Muslims.

1079
Why is there not an all out global alliance attacking ISIS? What are the politics involved here (sad as that sounds)? Do the USA, Russia, China and other global powers have divergent interests in destroying ISIS? Who is making money from selling ISIS their weapons? The USA can overthrow governments on trumped up allegations (no pun intended) because the ends justify the means, but here where there is clear evil at work, we and other countries act with caution and over-analysis. Shame on the world's leaders.

1080
Thank you for this column. I've also been puzzled by the knee-jerk responses about "black on black violence," as if this were some kind of trump card that negates all police violence. Of course there are more community killings than police killings since there are (orders of magnitude) many more community members than there are police--about 14 million black Americans compared to 800,000 police officers in the US.<br/><br/>Further, as you point out, police should (obviously) be held to a higher standard. They are our representatives, our protectors, our champions. What does it say when a large segment of our population can't trust the police to keep them safe? Another common strategy is to point out that many of those killed were "behaving badly" by resisting arrest. Is resisting or fleeing arrest now a capital crime? As a white person, I have little fear that if I fled from a police officer he would shoot me in the back. 

1081
This is the most painful reading I ever have done, trumping all the injustice of the unjust horror I've experienced, or read about in hundreds of similar situations that existed (exist) over time in our own nation -- and the beat goes on -- justified by "books of rules" written by males over ages past, and laid down as law and passed on in continuing to guarantee unquestionable gender dominance of the so-called "weaker" sex by guys who said they had been visited by a superhuman "God" and were told that they were to be the scribes for "Himself," because they each were a "he."<br/>Still, in today's "ancient" thinking world, male constructed religions are still being born of male constructors' minds, and because male thinks/constructs  it, it IS.   <br/><br/>As the poet said: "Because you have spoken it has not happened, it's a book you read, a play you saw... "  

1082
Kristof,s first point, that if Congress killed the Iranian nuclear deal that would catastrophically damage American influence, is a sound one.  Sadly, his article goes downhill from there and (like most such pieces) ignores the trumpeting elephant in the room - Israel's own substantial and perfectly illegal cache of ready-to-fire nuclear weapons.

1083
Fundamentalist ideologists are fundamentally dangerous.  This holds true for ISIS, and it holds true for the religious fanatics of all stripes that live right here in the U.S.A.   People need to be taught that respect for one's fellow man trumps all else.  Otherwise, the great evolutionary accident that is humanity will be squandered.

1084
It's not necessary for the President to make any further arguments, the  Huckabibitrump hysteria from the other side makes loud and clear that reason is the more attractive option

1085
This will expose my naïveté with the law, but I never understood the DA's incentive to go hard on all suspects no matter what and trump up the maximum charges. Surely they know some guys are innocent, why push?<br/><br/>Are they afraid of seeming weak on crime, or in the same vein, do more convictions pad their resumes? <br/><br/>Can't they be human and separate the hard crimes from the jaywalking and let some people go back to their normal lives instead of being punitive for the sake of being punitive? Someone weigh in. 

1086
In your 2010 Op-Ed you argue for import taxation as a hard-ball tactic if China doesn't respond to friendlier engagement.  Guess what....Donald Trump called for tariffs on Chinese imports at least as far back as 2011.  Ok so you can claim he copied you, but you can't claim that he was motivated by Xenophobia when he and you basically proposed the same remedy to currency manipulation to juice exports.  Otherwise, you're implicating yourself too. Can't imagine you'd want to.<br/><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-loves-hate-china-257799" title="http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-loves-hate-china-257799" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-loves-hate-china-257799</a> 

1087
In a minority of cases, the real problem was the decision to arrest. This was evident in Mr. Tomlin's arrest on a trumped-up charge and in Adriana's case, where an arrest might have been avoided if the officers had done some investigation.  Even if people can make bail, arrests like this have bigger ramifications, because they often cause people to lose hourly work, jobs, housing, and custody of children.  (Another example of this was Sandra Bland, the woman who committed suicide in jail in Texas.)  This part of the problem needs to be addressed by police departments.<br/><br/>The bigger problem involves the larger category of people whose arrests are easily justified and who are less sympathetic that Mr. Tomlin and Adriana. (The author's decision to use them as prime examples is questionable.)  The inability to make bail of petty criminals is often harmful to society as well as to them, since being held temporarily in jail often ruins any chances of keeping a job or an apartment or maintaining a lifestyle that encourages a productive life.

Mr. Krugman  if you are genuinely interested in the meaning of the power behind the Trump campaign, look no further than <a href="http://draft-back-america.org/some-thoughts-on-the-trump-campaign" title="http://draft-back-america.org/some-thoughts-on-the-trump-campaign" target="_blank">http://draft-back-america.org/some-thoughts-on-the-trump-campaign</a>

Thanks for the put-down, Mr. Kristof.  Accusations that President Obama is appealing to anti-Semitic tropes are ludicrous?  The President may not have intended anti-Semitic utterances, and Mr. Kristof may not recognize the anti-Semitic resonance in references to donors (money) and powerful people working in the background to undermine America, but that only demonstrates that they have tin ears.  <br/><br/>But many Comments in the media demonstrate that the controversy over the Iran deal has encouraged many haters to surface.  *They* have picked up on anti-Semitic tropes.  Many of us see veiled threats in comments by Obama, Kerry, and members of their entourage (e.g., Israel -- Jews? -- will be blamed if the Iran deal falls through).  <br/><br/>President Obama and his acolytes have created an atmosphere in which many view disagreement as un-American ("treason" has also been used).  They have encouraged a.view whereby "loyalty" to The President is supposed to trump reason and individual choice -- as though Barak Obama is our monarch, rather than President of a democratic republic.<br/><br/>Mr. Obama and his team are alienating many who supported him, and are debasing his office.

1090
Interestingly enough, it's this same sort of alienation that leads poorer white voters to vote GOP/TeaParty here in this country. It trumps reason, not to mention linguistic skills. Almost every showy piece of legislation proposed and passed by the GOP Congress has something patriotic in its title, and the title is the very antithesis of what such legislation seeks to take away from the "base" who eagerly hear about it on Fox "News." Simply put, the GOP "base" is too clueless, ignorant, and full of hate to realize they're being gamed for the benefit of the top 1%.<br/>The best explanation for this is an old one offered by Adorno, et al., in "The Authoritarian Personality"--the "f-scale"--based on fascist practices in Europe from 1922-45.<br/>     The personality type Adorno et al. identified can be defined by nine traits that were believed to cluster together as the result of childhood experiences. These traits include conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intellectualism, anti-intraception, superstition and stereotypy, power and "toughness", destructiveness and cynicism, projectivity, and exaggerated concerns over sex. (See Wikipedia entry for "The Authoritarian Personality.")<br/>This applies to both the elected officials who sell out to those who finance their campaign, not to mention those who love to be told what to do and whom to hate. It also explains why the GOP/Tea Party came up with the concept of "religious liberty" promote freedom to hate.

1091
The reality is that the major differences between men and women programmed by nature still exist, despite strident feminist claims to the contrary.  And to most women, children, family and lifestyles still trump careers, while for most men, including the best fathers, much of their very identity (tragically disregarded by feminists) is still tied to their careers. It follows that most men invest more energy and time in their work and take it more seriously than most women and that the set of statistics that “prove” the wage gap is simply not sound.<br/>Traditional male deference to women should not be used to stand logic on its head and conclude that the exceptions make the rule.

You're right, but the sheer lunacy of arresting someone for possessing a plastic straw trumps all of that.  Is he a flight risk?  Might he go out and buy another soda with another straw?  What if he hadn't shown up for court, when they dismissed his case which was based on absolutely nothing?  It's pretty hard to take those concerns seriously given the staggering corruption of the NYPD.

1093
Sickening!  Reading this, I couldn't help but think of other examples in which men have used religion to justify controlling women.  Unfortunately, many of these examples are  recent.  I used to cynically reject, as quaint and parochial, the oft trumpeted, very 20th century claim that we humans were marching along some linear trajectory of progress and modernity. But, seeing this type of resurgence of what can only be described as the most base, animalistic behavior, I have to believe that enlightened humans who reject violence, slavery, inequality and injustice of all kind, have in fact progressed further in some evolutionary way

1094
The punishments are considered to be rational and necessary tools of control.<br/><br/>There is virtually no right wing regime in the world that does not advocate one form of corporal punishment or another in order to maintain control over "others" that don't think like them.     ISIS just happens to represent the "trumps" in their particular culture (that is, a culture that stops moving left a full 90 degrees short of centrist).<br/><br/>An, Oh, by the way, virtually every socialist movement in the world was hijacked by 'right wingers' early on in it's history leaving no authentic examples (outside of Scandinavia).

He says what's on his mind without worrying about the consequences; including publicly rating women on their physical appearance on a scale of 1-10.<br/>He is not "politically correct" in any sense, and I admire that. I feel that the general public is too sensitive. It's hard to state an honest opinion without someone, somewhere, getting offended. The only thing I did not agree with is calling all Mexicans criminals. I'm sure he meant that there are currently a lot of illegal aliens entering this country with a horrid record, however it is ignorant to blame all Mexican-Americans.<br/>Trump "rating" women, and his other offensive opinions, should not affect his campaign. The majority of this country did not care when Bill Clinton cheated on his wife on multiple occasions. Their reason? "His personal life choices have nothing to do with how he leads/is leading this country." I completely disagree. Having a clear set of morals is VERY important when leading a nation. However, my point if no one cared about Clinton cheating, why is Trump's brutal honesty and audacity so repulsive? Do we not want an honest president?<br/>I'm not sure if Trump is fit for presidency, but he's getting bashed on for simply being honest about who he is and what he REALLY thinks. And I'd take that over sugar coated lies with a hint of "charm" any day.

An excellent explanation of the inadequacy of the common explanations of the appeal and rise of ISIS is in the August 13 issue of the New York Review of Books. It makes no pretense of coming up with an adequate explanation.<br/><br/>Let me proffer one.<br/>ISIS offers something which is rarely discussed let alone offered in most of the world currently: a vision. By the standards of the vast majority of people it is a tormented vision from hell, but at least it is a vision. Such is largely lacking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Western Europe no longer supplies a progressive, liberal, humanist vision which, even if slowly and through imperialism, spread around the world.<br/><br/>America's vision reached its apogee with the democratization and reconstruction of Germany and Japan after World War II followed by the landing on the moon. Since then it has treaded water, a very brief, ephemeral revival produced by the election of a Black President, an event which turned out to be more circumstantial than significant.<br/><br/>China clearly projects a vision, but it is only for the Chinese.<br/><br/>What all this leaves is a vacuum of spirit, a vacuum of grand purpose, a vacuum of transcendence. And electronic consumer culture, the only current offering of the West, just cannot fill this void. ISIS does fill this void. And lest we are tempted to pooh pooh the attractions of Hell, let us remember that what people largely read and most certainly remember is Dante's Inferno, not his Paradiso.<br/><br/>ISIS may be hell, but hell trumps a void. 

1097
Until about 50 years ago, if you had sex, you got pregnant. That's how human biology (and all mammalian biology) WORKS.<br/><br/>If you were single and got pregnant, you threw the obligation for the expenses of your child (plus your inability to work, perhaps gathering berries, while pregnant) on the community and your family. In virtually all cases, the man got off scot-free, because there was no way to prove paternity (until about 30 years ago).<br/><br/>If you got married on the other hand, the sex still resulted in pregnancy, but your HUSBAND was compelled to support you and the child, and to acknowledge paternity. As a positive by-product of this, it got men to actually parent their own children, and pass down their skills and property to their children (assuming they owned anything).<br/><br/>Our society today is a pretty good example of what happens when that basic sensible set up goes haywire -- 72% of children born out of wedlock, most growing up fatherless, men who are absolutely detached from their biological children -- children being raised in chaos.<br/><br/>Of course, lefty liberals think this is all MARVELOUS, since to them sexual freedom trumps every other possible need or obligation.

1098
This is one of the most horrifying news stories I've ever read. I'm very opposed to the use of military force, but I can't see any other solution where ISIS is concerned. When I read this, I couldn't help thinking about this prediction by Nostradamus, ""Out of the country of Greater Arabia Shall be born a strong master of Mohammed...He will enter Europe wearing a blue turban. He will be the terror of mankind. Never more horror." What I just read is indeed horror and allied forces should make every effort to put a stop to it, not only for the sake of the Middle East, but for the safety of the entire world. Hate to sound like I'm blowing the trumpet of doom and gloom, but hey.

1099

The seventeen advocates of the Islamic State are letting the loudest member to 'trumpet' the message.    The rest are lying in wait for the opportunity to take over the movement and invest it with their particular version of [punitive] family values.

I think Trump is having a good time being trump and he doeesnt care about fact or reality. He is on stage and making fools out of the Republican party.  Bottom line..Keep it up Trump

At first I said to myself: Vitamins! Is this some kind of a joke? This  country has been exporting terror throughout the world for years and giving Hamas and Hezbollah thousands of rockets and mortars to shoot at Israel. And the Times gives some guy space to complain about vitamins? Have these people lost their minds?<br/><br/>But then I said to myself: But if ordinary Iranians have suffered so much under the sanctions, why are we stopping now instead of doubling or tripling them? The sanctions were<br/>never supposed to be a kid's game. They were put into place to force Iran to stop building nuclear weapons by making the country hurt. You say they haven't worked yet and people are suffering ? So what? Atom bombs trump vitamins every day of the week. We should have kept the sanctions on and still should.

1104
It's edifying to see a Wall Street insider take down the supposedly great business leader - the self trumpeter exposed for his lack of monetary, financial or jobs- creating economic acumen that keeps slipping through the cracks of his bluster. 

1105
We certainly have our challenges cut out for us -- and not just water.  <br/><br/>But every day as I read the Times, I'm grateful this state has an educated liberal majority.  No defunding of women's clinics, no denying gays marriage licenses, and the Bible doesn't trump science.  Our current lieutenant governor, Gavin Newsom, is a strong proponent of alternative energy, and was first in the country to challenge the ban on gay marriage, as mayor of San Francisco.<br/><br/>California will continue to innovate!

Shear because it caught my interest when I saw it on my Twitter feed. this article is talking about the highlights in the analysis of the Republican debate and is specially caught my eye because it was talking about Donald trumps controversial opinion on Mexican immigrants and especially connects to my life because being a girl with a Latino background I know a lot of people because the Kind of parents that I have that have come to the United States as immigrants and it brought a personal connection to the story that I was reading about Donald Trump's speech. I know that after this he said he may there was a lot of debating and arguing from the Mexican community and in this article it said that in the Republican debate he once again brought up the point. Donald once again said in his speech that he thinks Mexico is sending immigrants into the United States and called them "the bad ones" and thinks that the only reason why American leaders are taking them is because they're "stupid". Normally I wouldn't be interested in politics but the topic of Donald Trump running for president particularly interests me. I personally take offense to what he keeps saying in his speeches because my parents came into this country as immigrants but work just as hard as anyone else that lived here.

The rest of the world is occupied with trying to govern, vision nowhere on the agenda.<br/><br/>What this leaves is a vacuum of spirit, of purpose, of transcendent vision. An electronic consumer culture, the only current offering of the West, cannot fill the void. ISIS, on the other hand, does fill this void, providing meaning, purpose, and a sense of belonging greater than the confines of individual existence. Lest we are tempted to pooh pooh the attractions of Hell as something peculiar to another culture, remember that people largely read Dante's Inferno, not his Paradiso.<br/><br/>ISIS may be hell, but hell trumps a void, at least for enough people to produce an ascending ISIS. 

1108
That's largely true, but the thing about naturally occurring sugar is that it usually occurs with something else.  Orange juice is basically sugar water, sure, but an orange has fiber and other nutrients in it.  That's not to say that you can just eat oranges because they're "healthy," but it is to say that an orange is going to be better for you, on balance, than a candybar with an equivalent amount of sugar.<br/><br/>It's also important to remember that sugar is just a carbohydrate.  You don't need to banish it--or other carbs--from your diet, you just need to balance your intake with other macronutrients.  For most people in America, and apparently Australia and probably a lot of other developed countries, a move towards a balanced macronutrient breakdown is going to mean cutting a lot of carbs, but that doesn't mean that carbs in and of themselves are a bad source of calories.  If you're running a lot, or doing any other kind of extended physical activity, carbs are a great source of energy.  There's also some reason to believe that carbs help metabolize protein following extreme exertion.<br/><br/>People need to understand what moderation means in the context of nutrition.  There is no one thing that trumps any other thing.

1109
Sorry. I should think that the overall health of a player trumps a red card any day. And then, there's the sheer lack of professionalism in Mourinho's postgame comments to the media.  Not good.

1110
It takes so many forms--a "promise" to not raise taxes for constituents (and campaign supporters)  trumps a "contract" for workers' pensions.  The Brooklyn Nets arena was only built because eminent domain was cited to remove the homes of private citizens.  But of course--it's only "eminent domain" because taxpayers foot the bill, otherwise it's a purely private venture with ticket prices beyond what most middle-class families can afford and players--hundreds and thousands of them in every sport becoming millionaires--owners--billionaires.  Why aren't the funds paid back when the profits are reaped?  why can't taxes be raised to meet contractual obligations with municipal workers, but they can be to raise to help private entrepreneurs and athletes profit--not to mention all the contractors along the way...  Is there no backbone anywhere?

Another harangue about what women should do with their own bodies, Mr. Douthat? Another play for "My beliefs and values trump yours"? Another display of utter disregard for the physical, emotional, and financial burdens "your" choice would have on their lives, their jobs, their entire futures? Another sexalted attempt to manhandle their rights without offering to pay whatever they demand for submitting to your will, just because you choose to believe your conscience is more moral than theirs?<br/><br/>Need I remind you that consciences leash the hounds, not the neighbors?<br/><br/>Isn't it time you started respecting their personal, legal, and, yes, moral choices, and instead practiced holding only yourself to your own chosen beliefs, and subjecting only yourself to your own chosen religion's demands?

"Mr. Harper represents the politics of willful ignorance. It has its attractions."<br/><br/>A telling commentary on the apathy of the Canadian people and the limits of first-past the post electoral processes. Save us from the end of Canada if he wins the next election. Harper has bee dismantlng democracy and every institution put in place over fifty years of Canadian social programs. In spite of plummeting crime rates, his "law &amp; order" mythology trumped logic. His racist policies re: immigration, citizenship, etc. have created communities of the disenfranchised. His paranoia and love for security and surveillance leaves us all at risk. His weird love for militaristic display and the self-fashioning of Canadian history in the teen boy captivated by war. His foreign policy makes war more material and makes strange bedfellows of Netanyahu: we just bought Iron Dome missiles test-driven on the children massacred in Gaza last summer. His ultra right Rapture-style Xian faith and followers are leading us into some ideological dessert. Indeed: "Whether or not he loses, he will leave Canada more ignorant than he found it. The real question for the coming election is a simple but grand one: Do Canadians like their country like that?"

1114
Consistent with his right wing ideology I believe Harper will create an incident that will attempt to manipulate enough gullible Canadians to perhaps swing the election his way.  He will follow in the footsteps of his friend John Howard the former PM of Australia who was headed toward defeat when days before the election he claimed that a boatload of immigrants had thrown their children overboard in order to seek asylum in Australia.  Playing on voters fear and disgust he won the election.  A Senate inquiry later determined that Howard/ Conservatives knew from the get go that the allegations were false.   Or as Kim Arlington stated the Conservatives had manufactured “the most despicable of lies.”  Given Harper’s (and his colleagues – Pierre Poilievre et al.) dishonest orientation to politics you can count on something similar happening.  Perhaps for example, a trumped up altercation with Russia, a falsely proclaimed “terrorist” event, or doctored statistics making absurd claims contrary to reality about the health of the economy or the environment, anything that will help him win.  You have to know that Harper/Conservatives have no moral boundaries nor do they have any respect for democracy. Btw when John Howard was PM, Jeffery Simpson of the Globe and Mail wrote “he offered Mr. Harper political advice. More important, Mr. Harper’s team studied carefully the strategy and tactics of Mr. Howard’s party.”

1115
Mr. Marche's opinions are similar to those held by most of the Canadian journalistic community, where Harper's faults - and there are some very real ones - are continually trumpeted and amplified, while those of the other parties are essentially ignored. To attempt to link Harper to the Fords of Toronto municipal politics is simply absurd, and the Senate expense "scandal" is in reality a case of an badly flawed institution where rules about spending simply didn't exist, and a number of Senators were guilty of the same things, regardless of political stripe. I believe Harper has adopted the attitude he has in part because he knows the press will crucify him no matter what he does, so why even bother with the charade. Meanwhile the other major parties consist of the NDP, a far-left group that are promising universal free child care on the taxpayer's tab along with handing the reins of power to big labour, if their track records in provincial governments here are any guide. Meanwhile the Liberals are hoping voters have now forgotten their last time in power, where a sponsorship scandal involving many millions in illegal spending revealed the cronyism that they have been traditionally known for. Canada is significantly more left-wing than the USA and even Harper would probably be considered a moderate Democrat in the USA based upon his policies.  Our choices are him, a far-left NDP, or a Liberal party that in many way combines the worst of both the Conservatives and NDP. 

1116
Congratulations on the series, Ms. Belkin; it certainly looks worthy of your excellent and important book. It's of course often rather difficult for those who have not been injured by decades-long, government-supported housing segregation to know how damaging it is and the poverty cycle it perpetuates for those so injured by it. The Yonkers example, while very painful for nearly all involved, is instructive, as you state. <br/><br/>Desegregating housing areas did not lead to increased crime; it did not lead to the falling or collapse of property values. And it is pernicious for desegregation opponents to assert otherwise, playing on the very real fear that so many homeowners possess about the risks associated with changes to the neighborhood. Astorino's demagoguery on the issue is designed to begin the familiar chain-reaction. People will persuade themselves that they are not really racist or classist, but, well, that prospective area home buyers might be, which might lead to a decline in home values when people stop buying in the area after a notable change in the neighborhood, which might lead to faltering family finances. All these "mights" compel them to act. So then they fight and organize, determined to keep things the way they are because that suits them nicely. They're at best only dimly aware of the people on the other side and at worst determined to keep them as far away as possible. Their fear of the unknown trumps rational thinking (these people are really just like us).

Microsoft across the lake has its own (numerous) set of problems, but work-life balance is not one of them.<br/><br/>Sick? Caring for a family member? Kids need something? Got to leave at 4 or 5? Starting the weekend early?<br/><br/>No problem. No questions asked.<br/><br/>This reduces resentment and helps employees give their best when they're at work. Sleep-deprived employees think they're contributing when really their altered state of mind blinds them to their mistakes.<br/><br/>Amazon's trove of data does not trump this age-old wisdom.

As one commenter has already noted, our society more and more lacks a compelling vision for young people.  Our current "vision" best follows Trump, sports stars, and Wall Street: be loud, rich, and powerful.  The charade is that it trumps everything.  Although Christianity has a social message that is as compelling as Islam, the Christian right focus on judgement, individual morality, gays and abortion and this lacks a life compelling vision.  For a while, the prosperity vision "worked" until the corporate world abandoned it.  Given the lack of moral leadership in this country, I would expect this to get worse before it gets better.

1119
This is what happens when you go to work for an awkward, socially inept and singularly focused organizational leader. The company market's itself with a "cool factor" sheen to prospective employees but under the covers it's an awful place to work.  These highly capable employees are selling detergent and cheap books, not curing cancer and deserving of so much more. Yet they are treated like cattle and the message is "you are expendable" instead of "we are glad to have you". This has been an increasingly common theme in the technology world where talented young people mortgage their lives spending 80+ hours a week as a cog in a larger machine designed to enrich the ego and pocketbook of a selfish, immature and maniacal leader. High turnover is indicative of a troubled work culture where leadership and development in the management ranks is lacking. Take it from a 30 year veteran of the professional ranks at all levels, workplace culture trumps stock options every time.

As an American when I look out over the world I often wonder why me? Why was I born into a great democracy? Why did I hit the lotto that is America? <br/><br/>I feel guilty for my wealth knowing so many have so little. But in that guilt there is great solace knowing that throughout history the humanity of an individual trumps religion. <br/><br/>Although lucky to be born into America I am infinetly more lucky to have parents that taught me in the context of religion, the value of humanity and grace. Within that humanity and grace it is easy to feel disgust for the perpetrators of this religion and to feel the pain of the women they victimize. <br/><br/>America has certainly had its share of barbaric acts upon women and minorities, However deep our problems and our inability to totally purge ourselves of racisim and brutality toward others, america tuly serves as a beacon of hope for so many in this world.

The NY Times used to be a great newspaper but I believe it has lost its way.  Where it used to lead with incisive reporting, held wide scope, and strove for objectivity, now it wastes its prestige trumpeting causes like marijuana laws and packs its pages with weak analyses and commentaries designed to provoke reader sympathy or outrage on its favored issues.  It has become a mirror image of its Fox News and Murdoch rivals.  This has nothing to do per se with the migration from print to on-line format, but rather with the decision to adopt commercial and popular on-line standards, where maximizing site visits and click count are actively sought and standards lowered to accommodate them.  Do the editors pick their causes to maximize click counts?  It is important to note that on-line doesn't have to be this way: Most established academic journals have transitioned to on-line without compromising their standards. The NY Times could have been a leader in showing how a reputable newspaper could remain so in the on-line world, but it elected to be a follower instead.  The result is a NY Times website that is bloated with ads and presents viewers with agonizingly long times waiting for adware site contacts to be completed before they can see the few stories that are still worth reading.

I'm shocked at the banality of the column but like the previous one on Ttump Ms Dowd seems to have been trumped. While more worthy  politicians are dodging her line of fire she seems uncharacteristically to be breathing fresh air into the blasphemous lungs of Trump?

Jules - The Bible may not trump science in California, but New Age nonsense and upper-middle-class privilege sure as heck do. That same "liberal majority" you refer to is the epicenter of the anti-vax trend, who place their "gut feeling", their 4 hours on Google, and their BA in Communications above 40 years of scientific consensus and biomedical expertise.

Despite his warts, Mr. Harper's efforts have restrained the liberalism-gone-wild politically correct movements that trumpet their questionable fact-based pronouncements which are usually nothing more than faddish concoctions. The great progressive rise in American politics during the Pelosi, Reid, Obama triumvirate has poisoned the well of economic well being and led to increased volatility in the World's trouble spots that may well boil over into a worldwide conflagration.<br/>Hunker down with Harper Canada. We will need a sensible ally as we purge the painful Progressive poison sold to us with great elocution and grand assurances that the most knowledgeable and nouveau policies would deliver us to the promised land. What a bunch of bunk!

Yes, it is wrong that Trump used such harsh and offensive words, but clearly Trump is taking a bold path in his presidential campaign. Taking this path, he should be well aware that the tone and words he has chosen, could and most likely will be used against him in the future. However, Ms. Kelly wasn't innocent in the interview. She said that she was just "doing her job as a journalist", yet after watching the full interview it is clear that Ms. Kelly was not separating her personal opinion from her job. She is known for attacking politicians and being harsh during interviews, and even some would say that she is known for making it more about her rather than the person she is interviewing. It is no surprise that Trump wouldn't respond positively to her

One could easily see my love for Disney trumps my love for Universal. To compete against a company as big as Disney is, it is no doubt that Universal will have to further expand and make new additions to keep up. I guess after years they have put into making new additions like Harry Potter World and Despicable Me rides, Universal’s hard work has payed off. Because of the falling economy, theme parks like such are a very risky business to invest in. Companies like Comcast,which is now big investors in Universal, have to fully invest themselves first to see a bigger outcome. Since this calls for more attraction, theme parks lovers like me are very pleased for the new rides to come. Not only are new attractions being made in Universal but also in DIsney world. This creates a whole new level of excitement for people to come check out the new parks and bring more business to both parks. Universal relies on its business brought into from the theme parks more than its movies produced so it is crucial the parks do even better than its competitor down the street, Disney World. As the huge attractions compete against each other for business, imagine the possibilities of new rides and additions to come.

Our water sources are defiled by agricultural runoff. The seas are rising around us as the governor and legislators deny science. Florida education, a national joke, is a disgrace made worse by sanctioned privatization (charters) that sucks off the public resources. Development, the mother of corruption, has transformed sunswept charm into urban ugliness. Politics of hate trump every other discussion.  Let's be honest, it's Mississippi with better beaches.

Mr. Blow tells us that the #BLM movement trumps everyone else's ability to peacefully attend a political rally where we may become an informed electorate.  When the attendees were done with complying with the activists' demands, the former then asked that Mr. Sanders be allowed to speak.  The crowd was then called racist.  Why is it acceptable for one group to oppress another indeed?  The activists were bullies, and slapping a label of racism on anyone who opposes their tactics is itself racist, ugly and intellectually dishonest.

ISIS offers something which is rarely discussed let alone offered in most of the world today: a vision. By common standards, it is a vision from hell, but at least it is a vision.

Why in the world should BLM disruptions trump ( yes, pun intended ) my right to hear what Sanders has to say? If BLM wants a respectful hearing then let them respect the rights of others. How about this as an acronym: ALM/APDR ... All Lives Matter/ All People Deserve Respect.

1137
I don't know what planet you have been living on but my experience of the art world and live models for class is hardly respectful starting with pay.  There's also a humiliation of the flesh and unacknowledged objectification in the name of some higher plane that is somehow more raw and cutting than in the fashion world, where I've also worked, that is at least honest about its commercial interests.  The duplicity of fine art toward models could take a page from fashion.<br/><br/>About good models and submission, more often that not, the show is more about grooming young people into the workplace and having to master lessons any employee must have is at the root of what is encouraged on the show, albeit trumped up into TV drama, liking a spider, wearing something one does not like. etc.  What I like about this is that it shows the need to take risk by a group of young people who have been socialized into thinking risk is posting self porn to the internet.  No, the "submission" Tyra asks of her contestants are about facing themselves head on and finding out just who one is.  There should be more not less of this kind of risk and not by young people today.

We live suspended somewhere inbetween the reality and the nebulous world of  our ideas, which are supposedly meant to make the real world better although the evidence is mixed at best.  World peace and Nuclear bombs, Hunger and Gluttony , Vegans and Animal rights all point to contradictions  of modern living. <br/><br/>The ideas of vegan living only arise when there is abundance of food. Note that in poverty stricken regions there is no such moral dilemma . It seems that reality trumps all ideas except when it is softened a blurry haze by prosperity. <br/><br/>I find it fascinating that some of us take these hard moral positions, and perhaps some of us must- for what good are our abilities to generate ideas if they don't attempt to change our conceptions provided we don't fall completely in the  trap of any one singular hardcore ideology. <br/><br/>I do think we have become more and more cruel towards animals. Our resturant businesses, eating choices thrive and drive the increasingly toxic innovations of food industry. Modern living is shortsighted. And obviously the universe has no grand scheme to incorporate kindness in the phenomenon of existence called life.<br/><br/>The show always goes on when it is question of Money.

How bad is this deal?  Apparently, Trump is right that Iran gets $100-150 billion even if the Iran deal is rejected.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-gets-keep-150-billion-even-if-us/" title="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-gets-keep-150-billion-even-if-us/" target="_blank">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-tr...</a>

1140
   The Iran deal is, indeed, the best we can have, diplomacy trumping war anytime, provided we can verify that the agreement is followed; take the deal away, and everybody will repent losing the chance to make sure nothing 'out of the ordinary' occurs. What is most galling is the fact that the republicans have condemned the deal even before knowing its content and value, making them hypocrites at best, spiteful at worst (towards Obama), a shameful willful ignorance, tremendously dangerous to all of us, Israel included. Where did our decency go? And if no decency, common sense? And if no common sense, reality and truth?

1141
Well, you know how the electorate is.<br/><br/>Republicans get a pass for lying the nation into a trumped-up, for-profit war, and for singlehandedly imploding the US economy, while Clinton, acting in accordance with law and procedure, puts e-mail on a private server and is cast as a criminal who should be tarred and feathered and put behind bars.<br/><br/>The lesson?  Right wing propaganda works.  Conquer it and the nation progresses.

1142
As usual, for Krugman politics trumps economics.<br/><br/>He wonders why GOP Presidential candidates would risk alienating voters by trying to fix social security. <br/><br/>Maybe it is because they have still have some principles and refuse to compete with the Democrats in seeing who can pay the biggest bribes to voters. <br/><br/>Sounds like a good reason for voting GOP -- if you have any principles left. 

1143
There is so much to parse in this discussion:<br/><br/>1. Given their history in such matters, Jews everywhere have a legitimate right to doubt this deal with Iran. As humans our emotions trump all reason, until we find a way to read those emotions and understand what they are really "telling us".<br/><br/>In this case, supporters of the deal have to ask their Jewish doubters what sort of deal they would accept. Is there ANY deal that would not give them that sick feeling? It will not win everyone over, but it will give something to reflect rationally.<br/><br/>2. Jews who are in favor of the deal, like everyone else, are counting on the younger generation of Iranians to make their country more democratic, less theocratic, and more tolerant. That is a big if, but given trends in the last 25 years (ISIS notwithstanding) there is cause for cautious optimism on that front.<br/><br/>3. Mr. Netanyahu seems to be working very hard to isolate Israel from her allies. He has forced doubts on Jewish commitment to true Democracy at a time when the West is trying to impress the benefits of Democracy to his neighbors. With settlements, occupation, and overt racist campaign tactics, he is making Israel's brave experiment with liberal democracy endangered. The American Right has weird fantasies of Armageddon, but what are Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters trying to achieve?<br/><br/>This deal buys time, and legal credibility. If we must indeed bomb Iran, it will be with cause and not trumped up charges. 

1144
Good advice. I would add that potentially an even better methodology to draw conclusions from is a meta-analysis of multiple studies. Often there are dozens of studies of a particular question and a meta-analysis is essentially the average result of all of those studies (weighted by sample sizes). It will still have the same limitations as whatever randomized controlled trials and/or observational studies go into the analysis, but generally it will include a range of populations and work from different research teams. It also has the benefit of greatly increasing the sample size (and thus the precision in estimating any effects). Though meta-analyses can be done poorly, generally speaking a meta-analysis trumps the results of any single study as far as strength of evidence goes.

1145
As in so many other decisions about administrative and constitutional law, as well as higher education: big money, fat cat donors, and corporate interests trump individuals' interests and rights.<br/>Anyone who believes that revenue-sport athletes at Division 1 colleges and universities are there primarily "to get an education" has a finely-developed capacity for self-deception.

1146
I'm not sure any analysis would ever be able to explain why young, well-educated people become radicalized. Education isn't foolproof against radicalization if this is what you imply. The human mind is a complex entity where emotions more often than not trump rationalism.This is true more so for a teenager at the peak of hormonal-driven emotion swings. What I believe we can do as a society is to remove the incentives for empathy with ISIS by refusing to join in the demonization of any and every Muslim, accepting that majority in the mulsim world are equal partners in the war against terrorism and also admitting that the west has been complicit, in some ways, of the decent into chaos that has occurred in the ME.

1147
Actually, some of us have identified the right-wing racist and authoritarian forces driving the Trump campaign. <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/31788-trumping-america" title="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/31788-trumping-america" target="_blank">http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/31788-trumping-america</a>

Iran acquiring nuclear capability is not an existential threat to Israel.  It is rather, a rejiggering of the balance of power in the Middle East, a change unfavorable to Israel which Netanyahu hates because Israel then would then have to think twice before they treat the Palestinians like dirt under their feet.<br/><br/>And that is also why Netanyahu is pulling out all the stops in scaring American Jews into lobbying enough Democratic senators to vote against the deal.  He knows this is the last chance for him, if he can't stop it here, he will not launch a unilateral raid on Iran's facilities because absent the bogus trumped up existential threat, a slight recalibration of the balance of power isn't worth  total war with Iran.  <br/><br/>Despite Bibi's doomsday rhetoric, one day after the agreement goes into effect, Israel remains the overwhelming nuclear and military power in the Middle East.  But maybe, instead of treating the Palestinians like grasshoppers, they'll behave just a wee bit better.

1149
it's very sad that netanyahu's personal peevishness vis-a-vis  president obama is part of this drama. no deal that involves russia, china, the u.s., iran, france and england can possibly satisfy an israel led by its right-wing. the same can be said for the u.s.: the american right-wing will oppose an agreement. and that is the ultimate point. opposition to the deal comes from the right-wing - in israel, in the u.s. and in iran. some don't like that juxtaposition and have tried called out the president for pointing it out and for stating that the right has no alternative plan but, ultimately, war (yes, listen to those statesmen, lindsey graham and donald trump). well if the shoe fits...

Douthat's advocacy of defunding Planned Parenthood (answer to question 2) trumps his later comments suggesting some weak support for government programs to provide health services for pregnant women.  His clear hostility to the ACA and its contraceptive provisions also betray a dislike of a public or public-supported safety net for women.  For a man who grounds his opinions in strong moral principles, this ideological rigidity (masquerading as a willingness to compromise) seems discordant.  

1151
The comments/responses to Douthat's latest defense of the indefensible "pro-life" movement are elegant and cogent reminders of the need for a constant vigilance against the forces (like Douthat) who threaten our citizens' civil liberties. <br/><br/>Those who are born...and their needs, considerations, and judgements... "trump" the unborn...however "cute" the pictures of them floating in their amniotic sacs.

1152
Anthony, the rights of the unborn trump the women or the couples decision. Their decision should be to keep and raise the baby or to give the baby up for adoption. The most vulnerable among us is the unborn baby. 

1153
Of all the responses I've ever read, yours is by far the most delusional. Psalm 139:13: "You knit me together in my mother's womb." God very clearly gives all humanity dignity even while they are still in the womb, and you are very dangerously misrepresenting him when you say that Jesus would be pro-choice. Calling yourself a pro-life Christian and cloaking your murderous words in fluent Christian-ese makes you nothing of what you claim to be, only at best very misguided and at worst a heretic.  Yes, protection of our women is important; yes, providing born children with loving homes is important, but you make a grave moral blunder when you elevate those issues at the expense of basic human life. The right to live trumps the right to not be pregnant, period. Finally, regarding your statement, "anti-choice folks, motivated by sinful greed selfishness, cause countless deaths around the world," I'm, well, flabbergasted. Planned Parenthood has earned a net worth of over a billion dollars from their abortion industry, but yet you say it's the "anti-choice" people who are greedy. Pray, tell me, what gain do pro-life people get from preventing abortion? Also, in numbers, tell me how many deaths the pro-life people have caused? Do you think it's more or less than the approximate 57 million babies aborted in the U.S. since 1973? 

1154
Abortion is not morally complicated. Morally, the right to not be killed trumps the right to not be pregnant, period. And I'm sure PP has improved women's access to birth control and condoms, but why is that the end-goal? Shouldn't the goal be better, healthier societies? Because statistically speaking, the rate of single motherhood has tripled since birth control and abortion became available. Why aren't pro-choice people worried about that? 

1155
I live in Seattle and, though I've heard stories, none were as alarming as those reported here. It's truly disturbing. But what I feel this article glossed over, perhaps because it's out of the immediate scope, is the toll Amazon's unprecedented growth is taking on Seattle. I'd love to see a follow up piece "diving deeper," as it were.<br/><br/>The fact is, that at its current pace, Seattle's infrastructure can't handle Amazon. Traffic is atrocious - particularly in the South Lake Union neighborhood where all the blue badges congregate - and, unlike Microsoft or Google's buses, Amazon has done zero to alleviate (or even address) the drain on public transportation. <br/><br/>Housing is increasingly unaffordable due to rampant demand - the 860 sq. ft. house behind mine 10 mins north of SLU just sold for $400K. There are cranes on damned-near every block in the downtown/SLU corridor erecting overpriced apts. <br/><br/>A leader in arts, music, and LGBTQ, the cultural shift we're experiencing as entitled, moneyed, transitory "brogrammers" descend here - disinterested and uninvested in keeping this region special - is heartbreaking. Hate crimes are up. The dating scene is laughable. Small businesses are feeling the pinch.<br/><br/>And all this in the name of RETAIL. When Amazon trumpets about "innovating," they're talking about how to get you to buy more stuff. Next time you think about the convenience, please realize you're supporting a company that is both a steamroller and a bully - and ask if it's worth it.

The book entitled:  It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism Hardcover – May 1, 2012<br/>by Thomas E. Mann  (Author), Norman J. Ornstein (Author) will shed a million points of light on American politics.<br/><br/>It really is a mysterious shame that not even Ronald Reagan would be ashamed of his party in this day of "trumped up" politics.

1157
The changing climate trumps all other issues. If the biosphere changes as much as it looks like it will, all of the other issues that people are mentioning will be moot - we will be working on equality and fairness among corpses and starving refugees.

Reading this article makes me sick like most of the readers here and all the while i kept thinking to myself, am i also just jumping on a 'hate this kind of work culture" bandwagon or am I missing something here. Nope ..i dont think so. This the the modern day equivalent of slaves and or low wage workers (ex: Chinese workers) back in the day working on various developmental projects such as rail roads etc. Some of the conditions might have changed but some of the reasons are pretty much the same , high debts, providing for their loved ones and others who derive their self worth from working at a place like this, which in some perverse way takes pride in being the way it is. Among the many promises of technological revolution, one was the reduction in the number of working hours of the worker. Amazon which works or claims to work on the forefront of cutting edge technology doesn't seem to see the irony in this or may be shareholder wealth maximization trumps all.<br/>This i think in a way captures the inefficiency of the game theory nash equilibrium involving the company and the employees wherein the benefit each 'productive' amazon employee creates is not coming to them. Data may not lie but humans often do.<br/>Anyways none of these discussions really matter as long as amazon/others like it have the supply &amp; demand of skilled labor skewed in its favor because for every Jane being shown the exit door (voluntarily or otherwise), there is another Doe waiting to take her place.

During the struggle to grant full rights to gays in the military, all I could think was: you're just legitimizing the military by doing that. What we really want is no one in the military. Right?<br/><br/>Well, those were my Berkeley pacifist tendencies acting up. Of course it's better to allow gays into the military. <br/><br/>I bring this up because I think it serves as a better analogy to the subject of this piece than the opera scenario. We may wish for a world without war, but if we're going to have war, we should let everyone who wants to participate in it do so.<br/><br/>Maybe it'd be a better world without the exploitation of animals, but like a world without war, we're a long way from getting there. In the meantime let's continue to incrementally civilize the barbaric acts we deem necessary for survival. It can be effective.<br/><br/>Take smoking, for instance. Smoking rates are way down because as a society we decided that the rights of the smoke-averse trumped the rights of the smokers. If anti-smoking zealots tried to hold out for nothing less than a total ban on all smoking in public then we wouldn't have come as far as we have.<br/><br/>That being said, I do question how much of a crisis this actually is. Militant vegans may not be helping to promote things like grass-fed beef or cage-free eggs or antibiotic-free chicken, but they're not really hurting those things either. Most people aren't vegan, and most vegans aren't that extreme.<br/><br/>We've got worse people to worry about.

Amazon's treatment of its employees is just the tip of the corporate iceburg of the mental torture that millions of young Americans must endure. Most of them don't even care. That is how bad it has become.<br/><br/>I knew about waterboarding long before the public did, and it is nothing compared to the mental torture the corporations are putting out these days.<br/><br/>We have a country full of people who are so brainwashed by their employers that they can't utter a peep in protest. It is truly sad, and it makes me disgusted.<br/><br/>The USA lives in its own news bubble, far removed from the views of the rest of the world. Some are getting wiser, but not many of us - especially the politicians and pundits. We are absolutely the laughing stock of the rest of the world (when they are not scratching their heads in amazement at our stupidity and collective narcissism), with all the "trumped up news, declaring nothing." <br/><br/>No wonder Trump is winning. "I'll whine till I win". Yea. At least until we get our phony exceptionalism back into the brainwashing potions mixed by the corporate brewmeisters. Pardon me, but it sucks.

1161
trump is so far from reality. I am surprised to see such candidates for 2016 election. He has no leadership quality and certainly does not has grace of a president candidate. 

1162
If we were all to become vegans tomorrow, animals will still die, whether from natural causes or most likely, by predators. It seems that the main concern from vegans is that we're killing animals. My main concern as an omnivore, is that animals live a dignified life, a life without cruelty or pain inflicted by humans. For this reason, I eat less meat and what I do consume is carefully researched as to assure it was raised in a humane manner. We all die, but no one is insisting that humans should not ever die. We realize that quality of life trumps the idea of immortality. Have you seen a fox kill a chicken? It's not pretty, but we accept this as the natural course of things.<br/><br/>I wish we lived in a world where livestock and other animals suffered no abuse and my choices reflect this. But do I think it is inherently immoral to slaughter an animal for food? No, I don't. And I wish my vegan friends would stop speaking as if they own the moral high road and realize that you can't impose your values on others. Let's work on improving the lives of all animals and educating people on how to make better choices.

1163
Fine.  You know what?  Fine.<br/><br/>Maybe it will take several states breaking out into a rash of STDs, more pregnancy complications through lack of prenatal care, more unplanned pregnancies, more women harmed by self-induced abortion attempts, and more strains on services to the poor due to increased need, just to get people to stop and freaking think for a change.  <br/><br/>I would rather err on the side of caution and not conduct this experiment, because no personal ideology should ever trump reality and endanger someone else's life.  <br/><br/>But these pro-lifers don't really care about people's actual lives.  These fetuses in question are just a concept.  Like kittens on the internet.  Because if they actually valued human beings, they would look at everyone involved.  They would try to help.

1164
i've been writing for awhile now that donald trump is good for republican voters--and therefore for everyone else.<br/><br/>trump does not have to adhere to republican ideology--ie, push the policies espoused by the donor class.  in fact, he can say whatever he wants, almost.  what in fact he's doing, while contradicting the establishment, is demonstrating to voters that they've been lied to by the echo chamber.<br/><br/>sooner or later, repub voters will realize the sources of their ignorance and, one would hope, "think" at least the way trump does--which on some issues is halfway rational.

1165
Why is it that gun owners (and supportive politicians, and the "Supreme" Court) think that their "right" to shoot firearms always trumps the rights of all other citizens to live life free of fear of being shot, and the right to life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness?<br/><br/>******A Connecticut physician

1166
We live in a nation where, apparently, the right to shoot a gun wherever and whenever is absolute. Gun owners' rights trump everything. Everything. That includes our right to hike or camp, our right to enjoy ancient art and artifacts, our right to not be shot as we go about our daily lives. This insanity will never stop; Newtown and its aftermath proved that to me. Our gutless -- GUTLESS -- politicians will always cave to the threats of the NRA. 

1167
Yes, they are more important. The campers and hikers do no harm. The shooters are destructive and dangerous whether they intend to be so or not. I am sick to death of gunners claiming all the rights and none of the responsibilities. Civil society trumps your right to wave your gun at me. 

1168
Lipstick- I was struck by the number of "rights" used in our comment. How appropriate. Isn't that the basis of this whole argument? My rights trump your rights? My freedoms are more important than your freedoms? When do we start discussing the responsibility for practicing those rights, responsibilities with accountability and finally when will we use our " free speech" to call out politicians who defund those agencies charged with enforcing accountability? Or then again, maybe "speech is money" and "money is speech" and that's what determines who's rights and freedoms rule?

1169
It really is time to refer to this "trigger trash" for what it really is; white trash' (proprietary eponyms).  These cretins believe their Right to their right to shoot, destroy, and lay waste trumps the right of all others to their Right to liberty, peace, and respite.  It's the contemporary American way; right down to the 'F*#k You' bumper stickers and the vapid HD riders on their sleds who need guns and, or glass packs to compensate.  It's disgusting to men and women who understand there is another way, but have too much decency or cowardice to call these degenerates out for what they truly are.

Her and trump both have abysmal business records, and zero political experience. A close family member had worked for HP for a couple decades when fiorina took over. She took early retirement because of the mess fiorina made of the company, and especially the way her policies targeted older workers. <br/><br/>The republican primary is a very poorly conducted circus, and their clowns are the creepy scary horror film kind. <br/><br/>Hasn't everyone figured out yet that bush is going to be the nominee? It is as inevitable as mitt was in 2012, and as inevitable as a Clinton White House in 2017.

1171
I would say media has hit trump extremely hard and from both sides of the street. Trump has also made quite bit of money for others in the numerous successes he has had. Trump has been involved in so much that some has bound to fail. Some not of his making, All casinos in Atlantic City got killed with so many others getting in on the band wagon. Let CA go full steam into casinos and Vegas will dry up. I will never vote for Trump but the facts are the facts. His hotels and real estate in NYC has done quite well bringing large returns for investors.

This is where we are today.  Gun owners' "right" to shoot indiscriminately on public land and potentially cause grievous injury trumps the rights of others to use that land safely and with little impact to the land or others.<br/><br/>At some point we need to understand that these are "traditions" we can live without.  And until then we can continue to have needless death and the resulting shrugging of shoulders, as if we're children too stupid to know better, even though we do.

1174
Professor Yamaguchi is correct. As poll after poll shows the vast majority of Japanese people are fearful of this illegal change in the constitution precisely because as one US Japan expert in Tokyo explained, "no one here wants to become America's deputy sheriff in Asia." The Japanese fear US militarism and its reckless habit of stirring up conflict and wars around the world to feed the military industrial complex. They are not that worried about China. This is the reality but it is a reality that goes against the narrative that the US is being "reluctantly" dragged into the islands disputes on behalf of Japan and other Asian countries to counter China the US media are as loyal geopolitical aides to Washington pushing. The Asian countries do see a use for the US as a counterweight to China's rise but they wisely do not trust the US's "war first" habits and are deeply fearful of being drawn into a trumped up conflict with China constructed by the US. History has shown that in Asia (and elsewhere) this is what the US does -- creates a false premise for a conflict and rushes in. The Japanese people are educated and informed. The damages from the US's recent reckless and ill thought out (for everybody but the war profiteers) military adventures are evident. The Japanese don't want anything to do with it but Abe ignores the will of the people and the US cheers their good ally Abe on. Poor Asia! US attention via the Pacific Pivot will bring what US meddling always does conflict.

Sometimes telling the truth trumps civility.

Finality trumping justice seems inherently unfair, and certainly so in the case of Mr. Gilbert.  However, it does not seem too cynical to think that these most recent pardons and prison visits are part of a coordinated political effort along with the #blacklivesmatter gang to not let a crisis go to waste.<br/><br/>In any event, the old cliche "don't do the crime if you can't do the time" is still applicable. If these mostly poor, black drug dealers chose another path in life, these arguments would be moot.

1177
Government is not a business. So the point you make is a good one. President Obama had worked at all levels of government, local state and national, which made him so well suited for the job. trump and Fiorina have nothing in their backgrounds to even suggest they might be qualified, and in fact many of the things they have said and proposed show they are dangerously ignorant of how government and law works. And neither of them has a very good business record...trump having four corporate bankruptcies under his belt so far....<br/><br/>We have had one person with an MBA as president. He was hands down the worst president since the Civil War era, if not of all time. Before him, the "successful businessman" president of the 20th century? Herbert Hoover. History suggests that working in the business world is a completely different skill set than running our country.

The best programmer I ever worked with used to THINK out his tasks completely before writing code. He made whole engineering drawings out of points in a database. When business slowed down, he was the first to be let go because he sat at his desk. He planned his work, researched technical questions, thought it all out beforehand, then started coding until he finished the program, but he didn't LOOK busy enough to management. He was head and shoulders above the rest of the programmers we had, and first to go.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder if churning nonsense in a spreadsheet to look busy trumps actual thought these days, as well.

Doesn't matter.  If it's public land, it's just that... publicly owned.  How I feel about how that land gets used is just as important as anyone else's opinion.  However, safety of everyone should trump childish gun behavior.

Adverse possession is a legal concept in our law and always has been.  It says that if someone moves onto your property that you are not using and treats it well, and you know about this and do nothing to assert ownership, and the situation continues for years, then that person gets the right to stay and you cant kick them out.  We let the illegals sneak in and used them for years as cheap labor while giving them the shaft in various ways.  I think some of them earned citizenship by adverse possession, as it were.  <br/><br/>This is a part of our law in which fairness and common sense trump absolute property rights.  

1183
The difference is that Obama never trumpeted himself as a successful businessman. Fiorina has trumpets her business experience all the time, so lack of success in that arena is fair game.

1184
i agree.  before trump's "build a wall" and "send all the illegals back", i actually thought he would effectively lead republican voters away from republican ideological nonsense.<br/><br/>but this immigration stuff takes the cake.  so, it's up to the press, at each opportunity, to ask trump exactly how he's going to force mexico to pay for the wall and how much he thinks it would cost.  and to ask him how much he's prepared to spend of taxpayer money to round up and send back "the illegals" and their "legal" children.  <br/><br/>when he tries to turn away, get loud and aggressive.  call him the kind of names he calls others--like "dummy":  ie., "hey dummy, do you realize how much that would cost the taxpayers?" don't back down.

"Nor does Mr. Trump inspire confidence as a possible international leader .............."<br/><br/>That is putting it mildly, to say the least. <br/><br/>Donald Trump's modus operandi is to licence the "Trump" name to anyone who wants to use it and serve as the official "exaggerator" for the licensed project or product.  His name is synonymous with inflated valuations and preposterous claims. It is a remarkable coincidence that the expression "trumped up" existed before he did. Can you imagine him dealing with Angela Merkel, or the leadership of China?<br/><br/>Has he ever shown a sensitive understanding or a creative approach or a deft touch at anything?  If the "bull in a china shop" approach is what you want, Donald is your guy. Otherwise, forget it.

"The same Clinton who didn't make any serious efforts to stamp down Osama bin Laden?"<br/><br/>I hope the NY Times makes this reply a reader pick so everyone can see how wrong you are.<br/><br/>(1) President Clinton authorized the CIA to kill OBL in 1998.<br/><br/>(2)  From CNN, 8/20/98:  "American cruise missiles pounded sites in Afghanistan and Sudan Thursday in retaliation for the August 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  U.S. officials say the six sites attacked in Afghanistan were part of a network of terrorist compounds near the Pakistani border that housed supporters of Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden." <br/><br/>(3)  More importantly, read the the 9/11 Commission Report, where you will find the assessment that the needlessly trumped-up Monica Lewinsky/impeachment business -- the most shameful partisan work in history -- was a distraction to President Clinton in doing better at getting OBL.  Chalk that up to Republicans, led in part by Newt Gingrich, who was having his own affair.   <br/><br/>(4)  You'll also find in the 9/11 Commission Report -- and this is important -- that the only serious person trying to stop OBL in the early days of the Bush II administration was Richard Clarke . . . who was retained from the Clinton Administration.  No one on team Bush was listening.<br/><br/>Give me a break, indeed.

Headlines that trumpet (ok, pun intended) "the most important story" are automatically suspect. We are, of course, in the midst of what we like to call  the "slow news" season, though as usual, the Brits have a much better term: the "silly season."  Nate Cohn has a fine statistical mind, but as a political prognosticator he strikes me as wet behind the ears, lacking the rubbing-shoulders-with-real-life experience of such eminent Times predecessors as James Reston and Tom Wicker.  A candidate's authenticity - or at least the ability to project authenticity - has always been essential to success. It's what elevated George H.W. Bush to the presidency (years of public service), ushered in Bill Clinton (essentially good-hearted, foxy, Southern charm),  capsized the younger "Mission-Accomplished" Bush, and sank the presidential hopes of shape-shifting Mitt Romney. Right now, Donald Trump is out in front because he's the authentic village fool (long a figure of respect in Russian culture).  A plausible, galvanizing candidate has to come off as who he or she really is, which is why the presumptive nominees, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, aren't looking so good right now - and are unlikely to look much better as time goes on. But we're still in the silly season. Let's enjoy it while we can.

The problem with opinions is that everyone has one or more and most......well lets just say do not rise up to perfume. Objectiveness is a relative term depending on which rose colored glasses through which you are making the observation and as such most opinions are just .... worthless and our politicians are a prime example of worthlessness.   Stuart made a mockery of the sacrosanct and self "importantness" of politicians and self declared leaders of nothing. We take ourselves too seriously and think that what we think means anything to any politicians short of getting them reelected to their guilded thrones in whatever power center to which they aspire.  Journalists too have lost their credibility thus their position of trust. Instead of reporting they are trying to influence readers or report false news or bias the news against some group. Reporters take sides to pursue and persuade others to their political positions of self importance or whatever the position is of their employers or power handlers. The 4th estate is no longer credible.  The days of Water Cronkite and others are over. We need the likes of the Stuarts to rip apart the overzealous, the self important, the pompous nabobs, the trump types, the bush types the Obama types who think their "poopie" is roses and lavender.

Jennifer:<br/><br/>Of course, being the first female CEO of a top company is a tremendous accomplishment.  Why do you think people are working so hard to drag that particular experience down so low?  <br/><br/>It's highly partisan.  Fiorina is a powerful and successful woman.  Were she a democrat, every Fiorina-basher here would be charged with "sexism"  and God knows what other identity infractions.  How many would claim that the input of men should be ignored?  The fact that most female CEO's suffered the same fate would be trumpeted in her defense.<br/><br/>They will try to drag her down, but will expose their own politically-guided standards in the process.  

1191
Well, Bette, I can tell you that this article describes a real situation and a real problem.  I've lived in rural communities in the woods all my life.  I've even done my share of target shooting on National Forest land.  But now it has become way out of hand.  Shooters think they have a right to unload anywhere, any time, and their "rights" trump everyone else's.  Unless the shooting community can get a handle on the irresponsible individuals blasting away where they shouldn't, strict regulation will be the answer.  And I, for one, will welcome it.

1192
I have a right to not have guns near me or to have to fear for my life because of people carrying guns.  It trumps the gun nut's "right" to carry a lethal weapon.

“A good New York slice trumps every kind of pizza,” he says.<br/><br/>Beg to differ.  Head to New Haven.  It's not far.  And you can get a small pie for the price of a few NY slices.

"Black lives matter."<br/><br/>Say it often enough, and trump up false charges against an organization that provides mammograms and other women's health services to poor women of all skin tones, and suddenly your refrain loses meaning.

It seems increasingly that gun enthusiasts' rights trump all.

Fascinating...<br/><br/>I have no issue with those that are capable of maintaining healthy, polyamorous relationships (if such individuals actually exist). But Ashley Madison members are clearly the opposite of that. Those that partake in its "services" represent the worst of our warped attitude towards sex and love. In a world where deceit is the norm--in business, relationships, and marriage--Ashley Madison is the logical endpoint of an ethos where ego, and self-gratification, trumps all. <br/><br/>Perhaps the hackers are saving us from ourselves? And providing a bizarre (yet despetately needed) ) moral compass, in a post-religous society.

1197
Make no mistake, conservatives are not completely against government intervention in the private sector but very much prefer instead to see it done on behalf of the wealthy. Thus the term "compassionate conservative" revived by George Bush made such a stir because it is strange to see those two words juxtaposed. For conservatives ideology will always trump compassion. No-one should be surprised at the Walker and Rubio plans

The medical profession emphatically disagrees with you, ebmem and Mark. Those so-called "upgraded standards" serve only to limit the availability of necessary medical care for women.<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with money, and everything to do with creepy people seeking to commandeer the rights and lives of women just because those creepy people think their morals somehow trump women's personal, private, proprietary morals.<br/><br/>The "choice" these creepy people are forcing on women's bodies against their will is nothing short of immoral.

1199
The supposed journalists who cover the campaigns are stuck in mire of scandal attacks and responses. The supposedly "tough" questions from the Fox debate as usual dealt questions that all of these clowns share positions on. <br/><br/>Destruction of Social Security, in the interim yet another rise in retirement age that accomplishes nothing, destruction of Medicare, Medicaid, Expanded Medicaid and a whole range of other reactionary and radical. Yet the "journalists" largely ignore these critical issues and the factual basis underlying each program including the relatively trivial funding needed long term in some cases.<br/><br/>The problem is that so many of "journalists" over time have come to believe the false arguments of the right to be fact based. They aren't but why bother when for all the bemoaning of past coverage, not much has changed.  Chuck Todd covered the trivia well with trump -- but I didn't hear any serious questions about vital programs. <br/><br/>People who are convinced they will live to 100 and still playing racquet ball or tennis don't get the reality. People continue to retire at essentially the same age, whatever SSA reductions are made or their lack of Medicare. Obamacare will help some. Most older workers encounter age discrimination. Those who don't are lucky or well placed for other reasons. <br/><br/>The table (and others in the linked paper deal with the factual side. What campaigns do is to focus on the trivial - and if people elect any of these clowns they will get trouble.

I said this before and I'll say it again: Illegal immigrants' financial drain is nothing compared to the drain corporations and oligarchs cause by hiding their profits  off-shore to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. They are allowed to hide their wealth gained on the backs of Americans!<br/><br/>To pounce on the poor immigrant children who may, just may, turn into patriots and pay taxes is myopic, mean spirited and foolish, a trait Americans developed by allowing the Republican Party to hold sway over so many of us, yet give full license to some "citizens" (corporations) to selfishly exploit everyone else. <br/><br/>I'm not saying to open borders completely or allow all illegals to stay, but turn the problem around intelligently, not throw tantrums, spew inchoate, blind hatred and show how foolish we are as a people, unable to reason. We must show class by trumping Trump, who articulates what so many deluded people feel.<br/><br/>How twisted this country has become.

1201
Re: "it's pretty much accepted that if we didn't have such a large number of illegal aliens, we wouldn't have as much crime."<br/><br/>No, I don't accept that assertion.  Do you have any evidence?  Bear in mind that the anecdotal evidence often used by Mr. Trump for, I suspect, the demagogic reason that it's difficult to dispute (such as, did you hear about the undocumented immigrant who stabbed someone?) is insignificant, given the population.  Statistics, based on research and sound interpretation, would be much more compelling.<br/><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798" title="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798" target="_blank">http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-a...</a><br/><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/" title="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/" target="_blank">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-tr...</a><br/><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/06/memo-to-trump-and-his-gop-debate-buddies-quit-lying-about-immigrants.html" title="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/06/memo-to-trump-and-his-gop-debate-buddies-quit-lying-about-immigrants.html" target="_blank">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/06/memo-to-trump-and-his-g...</a>

Our political system is in need of a reformation, one where we eliminate the middlemen who mediate and translate the meaning of things.  That time has come because the middlemen have lost control of the message.  The internet is this age what the Guttenburg press was to the Catholic church.  And it threatens to dethrone the entrenched power brokers and their handlers.<br/>Trumps appeal is the same and Fiora's appeal and Carson's appeal.  They come from the real world in which one engages with others...enemies, friends, whatever..and solves problems.  They are not part of  the Talking Class, to which politicians and political pundits, including journalists, belong.  What problem did a journalist ever solve?  They just talk and talk.  They write ephemeral little pieces, skipping the surface of complex issues.  And as much as I love Cruz's oratory, he should have been a plaintiff's lawyer.  We need a problem solver.  We passed up a great one last election for an icon which reified the left's passions.  Now the left has issues with an icon of the right that reifies its passions.  What irony.  But trump is more than Obama, as are Carson and Fiorina.  Take Carson--pundits say he has no experience.  This is a man who studies complex problems, works in a team of others, all with large egos, considers alternatives, and then engages with an issue.  Those are the skills we need.  Trump has those skills but with bluster.  Their cabinets will advise; but they are decision makers.

bush needs to figure out a way to distance himself from the iraq war and the likelihood of future interventions.  lying about iraq doesn't help; it simply proves he's as delusional as the other candidates.<br/><br/>and bush also needs to figure out how to distance himself from trump's dystopian immigration "policy"--build a big wall and round them all up, even the "legal" children, and have taxpayers pay for it.  until trump uttered this<br/>nonsense, i thought he was "good" for repubican voters, distancing himself from ideology.<br/><br/>now, i can't see anyone else but bush. but, good grief . . .  i suppose kasich has time to make a charge.

AAC-Except many of the children are CITIZENS!! How do we deport a person to a country that is not theirs by birth? Are you really this obtuse? And where are the cries to deport anchor baby Jindal? If you want to change the law by all means change it!! But don't hold your breath about anything being done by our corporate owned politicians who like the status quo just fine. More cheap labor to exploit and a means to depress wages even further which means more money in their pockets.<br/>And BTW where is your outrage at the expansion of the H1B Visa program which depresses wages in the good technical industry jobs? The silence is deafening. This is nothing more than racism covered with some transparent lie that the republicans are concerned about the wages, health and well being of the average citizen. If they were sooo concerned about us they wouldn't be proposing gutting  EPA and other government oversight, the public education system, undermining the union gains through the years, destroying SS and Medicare, abolishing  ACA and going back to the status quo, undermining workers' rights, involving us in another trumped up war, refusing to repair our vital infrastructure, and so opposed to a living wage or an increase in minimum wage.<br/>But just keep believing in the fairytale. Just don't come crying to the rest of us when all their worse nightmares come true and we become a third world fascist nation. I hope you'll enjoy reaping the "harvest" that you've allowed to be sown.

I'll first take exception to the claim that “Sellers spend their lives in terror wondering when they will be next ones to get suspended over trumped up charges.” As an Amazon seller, I'm thrilled at the exceptional treatment I get, my ability to try selling art on Amazon without spending a dime unless it sells. Amazon is the most generous resource freelance artists and writers have ever had. I haven't spent one second "in terror." This comment, I'd guess, from someone trying to push the edges on Amazon content and afraid of getting caught.<br/><br/>Amazon has a very open, available appeal process and a forum full of veterans who will help if you get in trouble. The comment is completely untrue.<br/><br/>I have to add that Amazon has generously provided me a totally free platform for publishing a dozen books. Their templates and guidelines are extremely helpful. The simplicity of rolling over content to Kindle is breathtaking. <br/><br/>The Amazon article wasn't completely fair. The Public Editors observations yesterday were insightful. Many have speculated that the Times has thing for "getting" Amazon. The tone of the article does nothing to refute that claim, but I would add that this newspaper similarly delights in hammering Apple. <br/><br/>As the smarmy article notes with pride, the article has hurt Amazon. The writer here revels subtly in that achievement.

1206
Yes, "suffering trumps ideology," as the authors write. But death trumps suffering. All the animals held in marginally larger cages, cage-free sheds (these are often  as cramped and dirty as the cages) and even open pastureland will be killed for their meat or milk. (Dairy cows have nasty and short lives). Veganism is the only practical (as well as morally ethical) stance in the face of the enormous scale of killing. If the major welfare organizations would spend as much on promoting abolitionism as they do on welfarism, the number of vegans would surely rise significantly and the quantity of animal death and suffering decline accordingly. Prof. Francione may be the true pragmatist!

Dan Stackhouse - I'm not expecting you to change your mind and I wasn't trying to get you to do so.  I'm just pointing out the realities of the situation.<br/><br/>We could do all kinds of great things if we cut the military budget but where is the political will needed to do that?<br/><br/>The people in places like Ferguson are in urban areas, farms are in rural areas (I grew up in California's Central Valley).<br/><br/>Prison labor can be tricky, there are security issues, liability issues etc.  I'm not saying it's not a good idea but that doesn't mean it can be implemented.<br/><br/>Opinions are great but facts are tricky things and they tend to trump opinions most of the time.

1208
Don’t get me wrong, I hate Donald Trump as much as the next college educated woman in 2015. His comments about women and plan for immigration are truly “bananas”, and who wants this guy as the leader of their country? <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NsrwH9I9vE" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NsrwH9I9vE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NsrwH9I9vE</a><br/><br/>However, you’re helping rather than hurting his cause by spewing so much hatred about how ridiculous his campaign is. Sure, it is absurd. But stop treating him like a second class candidate and actually take him seriously, or you risk moving more conservatives towards accepting his point of view because they hate yours. The way the NYT has dismissed his campaign from the beginning (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/16/us/elections/donald-trump.html)" title="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/16/us/elections/donald-trump.html)" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/16/us/elections/donald-trump....</a> actually causes Republicans to take a second look Donald Trump and try and justify his views. Most conservatives hate and distrust the liberal media so much that they automatically assume the opposite of what you say is correct. Why not quit the “Is this guy for real?” act and present Trump’s actions and words without commentary, and let people see for themselves how “bananas” this guy really is? 

1209
FYI, here's the opening of Trump's position paper:<br/><br/>"When politicians talk about “immigration reform” they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders. The Schumer-Rubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties. <br/><br/>"Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first – not wealthy globetrotting donors. We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own. That must change. ...<br/><br/>"1. A nation without borders is not a nation. There must be a wall across the southern border. <br/><br/>"2. A nation without laws is not a nation. Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced. <br/><br/>"3. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation. Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans."<br/><br/>You can read the whole thing for yourself here:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform" title="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform" target="_blank">https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform</a>

What we need to do is not take trump seriously.  He's a deliberate boogyman.  He's good at it.  Everyone wants to hear what new outrage will escape his lips.  The only people who should really be upset with him are those Republican candidates who don't like to see themselves as clowns, but are forced to be in the clown car with him.

1211
a simple man, as mr trump is, can only create simply ideas. listening to him talk so much of himself showcases a character flaw that is dangerous. but as the showman he is not to blame for seeking a crowd it is the crowd that should be looked at with scorn. how can a shallow self absorbed ego speak to you?

1212
obviously farhorizons doesn't see the forest from the trees, vote trump = scalia's

1213
Generally, men just love this kind of stuff.  Show 'em who's boss.  This issue will trump (sorry) all others as far as most of them are concerned.  Sex and domination are always the winners, for these males, in such backward places...and Texas.  If not, why aren't they doing something about it?

1214
"As pundits are discovering to their horror, there’s probably more to the Trump phenomenon than mere celebrity."<br/><br/>i think it's called charisma. trump appears to transcend logic and inferential box-making. odds seem to be growing that this might actually be one of those historic elections where the establishment gets turned upside down. i wonder if the dems are starting to realize that hillary is a horrible candidate and unelectable even with a huge electoral college advantage. 

1215
Supreme Court has been the shining hope of justice in India, certainly in the recent years. It is appalling to see so-called the author make no mention of the Supreme Court's verdict exonerating Modi of any guilt, while trumpeting about the same Supreme Court granting bail to Setalvad. Also, glaringly enough, he ignores the report submitted by SIT, again constituted by Supreme Court, on the reasons behind Godhra train burning. These were THE most important milestones in the 2004 riots investigation so far. And the author choosing to ignore them makes his intentions and bias very clear.<br/>In fact, Modi's role in 2004 riots is the most scrutinized and investigated case of the recent times in India and that too while the Congress party was in power, lest he be accused of manipulating the judgement. Fortunately, the people of India placed their trust on the verdict of the constitutional bodies, not on presstitues, as we in India fondly call sold-reporters.<br/>In the case of Ms Setalvad, does the author claim that there were no irregularities in the operations of her organization? That the NGOs of the likes of Ford Foundation are no holy cows of the society is proven beyond question. 

1216
I once worked under a young and inexperienced director who would lash out when stressed, which was most of the time. I regularly worked nights and weekends, a regime that was sometimes necessary but more often was about displaying loyalty and a willingness to accept unreasonable demands. She pitted employees against one another and created more bad feeling than a cat at a dog convention. <br/><br/>When a bout of flu went through the office, I was the only one in my division who didn't get sick. My boss and most of my coworkers were out for a full week while I held down the fort. Right after, I took a single day off to tend to a young child home from school with a bad cold (this was my first personal day of the year). Throughout the entire day, my boss called me continually with one trumped up "crisis" after the other and raked me over the coals for taking the day off. The next day, during a staff meeting, she berated me in front of my co-workers for having the wrong priorities. <br/><br/>Like you, I soon quit and found a better job. Sometimes I think people are just nuts. They had trouble filling my position. Within another year they sidelined the director into a non-supervisory role before terminating her altogether. <br/><br/>Bad leadership is endemic and costs the nation mightily in terms of economics, health, and emotionally well being. I still can't drive past this workplace, years later, without a wave of bitterness washing over me. 

1217
I saw this disingenuous Sen. on CNN yesterday and I couldn't believe I knew more about this deal than a man with his position of importance in the Congress. I was trying to figure out where the connection to Israeli monies were because he was parroting their talking points no with no regard for the facts. The thing that bothers me more then the Republicans sharing one brain cell amongst themselves and never deviating when it comes to opposing all things Obama, is when a Democrat chooses to stand with them, giving credence to their cause by following the same flawed logic. I thought our side was the smart one but it turns out venality trumps logic when it comes time to count the political contributions. The Sen. is quoted as saying "If Iran gets a nuclear weapon, I don't want my name to be on it". Let's hope the people of N.Y. and N.J. make sure both Sen. Menendez and Schumer's names are erased from their office doors as soon as possible. I don't expect everyone in the Democratic party to think the same way about everything (as the Republicans do) but I do expect them to think.

1218
Another case of lobbying trumping evidence and ethics. Also, if it were not for the gross overuse of hysterectomy and ovary / gonad removal, both of which cause permanent harm (sexual, anatomical, skeletal, hormonal), there would be little need for this type of drug.<br/><br/>The big story should be about the gross overuse and harm of female organ removal. At least 90% of hysterectomies are unnecessary although the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says 70% are unnecessary (still a concerning figure). And equally troubling is that healthy ovaries / gonads are also removed 55% of the time (all ages) and 78% of the time in women ages 45-64 despite the average woman’s less than 2% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and numerous studies showing the many increased health risks of ovary removal. An intact woman’s ovaries produce hormones that are essential for good health until at least age 80.

1219
Politicians really need to hark when perfectly reasonable non-racist and non-xenophobic  people speak out in such numbers about illegal migration in the US. People are upset, so upset that many of them are backing Trump. And that is very telling.<br/>No one is against immigration, what people are upset about, and tired of, is illegal migration. If other candidates (of both parties) do not heed this, then it really could be Trump who trumps the lot of them. 

1220
Have hope, which is a virtue.  The DOJ is calling the local judge to act fairly, not as they did at Ferguson where they arrested black people on trumped up charges and then levied unfair legal fees to raise money for the county.  Is it overstepping to make sure that they do their jobs right?

1221
During his term in office President Carter asked our nation to have a serious look in the mirror and what did we do?   <br/><br/>In unison we loudly rejected and belittled his sage advise.<br/><br/>Now forward to today and now we have many of those same people that belittled this advise are now hypocritically praising President Carter for his moral upstanding and body of good works.  <br/><br/>It seems clear to me that our petty, ignorant and myopic nation clearly did not deserve good human beings like President Carter nearly four decades ago and certainly does not deserve him today.<br/><br/>Because, our nation has chosen the path of destruction in the belief that the selfish, self-interests of 320 million individuals trumps that of having a nation with one voice that is committed to do good for all of humanity.

1222
Demonizing Mexico (and the Mexican people) in the name of immigration "reform" is nothing less than simplistic sound bite politics trying to a address a very complicated problem. This article in the August 18th issue of the The Economist is the best think I've read thus far on the subject. pol<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/08/donald-trump-immigration-reform?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/blamemexico" title="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/08/donald-trump-immigration-reform?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/blamemexico" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/08/donald-trump-i...</a>

The Republican Party that sought to reform itself after Romney's divisive performance in 2012 failed for one reason: the "Personality Type" it continually welcomes to its ranks.<br/><br/>A generation ago, Republican leaders spoke like Democratic leaders -- with a tone of inclusiveness. Now, every one of those leaders inhabits a "Personality Type": the Me-Me type whose selfish agenda trumps (pun intended) compromise and wholly dismisses everyone who is not part of the clique.<br/><br/>What's intensely captivating about this election season is that the GOP presidential aspirants are so clueless of their liabilities, they can't recognize that their Party's meltdown has already begun....

1224
Forward thinking cities?  Are you mad?  Legal citizens are paying for benefits for illegals?  Know what they call that?  Encouragement.<br/><br/>Liberals often cite the "enlightened" attitudes of europe on things like gun control and health care.  Do any of them throw their borders open to any and all without a regard as to what the benefit is?  Hello?  Anyone?<br/><br/>Once again, I think that the Times is letting it's liberal bias trump (HA!) it's common sense.  You think, I suspect, that stacking the electoral deck with poor illegals made legal will assure democratic victories.  If that is so, it is really sad.

1225
Trump's paternal grandfather immigrated from Germany.  I think The Donald should be required to produce documents proving the legality of his citizenship.  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigration-principles-wouldve-barred-his-own-grandfather/401600/" title="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigration-principles-wouldve-barred-his-own-grandfather/401600/" target="_blank">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigr...</a>

1226
If you read Trumps position paper, it is actually quite well-thought out, full of common sense, and will be effective. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform" title="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform" target="_blank">https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform</a><br/><br/>The establishment politicians can huff and puff all they want, but the American people will support Trump if nobody else will bring any rationality to the issue.

1227
For heaven's sake, stop making the showing of passion the litmus test for concern over an issue.  To be sure, we assume that a loud assertion of interest is a sign of sincerity but sincerity does not translate into action.  It reminds of what Pogo said long ago:<br/>"If we are so sincere, how can we be wrong".  Well, you can. Seemingly, and a lot of his followers believe it, Trump is sincere and passionate when he says that he is going to deport 11 million people and, moreover, get the Mexican government pay for it.  Can the impossibility of this plan trump sincerity?  It certainly can.  So, give me an earnest but quiet person who has a rational project in mind and I will gladly give you the bombastic<br/>orator who provokes unthinking shouts of enthusiasm.

1228
There's a lot of self-righteous indignation against the death penalty, but I'm just curious:  what is the liberal argument against executing the two home invaders mentioned in the article?  Both are white, and so there's no concern about the penalty being racist.  There is overwhelming evidence of guilt, i.e. we "know" they did it as they were caught at the scene and so there is no concern about executing someone who is innocent. The crime was also committed in the most cold, deliberate way you can think of.  In short, none of the typical objections to the death penalty apply here.  The only possible objection is that "life is sacred" or the "government doesn't have the right to take a life" argument, but really, these guys committed the most horrific act imaginable.  Why spend a moment trying to preserve their lives? It would be like mourning the death of Osama Bin Laden; it makes no sense.  Further, the surviving family member, the father, wants them executed; that desire trumps whatever other objection you could have to it.  I just wish Greenhouse would spend some time being morally outraged about this crime.

Yes, "shooting star" candidates come and go, but they can draw enough attention away from voters to influence the outcome. Trump looks likes he's doing it to help Hillary and Ross Perot did it for Bill <a href="http://www.iagreetosee.com/portfolio/before-trump-there-was-ross-perot/" title="http://www.iagreetosee.com/portfolio/before-trump-there-was-ross-perot/" target="_blank">http://www.iagreetosee.com/portfolio/before-trump-there-was-ross-perot/</a>

It sounds like the glorification of the physician and the urge for profit making trumps mere human lives every time, if those lives are merely female.

Which charges in Ferguson were "trumped up"?

This is unbelievable.  Mayor windshield advocating for more car space to stop the trumped up controversy of a few painted ladies.  This guy is a limousine liberal in the worst sense.  What a clown.

What good is individual consultation between patient and doctor?  Unless there are high-confidence studies that match that particular patient (which is generally not the case), it's just speculation with no data.<br/><br/>The way to discover truth is with science.  But science can take decades to arrive at meaningful results, and it's *hard*.  You need large numbers of subjects, you need random treatment assignments, you need controls, you need blinding, and none of it is subject to popularity contests - pink ribbon campaigns will not speed the process, and will probably hinder it.  And it's quite possible that there will be no cure, and people will continue dying of disease as they always have.  The universe doesn't care.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter how much the press trumpet "promising" approaches, it doesn't matter how much people want, demand, or think they deserve a cure.  If you rush the science, you will get incorrect results.

In this republic debate I feel that Donald trump did show potential. I felt that he is a good candidate for running for president. However, in the past year that I have seen with the president that they vote was that the people would get mad at them because they would focused on things that didn’t matter to them in some of the topics. In my opinion I think that Donald Trump will go as far to meet with Hilary at the end of the elections. However, I think that Donald Trump is making a huge mistake when it comes to the topic of immigrants. The whole reason why that is these people are the ones who pick up the berries, nuts, etc. If these immigrants are brought back then who will do their job and why will they send back their entire family back. I don’t know Donald Trump’s intentions with the immigrants but I think that there will be a lot of commotions with this subject. At first I didn’t believe that Donald Trump was going to run for president that I thought it was a joke but after investigating I thought that Donald Trump wants to change and form a whole new nation for the next generations. I can see that Donald Trump is a well-respected man in his social statues so I believe that with the right amount of determination as well as confidence like many other people not just him can accomplish what they want and all that is left is time to tell us what to do. In conclusion i believe no matter where you come from it is how you do it that will take you to the finish line.

1236
Jude, you didn't write a politically correct opinion piece, but as you know, war isn't politically correct.  Though I support full societal equality regardless of sex, in this one small area, mission capability and unit psychology trump political correctness.  Human nature and evolution have set in motion this reality that we have before us, but some will still cry foul, as if ensuring a maximally capable war fighting ability in order to maintain a nation where our rights are secure from tyranny, is less important than offending those who think that political correctness is paramount.

1237
while I agree wholeheartedly with sanders, I simply doubt that the kind of changes that he correctly calls for could ever be made into political reality short of a revolution. I think that it is time for a woman president so I will support Hillary. The issues brought up by the gop and papers such as the nyt are to some extent unfair. Benghazi -told to leave so Ben who? previous secretaries have used their own email (and the the hackers were not looking there). all pols have a closet of issues and I do not trust any pol. so w/ trump and sanders we have an extreme right and an extreme left.

1238
One of the great things about Bernie is that he's stationed himself at the bow of The Goodship America, providing visionary guidance on where the country could go.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the aft stand a crowd of hyperbolic trumpeters looking at the wake over the stern and longing for the so-called "good old days" ("Make America Great Again!").  <br/><br/>Odds are we'll probably end up with someone who is looking either out of a port or starboard porthole .... but wouldn't it be refreshing to feel the rush of a fresh breeze pouring over The Goodship?

1239
“Everything he said is true,” Mr. Bowes said. “Implementing what he says is next to impossible.”<br/><br/>You know what? The most important thing right now is that someone in a position to be heard is saying what more and more of us are thinking. Go get em Bernie. <br/><br/>Up here in red necked Alberta we just elected the NDP because we were ALL sick of the same old stuffy politics that didn't serve anyone but the oil industry and the already entitled. <br/><br/>Bernie is right. Obama got elected by people he then left behind. Whether or not Bernie succeeds, my guess is that he will trump Trump in the long run up to 2016 and he will have a shot at the presidency. Right now what excites people about Trump and Bernie is that they have  passion and the courage of their convictions, except that Bernie's are right on and Trump's are dead wrong. Also Bernie speaks his truth to more than a narrow base. He speaks the truth to those of us who have been ignored and taken for granted - the vast middle. Go Bernie. Wish we had more of you up here.

1240
Bernie is not a life time marxist, and Mussolini was a fascist advocating for the society that trump advocates for. 

1241
"Academic politics is the most vicious and bitter form of politics, because the stakes are so low." <br/><br/>For many in your profession this is an academic argument. Since those involved in the argument do not have any direct responsibility for managing economies, protecting their turf and reputation may trump being technically 'right'.

1242
Oh the 'angry' card has been played! And then the 'Marxist' trump card!! All those women out there know when the 'angry' card is thrown down we're all supposed to say a real loud sorry. What if we're just not going to take it anymore? What if we actually do want our representatives to actually do the job We are paying them to do? What if we want them to actually represent average Americans improving our lives, our country, our water, our air, our infrastructure, our schools, our children's lives?  We've given our current crop of billionaire sycophants plenty of time and money to fulfill their oath of office but all we've gotten are wars, death and destruction on every front with no end in sight. We either do this now or we're not even going to have a planet to stand on. Thank God for Bernie and please take very good care of yourself.

1243
Paul, this isn't news. News would be finding some policy or fact Republicans trumpeted that turned out to be right. I honestly can't think of a single one.

1244
The similarities between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are fascinating.  Both of them are anti-establishment candidates who trumpet (no pun intended) the message "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not taking it any more!"  Sanders appeals to the far left who are disappointed in Obama and long for a socialist revolution.  Trump appeals to the right who feel the country is on a downhill slide, who long for someone who isn't bound by PC speech code, and who are fed up with millions of illegal immigrants slipping into the country.<br/><br/>The question is whether either Sanders or Trump can expand their base.  With Hillary firing bullets into herself every day, Sanders has a good opening.  Democrats need to watch out for Trump's appeal to blue-collar Democrats who see wage stagnation, jobs being taken by immigrants and a timid administration that's more interested in accommodation than pressing to advance America's position in the world.  A lot of these working class "Reagan Democrats" like what they're hearing from Trump.

1245
We have a deadlocked Congress that agrees on nothing and  a party ready to close down the government over Planned Parenthood. Obama´s ideas and programs are rejected just because they are his. How many times have the Republicans tried to remove the new health care coverages? They have yet to succeed but refuse to stop fighting it. Bernie Sander´s positiopns on many issues reflect what many people believe to be true. According to your article people should not vote for him because  his ideas will not work. Our government is gridlocked today and there seems to be little chance of improvement; so why not give Bernie Sanders a chance? Do you have a better idea to trump mine?

1246
Jack, you are wrong to assume that most black voters would not vote for Bernie Sanders. Bernie has been a better ally to blacks than Hillary could ever hope to be. Substance trumps style. While most Democratic voters (of any race) support Clinton right now, I expect more will switch over to Bernie's side in the coming weeks and months as the primary shifts into full gear. Blacks included.

1247
Just to remind Mr trump your family came probably from Irland or England they where also inmigrants to the USA. You want to build a wall so big among the border that you will need Mexicans,Latin Americans,Chinesse,etc,etc. to build it and then you pass the bill to the Mexican goverment to pay for it............<br/>be realistic without the latino vote your never make it

1248
It was interesting to see the caption of the first photo in this article which referred to Trump as having drawn "a crowd in Mobile, Alabama last night.<br/><br/>That's in contrast to an earlier NY Times article today whose headline seemed to be pointing out Trump's inability to fill the 40,000 capacity venue last night.<br/><br/>I am normally in agreement with the Times' position on most everything and would have a hard time envisioning considering a vote for Trump, but am put off by the very clear bias in that earlier article  ( <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/donald-trump-fails-to-fill-alabama-stadium-but-fans-zeal-is-undiminished.html?_r=0" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/donald-trump-fails-to-fill-alabama-stadium-but-fans-zeal-is-undiminished.html?_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/donald-trump-fails-to-fill-alabama-...</a> )<br/><br/>By all accounts Trump drew 30,000 people. Would the optics had been better if he could have selected a 30,000 capacity venue? Of course, but what exactly were the choices in Mobile?<br/><br/>One has to wonder what the headline would have been if Trump had gone with the next smaller venue, the Mobile Civic Center accommodates 10,000, leaving 20,000 hopeful attendees shut out in the dark?<br/><br/>Would he then have been castigated for creating a crowd of people unable to get what they had come for, under-estimating his own drawing power??<br/><br/>The story should not have highlighted empty seats in the headline, but could have acknowledged the impressive zeal expressed by a crowd large by any standard.<br/><br/>There's not much reason to take away from Trump's accomplishment. Undoubtedly, he will be able to do that on his own

Of course you may disagree with the eggs on the plate, but you cannot say they are not eggs.

Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States....etc

FLINT HILL, Va. — There is a deep economic anxiety driving Republican voters toward the blunt-spoken presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump. It is more than just anger at the political class or rebellion against political correctness. It reflects decades of lost jobs and falling wages for a swath of blue-collar Americans, who saw their opportunities diminish and developed a sense that someone has stolen something from them.<br/><br/><a href="http://napoleonlive.info/did-you-know/donald-trump-and-the-truth/" title="http://napoleonlive.info/did-you-know/donald-trump-and-the-truth/" target="_blank">http://napoleonlive.info/did-you-know/donald-trump-and-the-truth/</a>

ra - You misread; we never said 75% of GOP'ers would never vote for Trump - read our comment again.  As well, since 59% of GOP'ers told a Fox News Poll they ' would never vote for Trump ':<br/><br/><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/trump-most-disliked_n_7597722.html" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/trump-most-disliked_n_7597722.html" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/trump-most-disliked_n_7597722.html</a><br/><br/>as well as 21% saying they would not even support him as nominee, our statement that too little emphasis is given the number of GOP'ers who say they'll never pull the lever for DT is factually correct :)

1252
XD you clearly are an ignoramus conservative who watches fox news, Look at Scandivia's socialism, guess what it works, and it works way better than our mega billion dollar capitalist society, our country is controlled by people with butt loads of money, elect trump you elect someone who will only make it worse, elect sanders you will elect a man who will fix it, and if you are so american read the grapes of wrath and that in itself will defeat your argument in a heartbeat.

1253
Not sure about the general election, but he definitely seems a contender for the Republican nomination.

mr. sanders vs. mr. trump.  that is intriguing as opposed to ms. clinton vs. mr. bush.  

1255
I won't vote for Trump, but I find him neither as silly nor as odious a prospect as many here.<br/><br/>This is simply because, having asked a number of people why they are voting for Hillary - I have yet to receive a sensible reply that does not distill to "I think she'll be better for women."  <br/><br/>That she is a corrupt liar who absolutely means more of the same endless wars for oil/gas, bankers, and Israel doesn't matter -   women should get "free*" health care and that's a vital issue!!<br/><br/><a href="http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/21/donald-trump-wtf-democracy-can-be-rough" title="http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/21/donald-trump-wtf-democracy-can-be-rough" target="_blank">http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/21/donald-trump-wtf-democracy-can-be-rough</a><br/><br/>One begins to question the bare concept of 'democracy' when the stupid, the myopic, and the simply ill-informed are passionately attached to a candidate about whom they know very little.<br/><br/>___<br/>*paid for by someone else already paying for the old, the poor, and the illegal.

1256
I see your point, but President Sanders would lead the country in a good direction, whereas Donald would have to lead us into a major war in order to keep control. Nothing like a trumped-up emergency situation to scare voters into making stupid decisions.

1257
The Trumpism virus is spreading like crazy and attacking the people with low IQ and this virus will be around this summer and may be in fall season. By the end of this year, this virus will loose its power and strength and also people will be resistant . The media and reasonable people will learn how to fight the virus and find the cure. Until that day , reasonable people have to wait and fight back. The biggest trouble is now the media which is in collusion with this virus and trumpeting the news over and over and lot of good people are sick of it.

1258
It is quite fun watching all of the  politicians Adelson, Braman, et al, have window dressed for the American public fall ober themselves trying to figure out how to contend with the wild card, Trump. Trumps appeal is a facade of pure and simple American gumption. Being from a wealthy family He did not work his way up from the bottom, however, most of his fans probably believe so. Americans are just sick and tired of the pandering that is promoted as "issues" by all of the bought and sold politicians running for office. Citizens United did not level the playing field, however, Trumps money can trump anything the others throw at him. It is going to be a very good year for those who earn their living off of the political machine. and for those of us who relish watching the candidates (contestants as Trump correctly called them) eat each other alive, Trumps candidacy has assured us a good show. Keep on, keeping on, Donald.

1259
well looks like buc was right. but the difference with trump is he will actually do what he says, while a pol will hem and haw while the fire rages trump will send a fleet of b52's to drop water one it within a month of the oath! people are tired of progressives and rhinos. trump is a bright light so we can get out of the tunnel they put us in! 

1260
We are voting for trump because he is the only one whose serious about closing the border.  .

1261
what amazes me about trump is not only will he do what he says, but he crosses every ethnic walls everyone dems reps are going to vote for him, white black asian latino are all going to vote for him in droves! when has the 2 parties done that? we have a person who is uniting americans against the corruption of the 2 party's!

1262
I don't know why he's not called "trumpet", "trumpy"..or anything else 'cause all he does is blow his horn

1263
trump was referring to a specific woman, ie Rosie Odonnell, not all women!

1264
What trump is doing to the republican party is priceless.  He is such a gift.  This is a lot of fun.

1265
It's clear that we are being invaded by illegal aliens. Further both the democrats and GOPe are working to create what is basically a feudal command and control centrally planned fascist state. Trump is the cure:<br/><br/><a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/08/19/defeating-the-gope-road-map-a-message-to-donald-trump-and-ted-cruz-supporters/" title="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/08/19/defeating-the-gope-road-map-a-message-to-donald-trump-and-ted-cruz-supporters/" target="_blank">http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/08/19/defeating-the-gope-road-m...</a>

You call mass deportation orderly? Give me a break. There is no plan in his plan and if you listened beyond his vitriol and your own anger, you'd understand that his world view and its actual manifestation is deeply disturbing. Before you decide so unequivocally that his solutions are best, perhaps try getting out of your New York, well-paid, well-educated bubble and take a look into the eyes of a child from El Salvador who is running for their lives. If you can turn your back to that kind of suffering and your humanity has been stripped to that degree by politics, the media and your own callousness, then please, pull the lever for trump. Otherwise, consider yourself a lucky American who has no clue what the other half is living through.

It might seem like a minor flaw relative to the awesome feats he achieved in diving at two Olympic games, but it was not minor.  When he cut his head on that dive, he knew what the doctor did not.  And he knew, however minor the possibility in a pool of that size with all the chlorine and filtration systems, that the RISK of people contacting the AIDS virus was present.<br/>      That to me trumps the fair analysis about the fear and homophobia that did exist in the 80's.  And he was not and sad to say is not, the only gay, or rumored-to-be-gay athlete that General Mills has passed on.<br/>        Injustice though it might be, there are greater ones that have happened in our sports-obsessed culture.

1268
Propaganda. Really, hearts are kind of broken over not being on the front of a Wheaties box? Wheaties extortion trumps same sex marriage cake. Did he personally see to it that the front edge of the board was cleaned and disinfected?

1269
You think black people won’t vote for trump? Who is hurt the most by illegals taking their jobs? Black people/blue collar/low wage AMERICAN workers. Legal immigrants and high school graduates too. Black workers were just starting to get a leg up in the jobs market before the illegal tsunami. Moving into the trades. We owe the illegals zilch. We owe our own AMERICANS first. 45 million AMERICANS below the poverty line and we’re importing poverty????<br/>Anti-illegals=racists? No, pro-illegals are the racists. 

1270
"Mr. Trump has built a broad, demographically and ideologically diverse coalition, constructed around personality, not substance..."<br/>This sums up perfectly his appeal to a certain segment of the population.  Personality trumps (pun intended) substance in many areas of our culture  - think of reality television stars and the popularity of shows dependent entirely on personality with people lacking any identifiable talent.  Why wouldn't a country that has made multimillionaires of Kardashians want Donald Trump for president?  They would have a reality television show to entertain them every day.

In his rise to power, Hitler trumped the communists on the left, and the monarchists and economic conservatives on the right.

For decades, the super-rich have planned, financed and executed a stealthy takeover of our government, and have succeeded, I suspect, beyond their wildest dreams. The 2016 election was to be the final push, with the Koch brothers reportedly raising some $840 million to take over the Senate and the White House.<br/><br/>Now along comes this buffoon, this upstart, stealing all the oxygen from the oligarchs, using all their careful preparation for his own ends. He would take over the government, not they. He would offer socialism for the masses, not the austerity they so clearly cherish. <br/><br/>If Trump, the trumper, can't be co-opted, then he has to go. The rich aren't playing an idle game; they're zealots playing for keeps. Whatever happens next may rudely wake us all.

So you must believe that Bernie Sanders is using 'appalling racism and simplistic pandering' as well.  Both Trump and Sanders believe many of our problems stem from immigration, both legal and illegal. <br/><br/> "What is fascinating is that though Sanders and Trump couldn't be more different culturally, their programs overlap a great deal. "What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy," Sanders recently explained. "Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that." Trump's immigration paper states that "real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first — not wealthy globe-trotting donors."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0818-goldberg-immigration-trump-sanders-20150818-column.html" title="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0818-goldberg-immigration-trump-sanders-20150818-column.html" target="_blank">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0818-goldberg-immigration-tru...</a>

"trump not some bloated ideologue"<br/><br/>It's touching how you can see him through a lover's eyes.

1275
Is "saying what you think" as a politician still valuable when "what you think" is a mash-up of arrogant self-promotion, cruel nativism, cocksure misogyny, and incoherent idiocy?  I'm all for honesty, but does it trump every other consideration?<br/><br/>And where, o where, are this man's specific policy proposals?  He's going to be "great" in many different areas, to hear him tell it.  But...how, exactly?<br/><br/>This whole thing is sad and mystifying.  And I can't tear myself away.

1276
This is extremely frightening.  It shows the electorate is uneducated and foolish.<br/>The people supporting Trump must be the very same people that elected Bush twice.  Will they take responsibility for their votes and perhaps vote for a man that is without a doubt, unqualified to be the POTUS?  <br/><br/>One of the reasons he is leading in the polls is that the other republican candidates are not much more qualified than he is.  Most of them are ignorant professional politicians and offer zero substance as trump offers.<br/><br/>What happened to the educated voter in this country - where are they?

1277
I'm trying hard to resist the idea that many Americans who support a candidate like Trump are ignorant and racist when it comes to how our government works, especially at its best. It's not a TV show, a golf course, a hotel, apartment building, or banquet hall. It's not a platform for someone who has no experience in bringing people together and understanding the Constitution, Bill of Rights or how to support infrastructure. I don't believe our elected officials are doing their best, I do believe they manipulate and have been manipulated by the media, but I am not presently fearful some adolescent meglomaniac will destroy any rapprochement here or abroad or believe being rich trumps any other quality. Maybe the simplest answer is that Trump is as bright as the people who follow him, and that's sad and scary for democracy.

Meredith,<br/><br/>I am a political scientist and writer.

Abortion is a matter of continued debate because it is morally and ethically ambiguous.  Science confronts us with a changing landscape of choices, issues of viability and the long-term lives of those fetuses that are viable that will eventually grow into citizens.  The reflexive position of prolifers that the fetus trumps all other considerations seems as an inhuman as the position that this matter is completely resolved in favor of absolute choice by exclusively the woman taken by pro-choice advocates.  Imagine a future state with the ability to take a few cells and an artificial womb and be certain of viability.  This already exists.  Parents that choose to use surrogates hand over the decision of termination to surrogate.  They have no rights.  This issue is profoundly human and it is too easy to dismiss concerns by people on both sides as irrational and amoral. 

1281
I guess outrageous, inflammatory behavior -- and even hairstyle -- trump (pardon the pun) serious coverage of a pragmatic and insightful candidate's observations.  How sad to see this in the New York Times....

Btw, I had never "seen" DFW (just read some essays by him) before I saw the film. I went to YouTube to catch a sense of the guy and compare to Segel's portrayal. I think I liked the portrayal better than the actual guy (as per interviews in You Tube). They are different, yes. Seagull's version seemed to have more wrinkles. The original version seems so insecure, so self-conscious, so intent on looking brilliant that it hurts. Siegel seemed more in touch with himself. Now, the version that should really trump all others is the written voice of his work. It was a real spoiler to see the "man" behind it. I do not care for the malaise of "America" that he portrays and would never read 1,000 pages of that stuff, even if it is a critical voice, which I am not sure it is, but he is an important voice of his generation, for better or worse.

No we shouldn't be arguing over whose persecution is worse because in the American context and I'd argue the Western one as well whiteness trumps all. So to argue that blacks had it easy in a world that's seen apartheid, the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow, colonialism and so on is exactly the sort of overheated facile rhetoric that turns off possible allies.

If "a good New York slice trumps every kind of pizza" then why doesn't Lucali sell them?  No doubt the food at this restaurant is very good BUT I can't help but detect a sort of pretentiousness to the "lack of pretention".

The Donald Trump clothing line is made in China.  Why would anyone believe that he's going to help American workers?<br/><br/><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-admits-gear-made-china-labels/story?id=13472355" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-admits-gear-made-china-labels/story?id=13472355" target="_blank">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-admits-gear-made-china-label...</a>

Conflating "terrorism with Islam" is one thing; being in full denial for the sake of Political Correctness is another. Traditional, historic European Leftist/Anarchist or Far Right terrorism hasn't occurred in these countries for years. The current terrorist threat is undeniably linked to Islam, or an interpretation of it if you'd prefer. <br/><br/>The fact that you seem to be willing to dismiss facts for the sole purpose of avoiding any common ground with bigots seems, to me, the height of ideology trumping reality. 

1288
I would like to point out for Mr. Douthat, and especially in the context of a discussion that includes Scott Walker and the topic of undocumented people in the United States, that Walker has associated himself with the same radical nonsense that Trump has been trumpeting. Last week Iowa radio talk show host Jan Mickelson made a serious suggestion that the Iowa enslave the population of undocumented workers. This was not a misquote. He didn't walk it back. He doubled-down. Walker was a guest on this lunatic's show after he made the comments. After. Now of course, Mickelson's deranged comments didn't come up in the conversation with Walker, but the fact that Walker did show up as a guest after those comments were made makes Walker a morally abhorrent figure in today's politics with no business getting anywhere near the White House. Your inclusion, Mr. Douthat - of Walker as a serious contender in the discussion around the race for the Presidency is becoming laughable. 

1289
If I remember correctly the assertion was that we use no more than 10 percent of our brain's capacity at any one time. Trust the media, though, to trumpet a catchy but inaccurate slogan (I too saw the claim you suggest, many a time) until it erases the real truth from the memory of anyone who actually read the information.

1290
unfortunately, a number of the responses here use analogies or metaphors that could be examples of abnormal psychology, or at least beliefs trumping reason/logic/evidence, that emotional part of the brain that believes what it wants to believe, what they say about the current hardware (brain) being the same as what we had 75-100 thousand years ago, but the technology we've created much more advanced, yes people seem very uninterested in psychology ...

At Trump's Alabama rally the other day his supporters were caught on camera yelling "White Power".<br/><br/><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/08/22/video_trump_supporter_yells_out_white_power_during_alabama_rally.html" title="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/08/22/video_trump_supporter_yells_out_white_power_during_alabama_rally.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/08/22/video_trump_supporter_...</a><br/><br/>And the other day two Boston men cited him in their brutal attack on a Hispanic homeless man.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/08/20/donald_trump_boston_immigrant_attack_beaten_homeless_hispanic_man_should.html" title="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/08/20/donald_trump_boston_immigrant_attack_beaten_homeless_hispanic_man_should.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/08/20/donald_trump_boston_im...</a><br/><br/>This is the republican/tea party, unmasked. A collection of retrograde racists and bigots that have been hoodwinked by the party elite for the last 40 years, and over the last six have realized that they actually have the power to control their party. Trump. a man who fell into wealth but has no discernible talents besides being a complete jerk, is their perfect leader. He represents the disaffected whites of the party, who following in the proud American tradition, would rather complain about people with different color skin than actually work or educate themselves. 

1292
Only one problem: "subject to the jurisdiction" means just that: one is bound by the laws, and can be tried by American courts for breaking them. That's what jurisdiction IS, "law-saying". It's a major issue in pre-modern European law, where jurisdiction really did follow persons, not places: a great deal of pre-1800 litigation in Europe, especially on civil matters, had to do with which court was competent (had jurisdiction) to render a judgment. The result of 'jurisdiction by person' was legal gridlock, in many cases, and was eventually overcome by the establishment of universal national jurisdictions (which built the universal but secondary jurisdiction of the Emperor in the Empire by allowing it to trump local, feudal, and clerical jurisdictions.) By the way, one term for jurisdiction-by-person is "privilege"; and in England, that term was called a "freedom" or "liberty", as in, "citizens of York enjoy the freedom of answering only to the court His Majesty has established at York.<br/><br/>Do we really want to go back to the feudal system (or perhaps we already are?)

1293
I like Corvino but his essay here is unhelpful.  First, he seems to misunderstand the legal arguments of public accommodation laws.  One cannot sue a photographer for not shooting a child's birthday party if that photographer doesn't shoot ANY children's birthday parties.  It's different if that photographer doesn't shoot a particular child's birthday because of race, disability, or sexual orientation of that child's parents.  This example seems to be a senseless, irrelevant distraction.  Second, out of all the questions he asked he didn't ask the one that could be the most helpful which is why is racism the "trump card"?    Why is allowing for a discussion and debate over tolerance of homophobia okay when he seems to believe that the same discussion over tolerance of racism shouldn't be considered?  I don't think that anyone's suggestion that homophobia and racism share the same prevelance or seriousness as a cultural issue, but that doesn't mean that the two don't intersect.  Corvino seems to insist that we should understand discrimination from the point of view of intention which would necessarily place consideration of the oppressor before the oppressed.  Giving even more advantage and control to those who would oppress will only serve to increase discrimination of all kinds.

1294
The intent of the law cannot trump its plain language.  We frequently cannot trace the intent behind laws, much less provisions of the Constitution.  If we had to rely on intent to interpret the legal code of this country, we would frequently be left in the dark.  <br/><br/>Also, another commenter quoted an exchange in Congress over the proposed amendment dealing with the citizenship of native-born babies of Chinese citizens.  A supporter of the amendment asserted that such babies would in fact be American citizens.  While the main purpose of the amendment clearly was to guarantee citizenship to former slaves, some supporters at the time recognized that that would not be its only application.

People of a certain age (fill in the blank) should not be in stocks or at least individual stocks. They should be in markets, a.k.a. low-cost, market mirrors, and they should be well diversified in a variety of markets, including cash and bonds, and they should regularly (fill in the blank) rebalance their holdings. Then as they grow even older (fill in, etc.) they should annuitize most or all of their holdings unless they are either too rich or too poor. At a certain age (fill in, etc.) longevity risks trumps market risk. If you can't make all the money you want, love the money you've got. You don't need to make money, you need to keep the money you have and make sure you can pay your bills for as long as you both shall live. 

1296
Thanks. I'm tired of the Times and other media acting as if single and childless people do not exist.  The needs and wants of parents don't trump those of other employees; perks and benefits should be equitably distributed.

1297
A relatively mild attempt to smear Mr. Kasich for his association with Lehman. Note, if Kasich had in fact been involved with issuing CMO's of other mortgage packed obligations the Times would surely have played this up big.  Kasich is a Republican moderate and there are too few of them. Unfortunately, intelligent and capable Republicans are being ignored by the vast unwashed legion of disaffected white males who flock to the "trumpet" call of demagogues.

1298
Unfortunately, all of our slurs on the republicans  ... "vast unwashed legion of disaffected white males who flock to the "trumpet" call of demagogues" apply directly to the progressives who are flocking to Sanders. We have no credible candidate this year. 

1299
Finally a correction in what Mr. Krugman accurately depicts "...what happens when too much money is chasing too few investment opportunities..."<br/><br/>The Market simply reflects this malignant outgrowth of corporate capitalism, where money trumps morality and consequences of immoral investing carries no liability.<br/><br/>Despite these recent gyrations, the Health industry still thrives and Drug Mfrs are  on top today.<br/>Imagine a society that allows many to rake in dividends and capital gains from Drug Mfrs, while others cannot afford the cost of their prescriptions.<br/><br/><a href="https://biz.yahoo.com/p/5mktd.html" title="https://biz.yahoo.com/p/5mktd.html" target="_blank">https://biz.yahoo.com/p/5mktd.html</a>

"This simply bewilders statists. They tend to unpack the same categorical error - 'but racism is wrong!'"<br/><br/>No, Maire, it is you who is making a categorical error.  One may believe or not believe that "racism is wrong" but the law is not concerned with abstract philosophical thinking, but with the actual effects that the conclusions may have on the real live human beings who make up a society. Libertarians tend to think that individual freedom trumps all other considerations while others of us want to know what impact the worship of individual liberty has on the life of other people. Is curtailing the freedom of a business owner to pick and choose his customers based on criteria such as race worse than curtailing the freedom of a black person to obtain food and water in the same way that any white person can do? And if it is worse, why is it worse? Does being forced to NOT exclude someone from public accommodations--which is what private businesses actually are in spite of the name--have more of a negative impact on someone's life and well-being than do the consequences of being excluded from a lunch counter, a hotel, and, yes, a swimming pool? In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to ask these questions. The problem is that libertarians seem incapable of acknowledging that their ideal of absolute freedom for THEM means the loss of a great deal of freedom for others because the reality is that this is not a perfect world.

1301
I see that this seventh time we've posted the same link, we're still deliberately distorting its "main thrust," and trying to skip lightly past its flat-put contradictions of our pet conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>First, the article's "main thrust," is that there're been a reformulation of warming models based on better data, and a better understanding of how the planet warms and cools. <br/><br/>Second, the article shows that despite the loud, loud screeching from the nutbar brigade, Trenbearth et al are doing pretty much exactly what scientists are spozed to do. i do adore, though, the way that the denier crowd "argues," for conspiracy and concealment and distortion based on the data, the work, and the projections of the people who are spozed to be doing the conspiracy, the concealment and the distortion.<br/><br/>Third: we prolly have a big El Nino coming up. I suggest actually reading the article you're trumpeting about, Kurts, and noticing what happens when all that warm water "sloshes back." 

1302
Go gettem trump....speak your mind. You are saying nothing less than most of us americans think but cant say due to PC relations and the too liberal press on racial relations. Keep the politicians on their toes and offf balance. 

1303
We want to learn how the law operates.<br/>Why do you want only rich people to practice law, anyway?<br/><br/>Post 9-11, we ought to have trained lawyers on every block!<br/>(Despite what the NYT might tell you as they sell thousand dollar watches and fancy expensive shoes:  sometimes knowledge is worth more than $$$.  Sometimes what you know can save your life, or get you out of a conviction or jail.  LIkely not an arrest though, because you don't want to debate the facts of law on the street with cops.  Save it for the courtrooms.)<br/><br/>The point is, not all of us have fathers who are going to welcome us into the newspaper business, or their small-town law practices.  What we know will serve us much much better than simply going to school to make connections before we inherit our father or grandfather's business to run.<br/><br/>Again, I wonder why the NYT would be encouraging LESS people study the law, when looking at the street protests today, it should be just the opposite.  Get some of those people into seats at the law school, alongside the sons of the wealthy.  WE can compete with you on our skills and merits.  You might have a job waiting to comfort your life and bring you thousands of dollars annually;  the rest of us want to ply our trade honestly and practice independence as we work our way up.<br/><br/>I think the work of the independent ones will trump the inherited sons anyday.  Give us a call when you need someone to negotiate the sale of the Times for you?

1304
President Carter was the last truly great President. We've had Bufoons in the White House since him, indeed, especially that one from Texas that trumped up a war. <br/><br/>He was overthrown by the oligarchs, puppet Regan's Kitchen Cabinet, by filthy lucre. We'd be in a much worse mess but for President Carter's efforts, which are clearly expressed in the article, which one should be read before commenting.

1305
People try to deny the impact of competing with test scores, grades and extra-curriculars when a minority with a good tale to tell can trump your work, your jobs, your grades and scores because of their skin color, or gender.<br/><br/>Then, many of these a.a. admits cannot pass the bar exam or find work, unless they are a showpiece at an all-white firm, like the author here from Wilmette! practiced in.

1306
The Republicans refuse to learn from history, including the history of their own Party.  They began as the party of change, the chief 19th political advocate of abolitionism and incubator of the progressive movement in the 1890s and early 20th-century, culminating in Teddy Roosevelt's presidency.  Soon, however, they etreated into the pro-business, anti-populist, uber-Capitalism that precipitated the Great Depression, cultivatingthe most reactionary, isolationist, paranoid, authoritarian elements in American society.  Global capitalism may be the ideology of those with high-net worth, but the Republicans bread-and-butter are the least educated, most suspicious and jingoistic American voters- a constituency that, ironically, would in the 19th-century most likely have opposed abolition.<br/><br/>The Republicans  who have united with Netanyahu in trying to destroy the Iran pact have done so, I think, in the mistaken belief that an alliance that includes our European allies and Russia and China, and opens Iran for global trade, somehow weakens the U.S. both politically and economically.  In fact, the reverse is true: new markets, and international cooperation, increases opportunities for all. <br/><br/>Aggressive, greedy, ignorant and xenophobic, Republicans always miss the obvious:  friends are better than enemies, even if those friends don't look like you, or share your world view.  Butter trumps guns. It's sad that, re Iran, some Democrats have signed on to the right's failed ideas.

NYTimes, stop calling these people refugees.  You say migrants in your title, but refugees throughout the article.  <br/><br/>These are not people who embrace the western culture.  Who have a desire to assimilate and bring their skills to a new country.  These are opportunists.  While I don't blame their effort to go to a wealthier country where they will receive welfare through food, housing, and education (if they allow their girls the later I'll be surprised).  <br/><br/>The other issue is religion.  I have no problem with people practicing their religion, but state laws trump religious rights.  To demand that pictures be removed, that women cover their heads and are allowed to hide their face for ID pictures, etc. is a joke.  And the murder of an adulterer is not acceptable in the west.  One thing to demand tolerance, quite another to demand adherence.  <br/><br/>Lastly, shame on those demanding Europe take in these illegal immigrants.  Europe cannot take care of its own people, there are not enough jobs, not enough money, and certainly not enough tax revenue.  The plight of these people is sad, but it's not Europe's responsibility.  And don't take me back 1000 years and find some story that says it is.  It is 2015, and it's time for the people in the middle east to get it together.  Stop having kids, allow women to be educated, and start respecting the other guys tribe.

25 percent of hiv pos also have hepC. They will all mostly have a wide range of other current STI infections or have been Rx for ones in the past.<br/><br/>This is the price of freedom. This is the price of knowing that BB is the way to go and condoms are so what you used before a daily Rx for hiv became available.<br/><br/>As a public health man that lost every gay male friend he had in the 1980 from early 1980s to early 2000. All dead and gone all from HIV. <br/><br/>Treatment is so important and should never ever be withheld if we have it to offer and it makes good sense.<br/><br/>But I do understand why so many are flocking to trump. Many Americans would see this destructive expensive preventable cycle repeat again and again and be disgusted.<br/><br/>Many Americans don't want to see $1000 a pill to treat a generation  for conditions that are so easily prevented.<br/><br/>It's a problem for sure.<br/><br/>And if anyone is going to tell us that straights get STIs and HIV and hep b and hep c and syphilis just like MSM do they need to look at the CDC data first.<br/><br/>The CDC data tells a completely different story.<br/><br/>We could stop the cycle of disease we choose not to

Jimmy Carter made a far better EX-President.  And to trumpet airline deregulation as one of his "accomplishments" is a joke.

I know this was probably not the NYT's intention, but I think this video and the comments by these artists only shows how shallow and derivative this music is. I think Skrillex's last line is the most telling. He actually thinks the fact that so many people think computer musicians are talentless is a sign it will ENDURE? Meanwhile there's a kid somewhere in New Orleans blowing all the pain and suffering he has endured into a trumpet -- not into a computer. That kid is making music that moves people and stands the test of time. That's why people still listen to Miles Davis, Johnny Cash, Jimi Hendrix, Roberta Flack, Parliament/Funkadelic, Led Zeppelin, X, Nirvana, etc. They endure because WHAT they were saying musically was as important as HOW they said it.  And I'm not knocking technology. Lots of artists have used it to make interesting music, but the acts that have used synthetic music and endured always used it as a tool to back more substantive songwriting, vocalizing and instrumentation. The fact that Skrillex and Diplo have to attach themselves to whatever vapid pop sensation is happening at the moment in order to stay relevant says a lot. Is it trendy? Yes. Will it sell? Of course. Will it endure? Nope … not even in tomorrow's dance clubs.  Will somebody be listening to that kid playing his trumpet and thinking he's awesome? Probably. 

1313
The fact that trump is a serious candidate unfortunately proves that a large segment of the populous is unqualified to take part in the democratic process.

Sure, 10 years ago many markets also jumped to $160k per year salaries, trumpeted by schools and the ABA in brochures.  Get aboard the cruise ship, once there, pay no attention to the overflowing toilets.

And when they cross multiple borders to get to U.S. soil, what credible claim can they make for asylum?  They are what they always have been- economic migrants, looking for a better life.  I see mayor Deblasio has turned NewYork into a virtual sanctuary city, and the courts there are being overwhelmed by the lawyers trumping up these asylum claims.

1316
Ideology trumps reality once again, for the fail!

1317
The popularity of Donald trump can understand. Democrats are unable to justify the trust they had a society.  This is why citizens of the United States decided to find a fresh perspective on what is happening in the country and the world. Trump as no one else fits that description.

As counties go, Queens will never trump Kings.

Honestly, the real answer for Vegas, Baby! is for the parents of the children who live in poverty to leave Las Vegas. The job market here is beyond grim (ignore the official NV employment stats; they include part-time and "on-call" workers, the majority of all hospitality workers, as being fully employed), and has been since the Summer of 2008. Parents are forced to juggle multiple jobs, because 28 hours or less of employment per week at $8/hr ("MORE than minimum wage!", the employers trumpet) does not a living make. It's the glut of workers just hanging around, waiting for the next boom and taking whatever work they can find, if they're lucky, in the interim, that allows the employers to get away with this punitive employment strategy. And it is the actions of both the employers and the parents that jeopardize the futures of these children.<br/><br/>Where will they go? I don't know. Maybe back to SoCal, where most of them came from in the first place. But considering this local economy, practically anywhere else in the nation must have a better job market than Las Vegas. A double-digit reduction in the percentage of poverty-stricken children in the school district could go a long way toward making a voucher system more equitable in Las Vegas. But in our ragged economy as it is, school vouchers could very well be just one more thing that the desperate and/or greedy can buy, sell, or barter in an attempt to survive Sin City. And that wouldn't do the children any good at all.

1320
How dare Jeb Bush fail to adhere to the politically correct dialectic of the New York Times Editorial Board. That certain groups and situations cannot be referred to directly is the moral principle of political correctness and the reason why "baloney" rhetoric trumps serious issues and candidates in the next campaign for President.

1321
Very interesting to see the NYTimes giving Jeb Bush advice on the hopes he becomes the Republican candidate. The liberal media establishment had its heart set on Bush running; it was likely the only way Hillary was going to win. Now that Trump has trumped all the Republican candidates, the NYTimes desperately wants to boost Bush in any way possible. The people love to see the establishment squirm.

1322
Trump is a malignant narcissist who is dogmatic, reactionary and very brittle when challenged. He functions emotionally as a spoiled 2 yo but that is insulting to toddlers. Though the rule, " You can't have a tantrum without an audience,"  still applies.<br/>He is the Id of today's GOP and he would be properly relegated to the entertainment and gossip sections if not for  The doldrums of August.<br/>Corporate media needs attention they need to sell revenue so no corporate media needs attention they need to  willing fools to turn on the TV and so they amplify trumps hateful rhetoric 24/7.<br/>Stop watching, stop listening and giving him the attention.

Right wing talk show hosts are getting what they deserve They continue to put molifying their audiences above attempting to show Trump up to be what he is a bully and a strongman more like benito mussolini than ronald reagan There is a facebook post that relates a story about a Trump building where at the end of construction he refused to pay many of his subs and in addition told them that just workjng on a Trump project was payment enough and if they couldnt figure out how to parley that into big bucks they were stupid If true does that sound like someone concerned for the little guy ? the problem here is that voters arent seeing the real Trump they are seeing the reality show atrump

The best analyst of the Trump phenomenon by far continues to be Scott Adams (yes, the cartoonist). As Adams points out in his recent blog post, the metaphor underlying yesterday's press conference was so perfect it's hard to believe it wasn't scripted. Trump throws out the Mexican reporter who refuses to follow the rules, then lets him back in after he agrees to follow the rules and treats him just like the other reporters: <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127604348746/trump-makes-univision-do-the-perp-walk" title="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127604348746/trump-makes-univision-do-the-perp-walk" target="_blank">http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127604348746/trump-makes-univision-do-the-p...</a>

You're spot on, PB!  My late mother was a fundamentalist, faded Southern belle.  When the film with Burt Lancaster came out, I was in high school, and, like my friends wanted to see it.  And the sweet and demur Shirley Jones was also in it.  My mother tried to prevent my going.  She said Sinclair Lewis was a communist and Elmer Gantry a "trumped-up" rake.  Well, bless her heart, she got the trumped-up part right long before the Donald became infamous.  I saw it and Ms. Jones' portrayal of a "working girl."  

1327
I think the dems and left leaning  people dismiss trump's immigration views at their own peril. average americans are very weary of this, not just right wing nuts.

1328
this is an interesting perspective on how the voting history of the survey respondents might influence actual results.  but why give us the point estimate for trump's performance in this poll if the point is to say that it is lower than in other polls?  if you give us the sample error, at least we can understand which differences are statistically significant. this is important because the author is saying: "there is evidence."  we need to assess how strong that evidence is.  

1329
i love watching the media squirm when trump speaks...

1330
It's comical watching columnists try to dismiss or defeat Trump through self righteous assertions of his degenerate behavior.<br/><br/>Liberals are squirming in their ivory towers at a loss of how to out trump Trump.<br/><br/>He's gathering up handfuls of political correctness and throwing it back in the faces of a nation of hypocrites.<br/><br/>Deal with it!

1331
You don't judge trump  by what he says--it's nothing. Take a look at what he's done, e.g hiring undocumented workers. You know, the rapists and criminals that Mexico is sending us. That's only a small part of his record. Try validating every statement that he's made and is making.  Check out his business policies (including the health care policy benefits) as he applied them with people who have worked for him at every level. Then write a blog.

Have no Republicans read this article? <a href="http://www.nationalmemo.com/21-questions-for-donald-trump/" title="http://www.nationalmemo.com/21-questions-for-donald-trump/" target="_blank">http://www.nationalmemo.com/21-questions-for-donald-trump/</a><br/><br/>If they have, why don't they use it?<br/><br/>Among the interesting pieces of information is Trump’s hiring of illegal aliens (Polish) for a construction job (without providing them hard hats) and his connections with mob bosses.<br/><br/>I’m sure there’s a good deal more dirt on him to be dug up as well.<br/><br/>I happen to be a Democrat, but I have despised Donald Trump for many years and hate watching what he is doing to our presidential election.<br/><br/>By the way, I don’t understand why John Kasich is being lumped in with the other loser Republican candidates. He really scares me as a possible Republican nominee.

1333
trump is the distillation pf gop culture.  all the "impurities" like honesty, patriotism, and dignity boiled away to expose the shining heart of everything for which they have worked.     if youre surprised- you havent been paying attention.<br/><br/>In 1980 I accidentally tuned in to Reagan's announcement that he was running for president.  I said to myself "who the heck is going to vote for this clown?" the answer of course was "other clowns"

1334
A paramount difference between Donald Trump and President Carter is that President Carter lives and demonstrates his faith in his actions on a daily basis where as Donald Trump does just that - trumps and yaps hurtful words all day long that are as hollow as his head and heart.  He's more no a Christian than I am Mother Teresa.

1335
What's known about trumps ancestors?  How and where did they get in?

1336
Sorry, you have it very wrong. The rights of the unborn trump any argument the choice group can invent. Roe vs Wade will eventually be overturned and I can't wait for that to happen. It's easy for you to blame all the casualties of war on the republicans. Try Obama's drone war for starters as so many innocent civilians r being killed. For dessert try the Viet nam war started by u libs. Finally, for the black lives matter crowd try rationalizing the killing of 10 million black babies since 1973.

Wishful thinking, trumpeting differences that fall within the margin of sampling uncertainty, no in-depth explanation of exactly how the Civis poll works.<br/>Not up to the NY TImes standard at all and I suggest rewriting this article.

As a woman, I find your "answers" not only lacking in meat, they are ickily removed from a woman's experience and perspective. And while I respect your opinion in explaining why abortion is wrong for you, the fact remains that my faith doesn't give me that perspective.  The purely secular answer is for Choice.  There IS no secular reason to deny abortion rights to women, and last I looked this is a secular and free country. Your religion simply does not trump mine.  I'm baffled beyond belief that this is still an issue.  Lets hear more about the types of support that enable women to bear children without fear and dread because that's what this is all really about.

I don't believe that Donald Trump polls are overstated. I have spoken with many young people twenty something and 30 something who usually vote Democrats. To my great surprise there were supporting Donald trump on issues of trade with China and immigration. I am a liberal Democrat and on these two issues I will also vote for Donald Trump, no matter how crazy the press and the Hispanics portray him. He had the guts to put forth what everybody was thinking about and never dared to mention because they are pressured to be politically correct. He didn't take the oxygen out of the Republican Party, because there was no oxygen to begin with.

1340
Doesn't the Constitution guarantee our right to freedom of assembly without being massacred?  Why does the Second Amendment always get to trump the First? 

1341
trump's movement does actually appear motivated by things other than trump's own personal beliefs. i've been listening to him closely and he appears more on the democrat side of the ledger on many issues. immigration is his linchpin and stirs his followers up. he's fun to watch when he spits in the political and media establishment's eye but his endless boasting suggests a very insecure and dysfunctional person. the gop's "deep bench" all look unelectable.

1342
China is still run by corrupt bureaucrats who are lethal towards their subjects in so many ways.  The few who protest are asking for death.  We should not be doing any business with China and should bring the jobs home.  Capitalism trumps (pardon my verb choice) decency and sensibility.<br/><br/>Jane Taras Carlson

poor = poor judgement, emotion trumping rationality.

Too many polls. When you poll incessantly, it seems less impressive. <br/><br/>What interests me far more is the increasingly well documented links between Trumps meteoric rise in popularity as measured by campaign event turnout and white supremacy groups. I suspect for many, trump oddly provides "cover" for blatantly racist views. Because he doesn't come right out and attack groups beyond illegal immigrants, folks are free to extrapolate what they will regarding any minority groups, including African Americans.<br/><br/>Trump can claim any level of support he chooses. He's so adept at exaggerating, who can say whether or not he has some hidden information we don't have.

1345
Vlad-Drakul, <br/><br/>The founders of this country were deeply concerned with the maintenance of civic virtue and they did not believe that an uncultivated populace was capable of republican self-government.  <br/><br/>I am not saying that trump supporters should be deprived of the vote.  I am saying that the raw material of democracy--the demos--is in sharp decline just as the elite of democracy--leaders and cheaters like Rove-Bush and bone-heads like Trump--is in sharp decline. <br/><br/>Democracy is hobbled and needs to be restored.  Acting like the raw material and elite of this country are adequate for a well functioning democracy is nothing but complacency, an if it aint broke don't fix it mentality. 

1346
Democratic power is sort of vague and opaque and becoming more so all the time. Nothing vague about a gun. Also, capital trumps labor - another way of saying that property is ascendant over people. The individual is sovereign, while society is suspect. A gun in the hand is the ultimate expression of our values and the proof is in the pudding. To change this truth will take something akin to the passion and intensity represented my our murder rate.

1347
Michael Barbaro's description of the event bears little resemblance to the actual press conference.  Of course, not to be outdone, George Stephanopoulos broadcast on ABC World News a series of reshuffled video clips purporting to show Trump waving to his security team to get rid of Ramos, and then shaking his head (00:14 on the video):<br/><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jorge-ramos-donald-trump-absolutely-gave-order-eject/story?id=33325669" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jorge-ramos-donald-trump-absolutely-gave-order-eject/story?id=33325669" target="_blank">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jorge-ramos-donald-trump-absolutely-gave-...</a><br/><br/>Only, that is not what happened, as you can see on CNN:<br/><a href="http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2015/08/25/donald-trump-jorge-ramos-press-conferece-full.cnnmoney/index.html" title="http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2015/08/25/donald-trump-jorge-ramos-press-conferece-full.cnnmoney/index.html" target="_blank">http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2015/08/25/donald-trump-jorge-ramos-pres...</a><br/><br/>Neither Barbaro nor Stephanopoulos feel an obligation to present the news acurately.  How shallow.

After Ramos was thrown out, a xenophobic Trump supporter was caught on camera telling the Univision reporter to "get out of my country". I'm dismayed to see that the incident hasn't seemed to hurt the Trump campaign at all.<br/><br/><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2015/08/26/3695602/trump-supporter-jorge-ramos/" title="http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2015/08/26/3695602/trump-supporter-jorge-ramos/" target="_blank">http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2015/08/26/3695602/trump-supporter-...</a>

Trump sells, it is that stupid.  The throng of frightened white people are joining him.  And thing throng isn't just the rightwing extremist.  The danger in not reporting on trump is that his vile persona will sit outside of public view.  For every new Trumpster there are three horrified voters.  Covering that press conference was way to much.<br/>Its kind of like sex education.  At the very least we should be teaching the mechanics in our science classes as a way of dispelling and correcting myths.  So too should we receive a purely cut and dry list of the mechanics of Trump.<br/>There was a guy in my town who was always writing the local newspaper complaining about the city council.  He decides to run for mayor.  He didn't have to do much.  He owned a bait shop/gas station/convenience store and his bumper stickers played across most cars.<br/>So he won.  Then he stopped showing up.  The issues before the council could not be answered by a snappy comment and the threat of doing nothing rather than always getting his way.<br/>Trump as prezzz?<br/>Terrifying. 

1350
He went out of turn--whatever that means at a press conference--but did not jump around and did not shout. It is not a good sign that atrump's supporters are this disconnected from reality. 

1351
For years we have been told rape is a crime of violence not sex and yet this article states:  the idea that rape necessarily includes force has persisted — even though it is “woefully out of step with modern conceptions of sex."  <br/><br/>The definition of violence is  "behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something."<br/><br/>So if rape really is a crime of violence the bar most states have set to prove rape seems correct. Now this particular case does not seem to involve intentional violence but it does involve none-consensual sex. That is, once a point in the interaction had been reached. Prior to that point, it seemed it was consensual. <br/><br/>To REALLY stop incidents like St. Paul happening, it's time we did a better job of scientifically understanding the role of hormones in the teenage male once a certain point has been reached in a sexual liaison in the same way we understand crimes of passion and temporary insanity as instances where reason goes out the window and is replaced by instinct.<br/><br/>Once we understand that better we can teach our boys to know the signs and our girls to avoid certain situations where the potential for instinct to trump reason can be avoided -- like avoiding deserted roofs at night and starting foreplay in a mechanical closet.  This is not to blame the victim but to focus on reducing the high number of sexual assaults that are an unfortunate reality. This case is a tragedy for both young people at the start of their lives.

1352
Actually, Ramos was not jumping the line.  Trump was basically going to ignore for the entire Press Conference.  Ramos got fed up with Trump avoiding answering his questions for the past several weeks.<br/><br/>See:  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/jorge-ramos-clearly-mr-trumps-problem-is-with-latinos/" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/jorge-ramos-clearly-mr-trumps-problem-is-with-latinos/" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/jorge-ramos-cle...</a>

1353
trump is a creature of the media which has not done it's real job in decades.  Cover the tripe because it's easy.  You don't have to think or know anything.

1354
Ramos is right.  From Trump we hear about what he will do--he will scrap Obamacare, he will build a fence and make Mexico pay for it, he will make anchor babies illegal, he will put China in its place, he will uproot ISIS by bombing the Iraqi oil fields that sustain ISIS financially, he will get rid of the illegal immigrants, he will give Iran a run for its money, he won't negotiate with Iran and he will scrap the Iran nuclear deal too.  He will make America great again.  The demagoguery is deafening.  He plays to the lowest common denominator in the American populace, to the xenophobes and the fearmongers, to the illiterate and the ill humored, the racists and the disaffected, he brings false hope that the clock can be turned back and American hegemony will return in full force and with it American hubris.  This is what his followers want--scapegoats-- and Trump can trump up the scapegoats one a second.  He doesn't frighten me as much as his American followers do.  Can they not see that until now he has told us what he will do--all delusions of grandeur--but he has not told us how he will do these things.  That is what Ramos was asking.  But Trump doesn't want to be asked how he will change what is already in existence and how he will implement his new and "valorous" proposals.  That is because he doesn't know how he'll do anything, but the demagogue wants us to believe because he says so it IS.  

1355
In terms of buying property abroad, there's a little more to it than that. It has been explained to me that buying property in China is essentially buying a long-term lease from the government.  At some point -- I think seventy years down the road -- title is open to review.  Whereas buying overseas gets the family an asset that stays in the family.  It was explained to me that if real estate prices dropped Chinese real estate buyers overseas would _not_ necessarily bail, because stagnant or negative growth in the short term is trumped by the worth of a reliable family asset in the long term.

Human have always had to delude themselves about the unknown and the uncertain in order to maintain their will to move forward and survive.<br/><br/>In our time on the planet, understanding and knowledge are slowly, but surely replacing delusion with facts.     This necessarily undermines 'belief systems' and creates 'agida' in those who are dedicated and fully committed to preserving their chosen delusion.   Their commitment to belief engenders a 'skepticism' of facts.    It's only human but often worthy of war and destruction.<br/><br/>The fact revolution itself is a direct result of the human evolution that is driven by our endowments as a species.    it doesn't much matter where or how we got those endowments, the reality is that we've consistently used them and honed them to progress.<br/><br/>The fact that our progress is largely at the expense of other species and the planet itself is a newfound fact (and reality) that undermines the belief system of Republicans who somehow seem to believe that we're simply playing out nature's law of the 'survival of the fittest' (by their definition of fittest).<br/><br/>The reality is that we are learning that WE, ourselves are fully responsible and accountable for our destiny, and the 'free lunch' of "free markets" has unexpected costs and consequences that are highly negative to our long term survival.    <br/><br/>We may love the delusion that got us here, but we have got to live with the reality of the present.    Facts will continue to 'trump' beliefs.

Same old same old op-eds with the same old same old results - zero. Our culture of individualism and disdain for governmental regulation will trump (sorry for the pun) any policy effort to stop this madness.

The Sunni Muslim Turks in Turkey along with the Sunni Muslim Arab nation states and the Shia Muslim Persians in Iran all agree that the Sunni Muslim Kurds do not deserve nor need a nation state where they are a majority.  Both al Qaeda and ISIL and their affiliates are all Sunni Muslim Arab organizations. Ethnocentrism trumps sectarianism.<br/><br/>Iraq was carved out of three provinces of the former Ottoman Turk Empire by the British and French Empires. Saladin was a Kurd.

The media is not helping matters.  There should be a voluntary ban on reporting all future shootings, or at least identifying the shooter.  Social media should take down any postings immediately.  Right now, the second amendment trumps the first amendment.

I was never a big admirer of larry king, but this story is a feature. it's not 'news'....do you expect everything written to be of huge importance? and look at all the 'news' Donald trump is getting for being an idiot...

1362
I suspect that the real reason politicians don't want to do anything in regards to gun control is because the people that this would affect have guns and a small percentage of these people are violent.   There are numerous instances I have seen in the news of people showing up to political rallies with their weapon of choice.  This is to intimidate, nothing more.   When a majority supports something the political risk and lobbying argument is hollow.   What is not hollow is that there a millions of guns in this county and they are not all owned by people who see the the government as a benign entity.  My guess is a number of them are itching to be the "patriots" that "save" this country.  So lets call a spade a spade and admit that our politicians and all of us for that matter are prisoner to these people.  Frankly if I was in politics I would be scared of them  in a real way.  The NRA has not helped and I actually think they know this is their trump card.  They have not shied away from incitement when they find it necessary.  When an institution does this it provides validation to those that would choose violence.  The fact is folks that we will likely not pass meaningful gun control and avoid the violent consequences. You cannot wish this away.  We find ourselves in a real mess.  Getting out will not be pretty but its the reality we will need to eventually face. 

1363
The NYT did a great job marginalizing Hillary in 2008; the same continues in her attempt at winning POTUS in 2016.<br/><br/>All we hear is about Trump's excesses and Clinton's trumped-up email "problems".

1364
Her convenience trumped national security.

1365
Your point is well taken. But wouldn't you agree The Donald "trumps" them all (i.e., hands down he's the "Ugliest American")?

1366
I think it is very interesting that most just assume that I support Trump as a candidate. I do not. What I do support is Trump not calling on Ramos, because that is Trump's prerogative, as it is with any politician conducting a press conference. Obama, Clinton, etc. do it all the time. With 20 to 30 reporters at a news conference, do you think that all reporters get called on? The reference to Jeopardy was an attempt to be humorous, so lighten up. Ramos's question was really more of a statement than a question, and he hadn't been called on.  It is interesting to note that many media people agree that Ramos was out of line.<br/><a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9211679/jorge-ramos-donald-trump" title="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9211679/jorge-ramos-donald-trump" target="_blank">http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9211679/jorge-ramos-donald-trump</a>

I abhor the NRA and the sick gun culture in this country yet I also fail to see why background checks are so often touted as the solution, because unless someone has been locked up in a mental facility they would almost certainly pass a background check.  Would Adam Lanza's mother have failed a background check?  No.  Nor would this aggrieved ex-reporter simply because he had a history of workplace conflict and filing trumped-up lawsuits.   

1368
I'm just plain tired of the trumped up outrage coming from the right regarding Obama and the Clintons.    We lived through the W years.  An administration that lied us into a war in order to put more money in the coffers of Halliburton and Dick Cheney.  A war that cost many American soldier's life and limb.  A war that made us the most hated country in the world.   It's really hard to take all of the accusations against Hillary as anything but more mud.    They accused Hillary of murder.  Impeached Bill for a, well you know, and insisted Obama is not a US citizen.<br/>Regarding Bernie - I'm all for him.  But, I'm not going to discount Hillary over another ridiculous bugaboo.  All I can do is turn away in disgust from the dead horse they continue to beat.  Where are the jobs?  What's happening to our middle class?  Why is our infrastructure falling apart?  Why don't our leaders have a plan to counteract Global Warming? Why don't our leaders focus on what the future's going to be like in an economy where only a few have jobs and even fewer have money?  And why does anyone care what a pompous spoiled rich man with a horrible hairdo has to say about anything?   

1369
Any body think this is not innocent before proving guilty? The press has always hounded the Clintons and they've done much for the country. I think in the end this will be much ado about nothing. Whitewater, Foster, etc. The GOP is afraid of both Clintons in the white hose they are fueling this way beyond control.<br/>It is still way to early in the campaign to be rushing to max like trump. Build slowly. I like the Hillary is moving so far. 

1370
I have been a long-time supporter of Hillary Clinton, going back to her first run for the Presidency in 2008. I have often defended her abilities by claiming her time in the Senate and her husband's time as President taught her how ruthless, relentless and petty Republicans can be, and that she knows how to handle their attacks. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, her handling of this fiasco has shown none of that. "Tone deaf" are exactly the words I would use regarding not just her response, but her use of a private server in the first place. Given the trumped-up accusations she and Bill faced through the years (Whitewater, Benghazi), she should have known better. Her unwillingness to deal with the issue head-on since has made me question her fitness for the Presidency.<br/><br/>Sorry, Hillary, you're losing my confidence, and my vote.

1371
Yoga moves and wedding plans should not trump national security. That argument was absurd. You can't have my SOS server because  my yoga pics and wedding plans. This is about world security, not personal privacy. She sounded like a teen complaining to a prying parent who wanted to look at her laptop. 

1372
"“The campaign has been incredibly tone-deaf, not seeing this as a more serious issue." <br/><br/>*I* don't see this as a more serious issue, it just seems like a non-story fed to the media by GOP operatives and trumpeted by the New York Times out of some unspoken vendetta against Hillary Clinton. I'm still trying to understand what this is even supposed to be about. So she used an email server at her home and some agencies picked a retroactive fight with the State Department over the meaning of the word "classified", as if the government didn't stamp "classified" on every other sheet of paper that crawls across a desk. You can only insinuate for so long before you have to come up with something HRC actually did wrong that had negative fallout for the country as a whole. So far I'm not seeing it, and the reason I'm not seeing it is probably because you don't have it. Ergo, this is a manufactured controversy. 

1373
To understand the economics of the Republican candidates, one must grapple with the anthropology. Xenophobia trumps (pardon the pun) the economic argument in the minds of the voters. And so they yearn for an alpha male so that their tribe may impose dominance.

1374
He's catholic and they don't count as valid Christian's in the trump supporters.

1375
i agree with the loathesomness of trump. however, i must remark that 'hope your baby girl is ready for a good time' is not a threat of rape, and the line is nowhere near as clear as rosenthal asserts that it is. 

1376
tragic. this portends more success for european xenophobes. now does anyone not understand the source of "benito" trump's appeal? 

1377
I think religious differences trump humanity in the card game of life.  

1378
In certain Islamic views, and not just weird ones which ISIS makes up, dogma trumps conduct. <br/><br/>What kind of religion is the Islam of ISIS? How respectful of Allah is behavior lower than the beasts'? Where is the example of Allah the Merciful?

1379
The pope and trump have one thing in common. They both are antiabortion. The pope's policy as a reflection of the Catholic Church condemns women worldwide to unwanted births and in many incidents, esp in Latin America, death due to birth or botched illegal abortions. The pope does not count women of child bearing age in the calculus of "sanctity of life."

1380
That's a terrific analysis.  Thank you.  I've been struggling to figure out the nexus of class and "otherness" works here.<br/><br/>You'd think all working class, lower middle class, and poor people would be working together and have solidarity with each other.<br/><br/>Instead, it's precisely this class which has been bitterly split along race, gender, religious and even regional lines.<br/><br/>It's clear why the GOP would be exploiting these issues because it keeps rich white men in power.  <br/><br/>But why haven't the Democrats been able to reach out to white poor and working class people?  <br/><br/>Or - maybe it isn't the fault of the Democrats but rather that culture, race, and religion trump economic issues after all?  

1381
Before any discussion of Trump's opinion about economics, let's first put a widely believed fallacy to bed. Trump is not a self-made man, as many Americans seem to think. He benefited greatly from government policies/subsidies he claims to oppose in principal, and inherited an estimated $40-$200 million from his real estate tycoon father, a man who himself was a huge benefactor of U.S. government subsidies.<br/>One source of many:<br/><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_made_his_fortune%3A_inheritance_from_dad_and_the_government%27s_protection_mostly_did_the_trick" title="http://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_made_his_fortune%3A_inheritance_from_dad_and_the_government%27s_protection_mostly_did_the_trick" target="_blank">http://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_ma...</a>

1382
It is NOT easy to devote one's self for the remainder of our life to serving others. Jesus did not create a script for a popes, he taught us all how to overcome our weaknesses, and how to serve others better. <br/><br/>A rational person deduces that Trump's script for making money and getting attention is much easier. There's self-serving gain achieved in devoting your life to this cheap purpose.  But it's monopoly money, and spending it on frivolous comforts leaves one with no benefits. Trump for president is a silly idea. Since when is an old man with the attitude of a spoiled 10 yr old brat the best the country can do for Pres? Maybe he is a democrat?<br/><br/>For the citizens of the world who care about the well being and the future of others, Pope Francis' Christian world view trumps self-serving world views.

1383
Chutzpah...   <br/><br/>The ruling party and pm of Israel, have been the definition of insanity. They keep doing the same things -- relying on violence, being confiscatory and belligerent  -- and yet somehow they expect things to get better?!<br/><br/> (And, yikes, like Cuba before them, they are an island that can start a nuclear war. JFK was on Israel's case, too, you know.  Since his death, Israel, by CHEATING, has attained over 200 nukes (S. Hersh) and now they are apoplectic about Iran's stone age weapon development being retarded not as fast as they wish!) <br/><br/>Their CHUTZPAH, Our BILLIONS<br/><br/>I can understand that this insanity is a reaction to another insanity -- what Hitler and the world has done to them.  And I know that's been drummed into their heads since birth.<br/><br/>But a different story has been drummed into the head of the Palestinians whose land they have taken.  It’s an obvious lethal spiral -- but now enlightened Jews and Obama are, against big odds, trying to unwind it. Please.<br/><br/>And the paranoids want to blow the deal up.  I grew up loving a different Israel that I wanted to fight for. But this flips me.<br/><br/>Which is why I have happily sent small checks to progressive Jewish orgs like JVP, as I do for Bernie Sanders. And because their messages make so much more sense, I think both can defeat the big money Republican/Netanyahou bankers like Sheldon Adelson who are -- as we said in the sixties -- the problem, not the solution. <br/><br/>End game: Our Mazeltov trumps their Chutzpah.   

1384
Popes love Trump...just ask him. In fact, why bother, he'll be bragging something like that soon enough. I do wonder whether the winters will be warmer under a trump presidency. That's a whole lot of hot air he be blowing!

1385
Except that (with the possible exception of true Libertarians) it's not that simple. Republicans are against big government except for the military and police, and greater freedom except in matters of national security (even trumping freedom of information), reproduction and ... well, sex.

1386
Are we finally ready to admit that culture and politics are not mutually exclusive and often go hand in hand? I wish they weren't intertwined - what a novel situation that would be - but since the 1800's (at least) music, art and politics have been 'fellow travelers' with emperors, cardinals and governments using composers, painters and others to trumpet the superiority of their own culture while also using them to project that culture abroad for political gain. I don't fault the Israeli culture minister for her reaction because at the end of the day she is a politician and, well, what else would one expect from her? But she ought to realize how self-defeating it is for her to react in that way at the same time that the world is attempting to reconnect to the Iranian governmental establishment and remind them of their obligations (as a member of the community of nations) while simultaneously appealing to the Iran people to support a different path of their nation's largely indefensible and reprehensible geopolitical acts. While an orchestral concert is unlikely to bring peace to the Middle East, it certainly won't do any worse than anything previously attempted.

1387
I see no difference between the popular commenters here and Donald trump and his followers, all of you'll advocate for a welfare state while ensuring racial and cultural isolation. The real issue in the west is not capitalism vs socialism, it is loss of white privilege which is drawing outrage among the left as well as the right.

1388
sure, of course you're correct, but with the establishment press it's still all about money and status.  the press can't afford to appear asymmetrical--they'll lose republican readers, and they'll become identified as "partisan".<br/><br/>that's one reason the press, including sometimes the times, is betraying its audience.  but i wonder, just how absurd, how "off the wall", would the right have to get before the press would dare to accept "asymmetry".  <br/><br/>with trump and his followers, we may just find out.

1389
Talk about burying the lead! The fact that Caijing newspaper kept the story online while their reporter was "detained" (on a trumped up conspiracy of journalistic bear raids) shows us a new boldness and individuality in China, led by entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>After all the talk of "regime change" in the 1980's and 1990's in China, here we have real evidence of market-led opinion divergence in China, not caused by an invading army, drones or bombs, but by simple market evolution. It's not much of a "story" but compared to decades of sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and North Korea, it certainly makes a quiet point.     

1390
If you read the scientists' comments reported in the article you will realize this is not an issue for psychology or for social sciences generally but for all scientific inquiry. The message is not that scientific investigation is useless but that it is difficult and that replication and transparency which replication requires are essential. Some progress is being made in providing incentives for both, which were unfortunately missing previously in many fields. We also need science reporters and reporters more generally to be better educated consumers of science and not simply trumpet every "sexy" new idea however weak the evidence or questionable the approach.

1391
The Bush dynasty did indeed hit the Trump bump, but that's only because this Bush is more obviously inept than his brother, and we our experience with his brother is too fresh.<br/><br/>As I wrote in Charles Blow's op-ed earlier this week:<br/>"It is thanks to the efforts of those who promoted the concept of Citizens United and then went on to disrupt the function of government that we now have Trump, Bush, Walker, Santorum, Huckabee, Paul and all the rest. The plutocrats wreaked chaos upon our political system through the Heritage Institute and ALEC. Each of these candidates represents different facets of racism, sexism, ignorance, patriarchy and oligarchy. This entire clown car represents the risks of sowing chaos in order to gain control. From the ashes they expected a beautiful phoenix to rise. Instead, they got trumped by a Trump..."<br/><br/>Clinton has a separate problem. She is running at a time when Democrats are done with neoliberalism. Polling has consistently shown that voters have moved to the left. Clinton, for all the teasing in the lead up to her run, didn't do her homework. Simply using current-day buzzwords while continuing to mete out 90's era policy, with very little detail, just isn't going to cut it. Voters, over these last seven years, have been religiously reading Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz and Robert Reich. They know what needs to be done and Bernie Sanders has had that beat covered for the last 40 years.<br/><br/>You can't say you're progressive anymore unless you really are.

I for one welcomed the self-deprecating humor of A Walk in the Woods. Too much of travel writing feels like trumped up self-aggrandizing (I am thinking of Jon Krakauer). Bill’s tone was a relief while still expressing the beauty and history of the AT. 

1393
What trump calls 'truthful hyperbole,' Princeton Philosophy Professor, Harry G. Frankfort called 'bulls**t.' in an academic paper titled: "On Bulls**t" (asterisks added by me.)<br/><br/>After Frankfort's paper got published and spent 26 weeks on the NYT best seller list, another group of philosophers wrote "Bulls**it and Philosophy" trying to analyze and understand that popularity.<br/><br/>In brief: BS pays no attention to the truth and the user of BS may not even know what is true. (S)he just says whatever will gain him/her the desired results. How better to describe Trump?

1394
"But how can she (Hillary) win if she can only convey authenticity when she is losing?" <br/><br/>I think you "misunder-estimate" the value of having a woman as president, Maureen. This is huge. I believe it could revitalize the nation in many ways. Hillary can trump Trump, if she plays her cards right. The campaign is just beginning.<br/><br/>Trump is macho. He is chutzpah. Hillary has the feminine touch. She can focus our attention on the family, education, the community, feelings, patience, diplomacy, humility, etc. <br/><br/>Trump is the past. Hillary Clinton is the future...<br/>====================================

1395
I don't see why everybody assumes that Donald Trump won't win the nomination. He advocates most of the same lunatic positions as the 16 dwarfs. Theodore Roosevelt once said of an opponent that "he means well feebly." The Republican 16 mean evil feebly. They have no ideas, and have to get them from the half-witted Grover Norquist, the imbecile Arthur Laffer, and the demonic Paul Wolfowitz. Trump trumpets evil loudly and triumphantly, and occasionally has--not an idea but--an ABERRATION which sets him off from the others. And we Democrats should all be grateful that he's destroying the termites of the Republican party. 

1396
. . . and it's what you get that scares me. The trump card is to bring in the people who caused the problems, Carl Ichan and Jack Welch for instance, to solve the problems.

1397
while we all know your particular dislike for the divine miss H, you seem Mo to have a false equivalency going here. yes, I too am sickened by the prospect of Clinton, the lesser competent, exalting us how we havent yet been force fed enuf identity politics, but she has actually done something tangible. and when the justice dept finally finds their fall-gal in her staffer, it'll a be over as it should be for this non-issue.and the T-man is her ONLY hope of getting back to 1600 b/c media utterly refuses to cover the real phenom that is Bernie.<br/>yes, she sickens me, but WHEN the billionaire crooks that run the RNC tell the minions (at least the yellow ones are cute) to cook up a crooked plot to dump trump and he runs 3rd party, it'll be a coat-tail cakewalk. and lets hope one that ends the legacy candidacy once and for all. your brother dowd (you forgot to include, no relation) hits the nail on the head. which also means that dollars (less of the citizens united type I hope) to donuts, 2020 is wide, wide open as the entitled boomer mindset will have dies its rightful death. but the curious artifact that is trump is more america again looking for a hero as Prez, not a tool of the status quo.<br/>Im reminded of the lyric from Mrs Robinson: "where have you gone Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you....." koo-koo-ca-chou.

1398
That is why i do not think Donald trump will win elections. Everybody says he is a good businessman but a worthy politician. I do not think he is a perfect businessman. Donald Trump’ father Fred Trump was real estate tycoon so Donald just succeeded his fortune. By the way, Trump's so-called empire had been bankrupt for 4 times!<br/>By the way, Hillary is CEO of a kind too. Her ties with Wall Street and lobby are obvious.

You're healthy, with a good metabolism. A person who is not like you may find carbs have become a problem. I recently learned that you can have problems with carbs for years before symptoms like insulin resistance, etc. show up. Had I known what is now known about these issues back when I was young and starting to struggle with my weight, I'd have followed Dr. Atkins' program. I may have been able to stave off Type 2 diabetes longer or avoided it altogether. OTOH, factors like age and genetics may still have trumped lifestyle and I may have ended up exactly where I am today. I don't have a magical crystal ball to tell me for sure "what would have happened if". <br/><br/>What I do know is that at the time I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, I was walking a lot, taking public transportation to work. And I was eating exactly the diet the diabetes educator recommended to me. If that diet with regular exercise is supposed to help people with diabetes, why didn't it keep me from getting the disease? And why did my sugar levels spike so high when I ate exactly what they recommended? The logical conclusion is that, at least for my body, that recommendation was completely wrong. The answer for me was in the mantra the doctors and nurses kept repeating, "Diabetes means your body doesn't metabolize carbs well." So, I came to another logical conclusion-if diabetes means my body doesn't metabolize carbs well, maybe I ought to stop eating so many carbs. Did that and my sugar levels normalized.

1400
Maybe the best of a very bad lot, but still shouldn't be president.   As far as Hillary's so called liabilities.   In general, they seem to go back to when Bill was president.  While I disagree with a lot of what he did-welfare to work and deregulation-the economy did very well while he was president and we actually had a balanced budget.  Of course the shrub and his wingers fixed that along with greenspan's concerns about what we were going to do when we paid off the national debt.  I'm pulling for a trump-huck ticket.

1401
Western style good governance? Seriously?<br/><br/>The republicans work tirelessly to eliminate any drop of regulation and governance on business wherever they possibly can, often by reducing the budgets of regulatory agencies so they can no longer regulate. Then when something truly awful happens and people die, they stand up on their hind legs and bray that the agency they defunded is not doing its job, and should be closed.<br/><br/>Shareholder value has trumped human life in this country since Lee Iacocca personally lobbied Nixon to veto the requirements for shoulder belts in cars, claiming the added cost to be too expensive for car manufacturers, even if it did save hundreds of lives a year.<br/><br/>So yeah, we're a LOT more like the Chinese than we're willing to admit. 

1402
When you have to go to Houston to eat pizza with someone you call "Poppy" Bush to find political insight, when Hillary Clinton only appeals to you as a victim, well what more needs to be said? Especially when you won't even mention Bernie Sanders while talking about voter dissatisfaction with the status quo, one reason Trump is climbing in the polls? <br/><br/>Charles. P. Pierce nails it: <a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a37394/sanders-and-trump-call-for-revolution/" title="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a37394/sanders-and-trump-call-for-revolution/" target="_blank">http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a37394/sanders-and-tr...</a><br/><br/>"It is not enough to claim that both men are "populists" or that they are both appealing to some amorphous general dissatisfaction with "government." First of all, the only problem Sanders has with government is that it hasn't done enough to fix a rigged financial system and to stop the erosion of a viable middle class. The problem Trump has with government is that he's not running it. One is asking for a revival of grassroots democratic activism. The other is appealing for applause. One campaign's vision is a guy knocking on doors. The second campaign's vision is a strongman on a balcony. One is LaFollette. The other is Peron or, at best, Berlusconi. The first is the way democracy is supposed to work. The second is how democracy always manages to con itself."<br/><br/>The American people know something is seriously wrong with this country - while gatekeepers like Dowd are making sure only the conmen will get any attention.

1403
The real threat to Hilliary Clinton is the Lemmings of the commercial media industry who could not bring the Clinton's down in their fake, trumped up "scandal" over Whitewater are now salivating over a second bite of the Apple.  The "e-mail scandal" is just as fake.  There is nothing there but the media has proved they can manufacture a "scandal" with nothing more than innuendo.<br/><br/>It's the commercial media industry I do not trust.  Look how they uncovered all the Bush II-Cheney falsehoods about Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq?

1404
Charles P. Pierce is doing a far better job covering the 2016 campaign than the vast majority of the commentariat. Here's his response to GOP pollster Frank Luntz panic attack over Trump's poll numbers:<br/><br/>"So far, The Libidinous Visitor has done nothing and has said nothing in his campaign that the untouched Republican saint, Ronald Reagan, didn't say or do in either of his campaigns. The people quoted above could have been talking to a reporter in 1980. In its perpetual campaign to cast Reagan in marble and set him atop a shining city on a hill, the "Republican establishment" has sancitified amiable duncehood, smiling deceit, and personal political nihilism presented as patriotism of the highest order. And now Luntz is nervous because people have taken this entire beatification process to heart and applied it to someone Frank Luntz thinks is an impure vessel?"<br/><br/>See the whole thing (it's short) at: <a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a37411/gop-pollster-frank-luntz-afraid-of-donald-trump-power/" title="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a37411/gop-pollster-frank-luntz-afraid-of-donald-trump-power/" target="_blank">http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a37411/gop-pollster-f...</a>

Not true. Atkins, done properly, does not leave you feeling hungry. The food for many diet plans is not inherently "horrible and tasteless". But because the people who develop diets are usually not chefs, the menus and recipes they create are horrible and tasteless. But when people who understand food and cooking techniques start creating menus and recipes, the quality of the food rises to the same quality as the food eaten before starting the chosen weight loss food plan.<br/><br/>For me, following a low carb food plan, I've slept better and have more energy. I'm not hungry. I never get heartburn, etc. Once I learned low carb cooking techniques, cooking good food is simple.  It's the right plan for my body.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with it is the lack of support. Most restaurants will make reasonable accommodations-subbing non-starchy veggies for the starch, for example, but often I pay extra. Dinner parties and pot lucks are an  issue, too. We live in a food world where carbs rule. Even salads have become carb-laden. People sugar-coat the nuts and add fruit, particularly dried fruit, to an otherwise low carb salad. Salad dressings are loaded with sugar. Food corporations put sugar in everything, even foods that don't need it, which increases the carb load of your overall diet. Since this is what controls Type 2 diabetes, I end up making a lot of foods from scratch, making it a less convenient way to eat. Health trumps convenience, though, so I do the work.

1406
Bush is old, trump is old, so I can't possibly imagine who you are proposing we "move on" to. <br/><br/>Governance should be a long-term steady hand on the wheel, has little to nothing to do with being old. 

1407
Being right on the issues is never enough. Rhetoric trumps reality. The medium is the message. Sophistry rules over common sense. It's contingent upon Democrats to frame policy in language with which the general public can understand and relate. The populist message needs to be reworked and refined in order to achieve buy-in by a majority of Americans.

1408
It is about time that all of trump's proposals were implemented, especially making hedge funds pay a fair tax and to end inversions.  Obama has done nothing because he is a corporatist creation.  How refreshing for trump to take on these issues and restore a fair tax system.  Kudos to him.

1409
they already have a system in place for the fascism when it comes-- the overly militarized police forces across this country-- military weapons and too many officers who are vets. And tons of military personnel who have never seen a day of active duty in any of our trumped up "conflicts," but are in large groups at huge bases all over the US, ready to be called up when "needed." 

1410
This article confirms my conviction that Trump supporters (trumpettes) are not really listening to him. He is so inconsistent in his principles, if he even has any. Republicans support him even though he likes universal health care and wants to tax the rich?<br/> Democrats somehow overlook his love fest with Sarah Palin?<br/>It really must be blind emotion that is driving his poll numbers, because it cannot be ideas of policy.

1411
every politician is trying to torpedo trump

1412
“Those aren’t the types of things a typical Republican candidate would say.”  Who cares as long as it's the right thing to do?  This is what the establishment is really afraid of: <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/the-art-of-the-deal-donald-trump-versus-the-political-establishment/" title="http://investmentwatchblog.com/the-art-of-the-deal-donald-trump-versus-the-political-establishment/" target="_blank">http://investmentwatchblog.com/the-art-of-the-deal-donald-trump-versus-t...</a>

The claim that inflation is around the corner has been trumpeted ever since the Fed lowered interest rates to near zero. It is not happening and so far those predicting inflation have a terrible track record. So why should any one take them seriously? With interest rates low the rate of inflation may eventually go up but there is nothing to be gained and possibly much to lose by raising interest rates prematurely. There are numerous examples of countries lurching back into recession territory after raising interest rates. The more bizarre claims is that we may be risking a recession because interest rates are too low. That is a truly novel theory backed by no facts whatsoever.

1414
 Trump will never be Republic Party nominee. trump is a creation of Media/ Bill Clinton to be like Ross Perot of 1992 for the benefit of Hillary Clinton. If 1992 election was a three cornered election nobody would have known who is Bill Clinton, governor of Arkansas, a small backward state where bulk of the people either on minimum wage or on welfare.

1415
Is it any wonder that personality and perception trumps substance when we are so obsessed with celebrity and a politician's brand? Republicans seem particularly mesmerized by style over substance, but that has been the case since Reagan.  Despite the fact that many conservative holy grails like trickle down economic never worked, its failure does not matter to them so long as they advocate it with enough confidence.  Damn the evidence!<br/><br/> Kaufman is right though.  Eventually the façade will come down and we all find out if there is substance to the perception. As GWB showed, there often is not.

1416
If you are voting for trump, you already are voting for one bad one.

I'm an urban curmudgeon right wing extremist, delighting in the contradictions of the Left: bare breasted women selling  group 'selfies' in tourist-town ie Times Square ( which is not a square but NYers? I am not so sure)<br/><br/>I am nostalgic for the pre Giuliani raunch of The Deuce, even while respecting that Mr G's 'clean-up' has increased property values and pays for services that I use, thanks Rudy<br/><br/>the 'clean-up' created many 1A issues, where zoning, sacre blue, trumped (oops) 1A for such display and many micro-managed lawsuits and administrative regulations, ah Big Guv<br/><br/>as an aside, bare-breasted (unclothed) women are lawful and have been so for some time, certainly during mayor Mike's time, but only a problem under Mayor DB (of whom we conservos are NOT a fan) hmm, i see a moral there, not sure what, and now the 'cure' is to ban plazas and bring back cars, oh dear greeniacs (green maniacs) to the fore<br/><br/>ONE SOLUTION, is to ban bare chests for men and women both!!<br/><br/>(although peek-a-boo cutouts might satisfy the no-bare-pecs rule even so)<br/><br/>AS AN ASIDE, in my our curmudgeon form, I used to go to Central Park, Manhattan, where 'chair massage' people privatized public space for commercial activity and I was unable to mobilize the muni bureaucracy to return the park to commerce-free quiet use and enjoyment<br/><br/>ah 1A, who needs it<br/><br/>Righteous euro trash of course sneer<br/><br/>'free the nip'<br/><br/> where is Miley when we need her?

What a nice bedtime story.  You might want to read a bit about Trump University.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/opinion/inside-donald-trumps-university.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/opinion/inside-donald-trumps-university.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/opinion/inside-donald-trumps-universit...</a>

Is there enough common ground between the base policies of Mr. trump and Mr. Sanders that they both abandon their campaigns with the dems and g.o.p. and unite to run as a Third party? Sure would be interesting.

1420
the inflation fear-mongers have been consistently wrong over a number of years.<br/><br/>why would any rational person listen to them?<br/><br/>on the other hand, maybe the fed can signal that a "trade" is in order:  republicans agree to support additional infrastructure spending, and selective tax increases (a la donald trump) to pay for it, and if that happens the fed will increase rates up to three percent over the next year.

1421
Nor would anyone question if I was even Roman Catholic. As far as I'm concerned, I'm a baptized and confirmed Christian, following the command of Jesus who said, "Do this in remembrance of me." <br/><br/>No earthly authority trumps that.

1422
trump better watch out. he's going to get very popular with this kind of talk, and may actually win the nomination. lets see the other candidates jump on THIS bandwagon! 

1423
FDR was wealthy-turned out he was the only man who could call the rich out on their games. It takes a Trojan Horse to defeat the enemy, if that is his intention. He and Sanders communicate the same financial reform messages... though I assume Sanders doesn't trust Trump and trump having no respect for Sanders.<br/>In the end, any reform of the financial system and campaign finance is more important than any other subject because it DRIVES the decision making for everything.
