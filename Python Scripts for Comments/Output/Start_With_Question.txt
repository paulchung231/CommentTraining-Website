So how far back should we be looking?  Some stole this country from Natives?  People perhaps came across the bridge to invade North America?  Our species replaced previous ones?  The Civil War is way past my idea of anything to be concerned about today.  Simple!!

<strong>Welcome to WGOITP? for our final image of this school year!<br/><br/>We have something completely different for you today: an illustration, and one that’s animated, at that! Still there’s a story to be found and we hope you have fun figuring it out. The old rules still apply: make sure you supply evidence to back up whatever you think is going on.<br/><br/>Once again, we hope you’ll read the comments of others. If you agree or disagree with someone—or want to build on his or her ideas—it’s easier than ever in the new format. Click on the word “reply” under every posting and then tell your fellow commenter what you think. And you can continue to refer to that comment in your own by including the commenter’s name with an @ sign in your own post. You now have two ways to tell someone you’d like to “talk.”<br/><br/>Come back tomorrow morning to read the article that accompanied this image when it was published by the Times. And meanwhile, show us your best thinking for one more time before we say, “So long for the summer!” </strong>

"If the Iraqis don’t care enough to defend and sacrifice for their own country, then why should the United States?"The simple truth...   "Beware foreign entanglements" and all that !!

Unrealized horrors? Good one! And there is not such thing as climate change either.

Why didn't the author put in the exact language from the statute that has expired? We are condemning or extolling one side or the other without any awareness and knowledge of the exact code sections that are being debated.  This train has left the station regards of Rand Paul's meager efforts.  A New slightly modified law will be enacted and the NSA will turn the lights back on shortly!!!  <br/><br/>Remember, the "Patriot Act" was Dick Chaney's, &amp; Rummy's golden child pushed through the Senate all those trillion of dollars of defense appropriation off budget years ago during the days we were looking for weapons of mass destruction as the basis for invading Iraq.  We all would not invade Iraq knowing now what we do, and so I guess 'probable cause' and judicial process in the light of day via affidavits can be trusted in a criminal courts of law in order to get appropriate search warrants.

The hell is the matter with people? Now I want to go adopt an African kid just so I can make friends with you. Sheesh. <br/><br/>I mean, hair is fraught, and as a nervous white liberal I am often afraid to bring up hair for fear I'll say something stupid or condescending, because I read too many Gloria Naylor novels. But if you brought it up, I'd be all over it like ... uh ... white on rice?!

Evidence? Of what, exactly? Cutting taxes on the rich has only one real purpose: cutting taxes on the rich. And it works beautifully! If you were dumb enough to fall for that "job growth" nonsense, you're dumb enough to keep voting Republican no matter what. On a related note, did you hear there's a whole town somewhere that is totally ruled by Sharia law?

Isn't it ironic that the very politicians who run against government, and pretend to be Libertarians are solidly in favor of allowing that same government to spy upon all of us? Who is kidding who here? Then to add insult to injury, the Democrat President who is  also Nobel Laureate, and damned by them for being a socialist cosmopolitan is allied with them against us...the People to be spied upon! How can it possibly get any sillier, and we are stuck with having to watch all of this nonsense as a mute, but captive, peanut gallery.

How about we get contraceptives and abortion services covered first?<br/><br/>I'm not sure why there is some sort of divine right to an erection, yet the woman on the other end of this sexual encounter is forced to bear any offspring that might result from this union.  Assuming, of course, that the male involved cannot be bothered to use a condom or have his own tubes tied off.  This is the issue that needs solving first and foremost.  <br/><br/>And, you know, women don't need a drug for sexual pleasure.  They only need partners who care.  Another medical-pharma FAIL!

What is it that the NYTimes wants?  What do they suggest?  Perhaps they are not qualified to determine police policy.  The are not!<br/><br/>But what do others suggest?  The media continue to dig up tragic stories, stories that make up &lt;.01% of the outcomes.  A man supposedly dies because of a tazer.  ???  I'm thinking that it a one in a million outcome and was likely not fully vetted.  <br/><br/>We have violent people in our society.  When the police come to stop an altercation, and the person commiting it refuses to stop and others are at risk, what should the police do?  Overcome them with force, shoot them with a taser, shoot them with a gun.  Tasers stop a person, and they do so without significant harm.  Guns are likely to kill - one cannot rely on shooting someone in the leg and even if they do, the NYTimes wouldn't like that either.  <br/><br/>So, do we just let the criminals and violent offenders commit whatever act they like and hope no one dies?  And once done, will the media blame the police for not intervening?  <br/><br/>What, please tell us, should the police do when confronted with a potentially violent or criminal person who is resisting arrest?

When will someone do the investigative reporting as to where men and women being hired in the police departments across the US are being trained?    In the US many police departments hire men and women directly from the military--just got back from Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, with your PTSD, you are the perfect candidate to be hired by the local police force to control our unruly population of 750 people!    These newly minted police officers are never trained to de esculate a situation.  They are trained to shoot to kill immediately and they have a license to do so.  We are the only country in the world who hires directly out of the military.     The results are stunning across the country

How often do you get a traffic violation?  I haven't had one in about 18 years, and I drive every single day.  Can someone explain to me why the poor have more traffic violations than others?  Running a red light is a dangerous thing to do!  Driving with tail lights/head lights out is dangerous.  Speeding is dangerous.  <br/><br/>I truly do not believe that the poor are being picked on for these violations.  I think that like many laws they break constantly, they look upon rules and laws as "suggestion", not as "must do's".  <br/><br/>In rural areas, a car is absolutely a necessity, but in cities, there IS public transportation.  Driving is not a right, it's a privilege and it must continually be earned by not violation traffic laws.  Abuse it and lose it.

"Deal's" meaning in this context?<br/><br/>It means giving the Greek government a break, and the rest of the EU eating the forgiven debt. Spreading it over 26 or so nations dilutes the pain. Next, Spain, Italy, and others ask for a break. At what point does a debt lose any meaning of obligation?<br/><br/>The EU's more financially secure members should hold the Greek government's feet to the fire. Nothing else will teach a known cheat of a government that dismisses all sense of obligation that lenders mean business. Maybe, this would encourage honest Greek politicians to emerge. That will never happen as long as crooks (yes, crooks!) dominate Greek politics.

Um, am I living in a parallel universe? This piece entirely misses the mark. We are at this very moment struggling with all the issues these prescient individuals diagnosed as far as back as forty years ago. There are still way too many people on this planet, with a number of major consequences. <br/><br/>As a result our wild spaces and animals are under enormous pressure, and our food security is under tremendous threat due to a changing climate and rapidly communicable viral infections that have adversely affected everything from bees to chickens. All of which can be traced back to one factor: too many mouths to feed.<br/><br/>So what has changed exactly? The timeline may have taken a little longer but everything they have predicted has come to pass. You cannot argue with the numbers - the global population is still increasing at a tremendous rate. Seven billion people and counting! <br/><br/>It doesn't matter if growth is slowing in first world countries, where they can actually afford to have more children, its the third world countries that are the problem. And those are precisely the places that will be most affected by climate change.

Well Betsy, I wonder what your reaction would be to an advertisement accusing the Irish of being drunks by nature?  Perhaps the Presbyterian church would like to place an advertisement referring to the Pope as the anti-Christ.  Or maybe the an anti-immigration group would call for a limitation on Italians (such ads were common in the early part of the 20th century.) Check out the "American Freedom Defense Initiative".  They are an extreme Zionist organization that has a lot of money and wants to  cause a rift of ignorance between  Muslims in general, and the American Public.  Not all Muslims are terrorists any more than all Irishmen are drunks, all Italians are Mafia, all African Americans are intent on raping white women, or all Jews are slippery and dishonest.  You're trying hard to ingratiate yourself with some group.  An advertisement should be on the transit vehicles warning about YOU !

Who's willing to fight for Iraq?<br/><br/>Not us! Not anymore and lots of us never were!<br/><br/>A trillion $$$ spent on inadequate body armor for our troops, weapons, "training" the "Iraqi military," building roads and schools in Iraq while here there are potholes and crumbling bridges, sliding out of the middle class, unable to afford college, unable to pay exorbitant medical bills, many losing their homes in the mortgage crisis, pensions squandered by Wall Street as jobs have been shipped overseas. The perfect storm of neglecting Americans while 'fixing' the rest of the world. Iraq is in worse shape now.  Meanwhile, the majority of our government has been uncaring or asleep at the switch about the struggles of average Americans.<br/><br/>Those desiring the Republican nomination are itching to get reinvolved in Iraq, barking mad that Obama won't commit more advisors (what we called them in Vietnam - "advisors").  Warmongering candidates and FOX news slander the president, refusing to believe the American people back him against intervention in Iraq and Syria, where the right wants to fight brutal sectarian regional wars they don't understand.<br/><br/>Thanks to President Obama for keeping us out of further stupid military involvements.  Those running for president must want to rebuild this country - for everyone! - not spend more $$$ on middle east chaos hawks insist needs 'American exceptionalism.'<br/><br/>Exceptionally disheartened and disillusioned is what many of us are.  And ready for Bernie Sanders.

Why should the USA get involved?  <br/><br/>The Greeks elected the criminals that got the Greek Nation into this situation!<br/><br/>Many of the Greek people are living off of the Greek government checks and contracts.<br/><br/>How many wealth consuming Government Bureaucrats, Pensioners, Government Contractors and other Government Activities can the wealth creating taxpayers afford to support, before the resulting higher taxes drive those businesses and the non-government jobs away to some foreign country?

You want to take sides in the Sunni-Shia show?  Are you kidding me?

This is where we need to have the guts to push back?! How about pushing back against the our nation's propensity for warmaking? How about pushing back against our annual bloated "defense" budgets? How about pushing back against arm sales to Middle Eastern nations? We have an obligation to care for our servicemen and women when they return. If Americans don't want to endure the expense, then stop supporting endless wars.

Equal access to the fruits of labor? Humbug!<br/><br/>War is a dinosaur industry kept alive by elites whose power is so great as to be unimaginable? What is unimaginable is that statement. It's a fantasy of the followers of cranks like John Zerzan that, pre-civilization, humans were peaceable. Rather, they were (and here's that word again) unimaginable brutes who engaged in the most unimaginable (!) slaughter. But perhaps their elites were to blame for this? But that is unimaginable.<br/><br/>That "elites," whoever they are, control everything is just not true, despite the belief's near ubiquity on the socialist fringe. It is definitely true that we have a system in which money plays too big a part, but rich people, like other people, disagree with one another, want different things, support various causes, and oftentimes fail to achieve their objectives.<br/><br/>To posit that, once finance capitalism is eradicated, mankind will, by some unforeseeable miracle, evolve into peace-loving hippies is fantastical. In case you haven't noticed -- and you haven't -- capitalist countries have a rather notable affinity for peace, not war. You've got things quite the wrong way 'round.<br/><br/>Blame Goldman Sachs, Walmart, Lockheed Martin, and the Koch Brothers.<br/>But I'm blaming John Doe.

1914? Hmm. The comparison may apply in different form. Putin's Russia has been making noises in supporting the new, alleged "socialist" government and the Chinese may be thinking similarly but hasn't yet committed to any one. Back a hundred years ago there were alliances everywhere of big wealthier states supporting smaller, poorer nations. But by and large there was a "racial" quality to the top two gruops. The Austro-Hungarians allied with Germany, while Czarist Russia was allied with Serbia. Thus the Aryans vs the Slavs were the main players. The first world war began on this eastern front between Austro-Hungarian and Germans against the Serbian and Russians over the assassination of the future emperor Archduke Ferdinand of the weakening Austrians. <br/><br/>England and France had an alliance with Russia to counter the rising German influence so the whole powder keg ignited that also dragged the "sick man of Eurpoe" the Caliphate of Turkey, otherwise known as rhe Ottoman Empire. Add in all the colonies of both sides and Bang!, the World had the "Great War", aka WWI. Further, it was also a Rich vs Rich vs Poor. <br/><br/>Nowdays the Rich are sticking together and the Poor be damned.

"Can we just age and deal with it, whatever it brings?"?  Why?  I want to feel as well as possible for as long as possible, as do many people.  A lot of us take supplements, eat healthy, go to the doctor's for checkups, wear sunscreen, exercise, etc. in order to stave off the effects of aging (and the accompanying aches, pains and discomforts).  I, for one, feel absolutely fantastic - physically and emotionally - for doing so!  If a medication like this helps people in one more way, why not?!

Derp, you say?  This is the guy who thought the trillion dollar coin might be a good idea and said this in 1998:  "The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in "Metcalfe's law"--which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants--becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other!” wrote Krugman. “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.”

How exactly is the graph deceptive? It's incredibly straightforward.<br/><br/>Brownback swore if he got his trickle-down economic tax cuts, Kansas would see above average economic growth, job creation and a balanced budget. Instead, as the very simple graph demonstrates, Kansas has slower than average job growth, even if compared to the U.S. average (which Republicans claim is substandard, despite being greater than we had under George W. Bush).<br/><br/>Now, I would say YOUR information is deceptive. Your first link, for example, talks about job growth in Colorado...ONLY Colorado!! Since Dr. Krugman never mentions Colorado, what does your link have to do with his column?<br/>And your second link has nothing to do with job creation, only oil production, and even at that never once mentions Kansas!!<br/><br/>So, what, exactly are you trying to say since nothing you link to or talk about is even remotely related to Dr. Krugman's comments?

Is it also sexist that there is no birth control pill for men to take to ensure they do not father children?<br/><br/>No?<br/><br/>I guess feminism only goes so far.<br/><br/>The good thing though is that once this gets approved and women insist it be covered, that FINALLY, Viagra can be covered for men, too.  NOT!  But you can be sure, this will be covered.

Why "should" they do that, Ron?  <br/><br/>Aren't there already enough ways for people in committed relationships to express and show that to the rest of the world?<br/><br/>Engagement rings, wedding rings, wedding and engagement announcements in the media, photos on your desk at work, etc, etc, etc.  We get it -- you're in a relationship!  Congrats, now leave the bridges alone.

How I cured Plantar fasciitis? It took me almost two years figure out. I tired almost everything, taping, splints, ice, and multiple exercises that I found online. nothing really seem to take the pain away for good. I didn't want top just heal it every time i'm in pain, I was hoping to make this go away. After spending hundreds of dollars no longer was I putting frozen golf balls on my foot.

Sunni &amp; Shia? Nah! It's Persian vs Arab killing each other as they have for the past few thousand years? Let them keep killing each other and spreading their war out thru the Middle East until a new empire, Egyptian, Persian, Arab or Turk, arises and drops their new iron fist on the whole shooting match. If we still have to buy oil from them hope that at least it is not the Saudis, who unfortunately are still living in the 14th century.

     What would happen if Greece's government embarks in megaprojects of, say, infrastructure building, cutting down unemployment, allowing the public spending to take over what private timidity is unable or unwilling to do? Anything is better that an exit from the 'Union', some of us non-experts can intuit...and hoping that the powers to be will wake up in time and correct course before its too late. Austerity per se won't cut it. Are we blind? Do we need a jolt? And Europe cannot be stronger that its weakest link, and the answer is not in getting rid of it...but fortifying it!

Who is willing to fight for Iraq?   Nobody, as is clear for all to see.  To date, nothing good has come from the hundreds of thousands of lost lives and trillions (!!) of dollars wasted on this foul mess.  The suggestion that sending more American arms or troops (trainers or fighting troops) will change the "state" of Iraq for the better is a sign that the Times Editorial Board has either lost touch with reality, or has sadly become another paid flack for the military industrial complex.  While neither answer makes me feel better, I feel obliged to ask:<br/>Which is it?

It is difficult to imagine what it must feel like to be born in the wrong body?  I usually try to be open-minded and put myself in other people's shoes but this one stumps me... I am happy that she finally feels authentic and is living without fear of her secret being revealed... however I do feel bad his kids.  This will take an enormous amount of therapy sessions!

FIFA ? Really ?  I see pictures of the toting out boxes from FIFA offices and here in this article the American Soccer organization is being kept in the loop - no doubt to utter perfection. But , wait for it,nobody really cares. We do not care about "deflate-gate",and we do not acre about FIFA corrupt or not. It stands to reason that this bribery activity  took place outside of the US jurisdiction,but that does not stop us from showing up and making it front page news. What do you think they are looking for ? I know, they must be looking for the culprits behind the global financial crisis which is an American born destruction of trillions of dollars which impairs balance sheets and the ability of people to retire to this very day. Go get em FBI !

Perhaps my view is simplistic, but if we know that population must peak eventually, what is the argument that tackling the demographic transition to a stable population and the attendant aging that must occur as it does stabilize will be easier in the future at a larger population size than it would be now?  I have not heard a compelling such argument.<br/><br/>In 2050 at 9 billion we'll be worried that we don't have enough people?!  Seriously?

Whether or not it reduces malpractices suits, shouldn't a doctor strive to be the best professional she/he can be?  Why do doctors balk at being courteous to their paying clients who are frequently in pain, frightened and in need of nothing more than common and professional courtesy?  Is that really too much to ask of an educated, pampered, extremely well-paid professional?<br/><br/>I get the feeling that doctors think courtesy toward their paying clients is somehow demeaning.  It is a retail profession just like a store clerk.  I am paying you a hefty sum and I am your customer.  Just as you expect to be treated well when you open your wallet, your clients do as well.  <br/><br/>I do not think this is strictly a problem with medicine.  This is an issue with customer service across the board.  Too many businesses fail to understand how important service (courteous, professional, prompt, accurate) is to their clients.  These days I would much rather buy things online than deal with an irritable clerk.  If I could deal with a medical robot rather than a jerk of a doctor in the future, sign me up!

Public expression of religion trumping wealth/education in terms of being  factor of insertion? I don't think African Americans would agree with you!

So an employer is required to let employees visually scream their religion to everyone?! The hijab isn't a 1/2" necklace pendant.  You can tell the hijab wearer's religion from three football fields away.<br/><br/>There needs to be a distinction between ostentatious and more reserved religious symbols. This distinction is made in countries like France and Turkey.

"Apolitical?" You can NOT be serious! Jack Warner is, among other things, a *politician* in T&amp;T...a professional one.<br/>Sorry mate, launder money in the US and you might end up in prison. Chuck Blazer started the ball rolling by failing to file income taxes for some years, despite owning TWO Trump Tower apartments, one for hi frickin' CAT  The investigation was nothing more than tax evasion. Until Blazer, Jack Warner's bagman, started singing to get leniency. Now it's anything goes. If you think Loretta Lynch cares one little bit about football,  then you are delusional.

So -- you think FIFA is happy that we are finally interested in soccer?<br/><br/>FIFA is located in Switzerland, so the Swiss have a concern here.  As for the US, the banks involved tended to be American and add to it that many of the major sponsors are US corporations, that brings the US into it.  <br/><br/>As for the utility of US involvement, FIFA for years whenever a country is looking to clean up soccer nationally (like Spain and Brazil a few years back) FIFA cries "political interference in sport!" and threatens to suspend the local FA and national team.  That would mean the leagues are now outlaw leagues (and can be raised) and the national teams cannot participate in FIFA competitions (so no World Cup for you).  This would be a political disaster in much of the world.  So what was needed was a country to get involved that was important enough economically to hurt FIFA but where soccer was not the major sport, so there would be no political backlash against the government if the local FA  was suspended.  And that means the US.  <br/><br/>I hope FIFA gets cleaned up.  But there is too much money in sport now and I fear that makes corruption a given.

what it this about anyway? Including the outfit and come hither look, that I as a bona fide woman has always found really stupid. I guess if you are male and have a simple stylized idea of what a female is.<br/><br/>So why not be dressed on the cover of a national magazine?  Women usually are.  Or is this just a game for prurience? And I don't know this person, don't read the kind of magazines that feature this stuff, avoid daytime TV like the plague.  ahhh! Please just stop.

So how about physicians who work under a corporate practice structure where their "performance, " hence, income is determined by arbitrary metrics that do not involve communicating effectively with patients, rather practicing in a way that benefit the managers of the corporate practice ?  The example of the ER study and acute coronary syndrome is great and all, but what if your ER doctors are under extreme pressure by the hospital CEO to have disposition of patients by a certain time period?  We had an advertisement in our town a few years back that touted "30 minutes or less!"  It is very tough to effectively communicate under those circumstances.

Let me see if I've got this straight; I can threaten ANY kind of 'violence' on the Internet but if my 'heart' is in the right place, no harm, no foul?<br/>Just the type of decision I'd expect the worst SCOTUS ever to come up with. Estranged husbands can threaten violence all day long to ex-wives creating an atmosphere of 'terror' for that woman and it's okay? I ask because I know of an instance where this was happening to a friend of mine. And, guess what, the cops said there's nothing they could do unless he actually did something. Sounds like the Supremes are backing this up with yet another decision predicated on the laws of the 'fantasy land' they seem to inhabit versus the real world where people are flesh and blood (Not corporations) and 'threatening messages' must be backed by 'threatening behavior' before anything can be done!<br/>Sounds like a great time for everyone to go arm themselves...wait, we're doing that all ready!

Robin Roberts was correct when she said that because women play the game virtually without the dunk makes their game more fluid and beautiful. The dunk has been a pox upon the men's game primarily because it requires far less skill that shooting and passing. The writer did make an important point that study must be done before the rim could be lowered for women. Good! Complete a study and reject the idea. The geniuses who control the men's game have been trying for years to make their game more exciting. They have the dunk, but scoring is down.  Hmmm. May I suggest raising the rim?

How many was scandals and how many still will be about FIFA?!  The end have all are always happy , and now the American government dares to interfere slander, thereby to do much harm Russia. Where conscience and justice?

A ROMANTIC LOCK?  A romantic type of lock, to me, would be something like a liplock.  Not a piece of metal hanging from a bridge.  The Parisians, thank goodness, are standing around French kissing, while the tourists file by on the bridge appending cold metal locks to it.  Whatever happened to Vive L'amour! in the City of Lights?  Is the amorous spirit of the city to be imprisoned.  Or will the government include a lock attaching activity on the banks of the Seine when it opens its temporary beach, Paris Plage, there?  The French response to this conundrum might be a Baf!, a shrug of the shoulders, or most idiosyncratically, a French version of a Bronx Cheer (aka a raspberry, renamed framboise or a Paris Cheer).  That is performed by a Parisian sitting at an outdoor cafe, with his chin on his hands, elbows on table, sighing deeply and emitting a noise somewhere between a kid imitating a motorcycle and a machine gun (OK soft ones).  Pppppppppppppppppppp!

Where are the other countries what have been cheated?  Let's all withdraw from FIFA and set up another association.  If 2/3 rds of the world withdraws from this scheme, FIFA will go broke.  <br/><br/>Let the counrys that bribed the voters have their games.  They will go bankrupt which is exactly what they deserve.  Let the countries that voted for Blatter sink with him.<br/><br/>That is the only way to clean up this cesspool.  Why is there even a suggestion of reform.  <br/><br/>Where are the sponsors?  Stoop buying their products.  This will end in weeks!<br/><br/>What are we waiting for.

8875
How about repealing the law?  Impossible, you say!  Not really, but an effort at repeal takes executive and legislative leadership.  <br/><br/>Lawyers are in a chess game.  It's impossible to try to verdict every criminal case brought in the federal courts.  So how do you entice defendants to plead rather than go to trial?  <br/><br/>This is a lawmakers' problem.  We shouldn't blame it on the prosecutors.

YOU MUSTA BEEN A BEAUTIFUL BABY?  But baby, look at you now!  On the cover of Vanity Fair no less.  This is truly the moment of transgender consciousness.  And to think the same person won the Olympic decathlon.  What a knockout!  And it's so neat!  They even got Buzz Bissinger to dish about Caitlin while dishing himself about his own cross dressing!

You live in Colorado? "Focus" is watching you! And no one has even mentioned them. They were also formed right after 9/11, now have, I understand, at least 70 buildings, with their headquarters in Colorado. They have absolutely NO oversight by anybody. I bet they haven't even been slowed by the actions in Congress. They're probably monitoring this site right now!

How many of these for-profit insurers lost money last year?  I would guess very few, if any.  Therefore no increases are justified.  Some years a company loses money, sometimes they gain.  Nobody should be guaranteed profit.  And these companies can afford a down year now that they have a bucket of money in reserve that they just took from consumers who are required to buy their product.  Regulators: regulate to protect the consumer!

9311
What liberty? What freedom?<br/><br/>There's no question that government snoops were ... and are ... checking your every move but they're not the only ones. Corporate marketing keeps track of every key click. Political strategists poke and prod constantly with their vast databases. Charities (some legit, most not) trade information about you like baseball cards. Social media keep extensive files on you. Why do you think you get such targeted emails from Facebook?<br/><br/>The fact is that privacy went the way of the Dodo bird a long time ago and it's not coming back. To think that tweaking this one law will change anything is like trying to shovel back the tide with a teacup.<br/><br/>Rather than moaning about privacy, let's go for "public and accountable" for EVERYBODY instead. Let's level the field and force the power brokers to be more transparent and stop keeping secrets from us. We might be able to actually do something worthwhile there.<br/><br/>"Public and Accountable" !!!

9322
If, after some relatively long stretch of time (10, 15, 20 years?), we ever recover from the GR, return to pre-GR employment levels, incomes begin to rise even modestly, and inflation goes ups a couple of points, the Fergusons and Feldsteins will crow -- "See, we were right all along!" Ferguson, in fact, has just embarrassed himself yet again by writing that the Tory policy of austerity is a great success in the UK, when every respectable economist there believes it is a failure. But so it goes, on and on.

9325
Maybe give it another chance?<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema the first time not sure quite what to make of what I'd just experienced!  Had I just been entertained, or assaulted? <br/><br/>Sure, the "plot" is so simple and the dialog minimal, but I really think that's the brilliance of this film...  there IS a subtext to it all, but it's not spoon-fed to us like we expect to be.  <br/><br/>Instead we're just dropped right in the middle of this bonkers world, and forced to start running relentlessly to barely keep up with the sheer number of off-the-wall creativity being thrown at us almost every frame.  This movie churns through ideas like candy - the "plot" doesn't need to.  It's clever and in some ways more high-art than an action flick.<br/><br/>So I went and saw it again (in 3D - recommended!), this time ready and with a bit of a head-start, and I can't say I've been excited about a movie in this way since I was about 12.<br/><br/>Just wanna add that as an Aussie, it's a *very* weird experience seeing a big-budget fantasy/action blockbuster that's so culturally "Australian" in so many ways.   Maybe my opinion is a bit biased because of that?  Nah, this film is really just so good!<br/><br/>Well, that's my 2 cents anyway..

9347
Then why didn't this happen during the Great Recession, rather than during a recovery? Carolyn Egeli, you have to pay attention to the context. There were never two years of increases through the Great Recession and then BAM! A new mayor shows up and up goes the murder rate. Not a coincidence.

9414
"Occupy 50 Best"?!?!  Yeah, because THAT is what the "Occupy" movement was about: making sure the world's most elite restaurants are selected on a fair basis. For crying out loud. 

9499
Then why is it rising now?  All those things you just said  have been around in NYC for years.  We all get that you're super liberal  -congrats!  You've said nothing new and what you've said makes zero sense in the context of this article.  Over the last 2yrs shootings and murders have increased right when stop and frisk stopped and cops have reduced arrests for low level crimes.  Maybe it's worth (probably is) but there are tradeoffs that we all must understand and accept.  Ideologues like you frame everything has either good or bad refusing to believe that what you want also comes with consequences you would rather pretend do not exist.    

9531
And just why is fancy dunking the only or best, or most exciting basketball?  There is too much sports so the lesser ones are not as popular.  Simple!!!

9533
So what else is new? Sociopolitical fanaticism is far from a novel phenomenon on college campuses. Out of the nest at last, kids wake up to the big wide world around them, from the relative safety of campus (in its way simply another nest), and develop a fairly exaggerated sense of what should be done about the world and its myriad issues, based in no small part on their own equally burgeoning sexual energy. (They don't call the feeling passion for nothing.)<br/><br/>Of course too often the adolescent fervor extends beyond graduation, and everything remains in the eyes and heart of the graduate OMG BEST/WORST EVER! The primary difference between today and yesterday is that college long ago lost its purpose of creating grownups able to analyze issues objectively and deal with them maturely.

How often do we read about prosecutors being charged and convicted of "prosecutorial misconduct?"   Very rarely!   If these lowlifes knew that they were going to lose their livelihoods and go to prison, perhaps such behavior could be reined in.

AND when will we stop to complain about 'the straightjacket of the Euro?<br/><br/>After 10 years of the existence of the Euro? -<br/>Oh - we already passed that since a few years! So 15 or 20?<br/>Or when will it get 'pathetic'? -  and we can start concentrating on solving the problems the will for Europes Unity and Peace has created.<br/><br/>Do we have such limited economical minds that we can not 'put' a 'higher' admirable and sustainable purpose above highly disbutable time and short time monetary policies?

10080
And why are they paying out so much more in premiums? BECAUSE THE ACA HAS NO COST CONTROLS WHATSOEVER!<br/><br/>WIthout cost controls, any "reforms" were doomed to certain failure. For gods sake, we are prevented BY LAW from negotiating DRUG PRICES. What on earth did people expect would happen?

I certainly agree with commenters who argue that, while Caitlyn Jenner looks beautiful, does she need to be so Photoshopped and "done up"? Equally with those who are wary that this is another calculated example of her and the Kardashians' well-known love of publicity and personal branding. But you know what? This cover could save lives. Literally. I hope every young transgender kid out there sees that, and hears someone say, "Wow--she looks great!" And you know what? She does!

Are you seriously buying into this false reporting and attack by the NYTimes?  Do you really believe that a town where 70% of the population is black will have less than 70-80% more stops for black drivers?  Seriously?!  Do you realize that, regardless of color, cops search cars when there are outstanding tickets UNPAID and/or unaddressed (go to court).  It was proven that blacks ignore the tickets, building up 10s or 100s in many cases.  That is why they are more likely to be searched, not because they are black.

Growing up, my parents never censored what I read- partly because of my mother's severe reading disability- she never read out of joy so why would she monitor something she didn't relate to?  I thank her, and my father, for that wide berth she gave me. I learned to see the world in a different light, but if I read something that made me feel uncomfortable - I put the book down! As a former English teacher, I was amazed at the amount of sheltering parents wanted for their high school children. To me, reading something in the safety of a classroom where we could discuss the contents in a measured and thoughtful way helped prepare my students for the real world.  We really don't give young adults enough credit.<br/><br/>Side note: one of the happiest moments in my life was when I opened the world of books to my mother and brother  (who also has the disability) in the form of audio books.  I worked at BnN in college and for Christmas I bought my brother the Lord of the Rings trilogy on audio book. My mother listened to them first, but both of them listen to books CONSTANTLY now! I dare say even more than I do!

Isn't this court called "strict constructionist"?<br/>Doesn't Scalia argue regularly that the words of the Founding Fathers are what count?<br/>One of the ways we learn what a person intends is by looking at what they say (especially when they say essentially the same thing, over and over!)<br/>Any husband who writes as this man did must be taken very seriously. There are too many bodies scattered around this country to overlook this sort of talk.<br/>Once again the Roberts Court got it wrong.

You really think that tax free status is a state responsibility or that they should be mandated special requirements for their labor?  I don't!!!  And the difference is abhorrent to you, capitalism to me.  If so many did not go to graduate school for dopey majors the full professors would have to teach the classes.  Simple solution.

10527
Solution?<br/><br/>Let all these companies merge (telephone, cable, internet, satellite, et al) and customers will benefit.<br/><br/>Right?<br/><br/>Remember, "trickle down" works!!<br/><br/>;-)

I sometimes worry that more emphasis is given to "is the book the right length to sell," rather than "how long does this particular story take to tell?"<br/><br/>Especially in a growing electronic world, whether a book is 50,000 words or 200,000 words is neither here nor there.  In the print world, of course, it still has a manufacturing cost to take into account.<br/><br/>I am writing a huge fantasy saga at the moment that will stretch across many volumes.  The main books are 160,000 words a piece, give or take, but one of the stand-alone books is only 56,000 words long.<br/><br/>In my mind, both lengths are justifiable, as is a short story I have written about one of the characters that is just 12,000 words. The point is that the tales are different lengths.<br/><br/>Now, I also have a decision to make. My big volumes I could split in two and possibly get more sales. But do I undermine my own work in that way? Do I insult the reader?  One day I hope they are a fan. I want to be nice to them.<br/><br/>I have read huge books that have held me and I have read short stories than bored me and I did not finish. So what is size?<br/><br/>Without being too corny, satisfaction is the important thing, not size!

10828
And how exactly would an insurance company "insist" that providers stop gouging you?  Their only option is to kick the provider out of their networks, and then the regulator screams "inadequate networks!".<br/><br/>It's the government's job to shut down "price gouging", not anyone else.<br/>WR

Does it look out of place? Certainly. But it is not a "bloated monstrosity." By itself it is not an unattractive building. In fact it seems more appropriate to the area and more efficient than the tiny old house it replaced. It doesn't make sense to have a series of long, narrow front yards in front of functionally obsolete houses in a high priced urban area. If you want quaint, move to the country! I can imagine the screams from the very same neighbors if new zoning restrictions were implemented, damaging their property values!

Excuse me, but amending a "must pass bill?" So Senators have found a problem in a bill sent over by the House... But aren't our Senators arguing "too bad, the Senate must pass this as is, given what the House gave us?"<br/><br/>That is exactly what the Senate has argued at nauseam before --that they were powerless, powerless (!) when the House sent bills that had Food Stamps extensions removed, when financial aid to students was reduced, when unemployment assistance extensions expired, when consumer protections were weakened... and that the poor Senators had no choice than to take what the House gave them.<br/><br/>So the Senate is "powerless" when House bills throw ordinary Americans under the bus, but the Senate steps in hurried and frenetically when the military-intelligence-industrial complex has a minuscule amount of its revenue reduced! Oh my! We do know who owns the Senate!

Again - what is with the US involvement in this?<br/><br/>In 2009 they did not prosecute anyone for causing the financial crisis. Now they want to prosecute a bunch of people for a sport they want nothing to do with?<br/><br/>Wall St. execs weren’t even punished….were they? Neither were the congressmen they bought. And it was all so the rich could get obscenely rich betting on exotic financial instruments that have nothing to do with the production of goods or value.<br/><br/>The losers here are the average people like you or me.<br/><br/>I, myself, have been struggling. I’m employed (temp work) but can’t afford health insurance (now up to $500/month). I don’t drive much either cause I can’t afford gas. My $24/month car insurance from Insurance Panda (god bless it) or my $11/month renters from Eagle might not be the best coverage, but its all I can afford! I cut cable and internet and I haven’t been out to eat or to the movies in god knows how long.<br/><br/>How many trillions did ordinary Americans lose in the 2008 crash? How many jobs? How many homes? How many 401Ks turned into 201Ks?<br/><br/>Imagine – If we applied FIFA standards to executive, legislative, judicial branches of our government – most of these degenerate slime balls would be behind bars.

Loretta Lynch and the US Dept of Justice can force Sepp Blatter to resign but they are unable to bring to justice the bankers and brokers who brought the economy to near disaster and simultaneously committed discrimination against minority communities that forced those groups to pay more for mortgages and also left those groups more vulnerable to foreclosure and ultimately diminished the value of their homes and neighborhoods ?! It saddens me to realize what this says about our will and priorities.

MENS REA  What about a Reasonable Justice Standard?  The fact is that in certain instances of of mass murders, evidence has been found afterward that showed clearly that the murderers had criminal intent when they wrote violent posts on the Internet.  But that's too late!  The Columbine killers had threatened a boy at school a year before the school shoot-out.  His parents went to the school officials, who said that since it did not occur during school hours they had no jurisdiction.  His parents went to the police, who said that since no crime had been committed, they had broken no laws.  We all know what happened because of that Keystone Kops set of responses.  The lives of innocent children and adults were snuffed out.  Anybody with a sufficiently murderous mind will be clever enough to lie to law enforcement officials about their intent.  The Court's finding means that if Elonis's ex-wife had sustained PTSD from his "artistic" and "cathartic" expressions of anger, that was entirely her problem.  Psychodiagnosis of such behavior would likely conclude that anyone who acts that way has symptoms of an Antisocial Personality Disorder.  Are all such persons violent criminals?  Are those written acts tantamount to yelling "fire" in a crowded theater?  Those words are pretty damned close!  In fact, I'd even say that they're tantamount to playing with fire.  No, make that setting fires, where there is a high probability that the intended victim will get burnt!  Reasonable person?

"Functionally obsolete"?  How so?  <br/><br/>"If you want quaint, move to the country!"  Some of us love New York City because quaintness is still available here as a respite from brutal modernity…but please continue to enlighten us as to what's wrong with our city from the Valhalla that is Boston.

Right wing propaganda? Hmm, methinks I smell a troll, nes pa? The description does not describe Peoria nor very few places outside of what was called Iron Curtain countries. Rather than disparage the authors descriptions you should try &amp; clarify any claims made by the author. Free speech is not a right or left argument, it is over whether there actually is free speech. On that note , enjoy your free speech !

Have you seen photographs of college students prior to the 1960s?  Talk about herds of moo-cows!  And just about all white male commie-hating moo cows at that!  Those were the days of unlimited freedom, eh?  Yes, for some...

And what did ya think was going to happen?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist...the police are our super-egos!

Well no - because when they chase the guy on the dirtbike and he loses control and crashes (because he doesn't really know how to ride)- who gets blamed??  The police!!!  It has happened before - which is why they don't bother.

Why all this vitriol when a person, with their hard earned money, builds the house they want on the land they own and within the city codes???  At the risk of being flamed, is it because she has a "foreign name"??  Further, this is happening everywhere in America. In Dallas, many houses fromn the 1950s and 1960s (ranch style houses) are being bought out by rich people for substantial money, razed, and replaced by large McMansions. Hardly a unique phenomenon. Welcome to the unbridled capitalism of America, people!

Why should only GENDER be changeable? If you can demand you are female, despite a penis, testicles and male hormones -- why does it stop there? Why can't I be young? I'd rather be young than old. <br/><br/>Why can't I insist I am tall? I'd love to be tall. Of course, I am only average height but I DEMAND you treat me as if I were tall! It's my RIGHT!<br/><br/>Why do I have to be a human? I'd rather be a swan. Or a whale. Or a poodle. I demand you treat me as whatever I claim to be! If you do not follow my demands, I will sue you for "hate crimes".

Raise premiums because of increased drug costs? It is time for the insurers to band together and oppose outrageous drug prices!  As a united front, they can force manufacturers to price more appropriately.  And yes, it will take their combined clout to convince Pharma. The American Hospital Association also has a stake in the fight, and it should join the fight.  The insurance and hospital lobbies must be as least as powerful as Pharma's, and if they have the will, they can put an end to PHARMA's sleazy tactics once and for all.<br/><br/>Our "representatives" in D.C. need to stop worrying about their next campaign contributions and change our laws to legalize drug importation. Provide some real competition for Pharma. No more excuses--pass a law now! Pharmaceuticals are among the most profitable industries in the world; why do they need to jack up prices six times a year?  Our drug costs dwarf those of any other country in the world, three or four times as much. <br/><br/>Bringing drug costs in line will eliminate at least one reason for insurance companies to raise their premiums, and most of what else they propose is based on rampant speculation -- and greed -- not actuarial certainty  They are predators, too.  It's a racket, and we are the victims!

13834
What vitriol? People are entitled to their opinions, and objectively speaking, the home that this woman built is out of scale and proportion to those around it; and not only that, it practically casts a shadow on them. What was her architect thinking? Foreign name? Who in America doesn't have a foreign name? What does that mean? You mean a non-English name? Whatever! This isn't about Texas. This is about the homes on this block, and by extension other neighborhoods with similarly cohesively styled blocks. Yes, you are correct, she built something within city codes, and therein lies the problem. The buildings department reviews these homes in a vacuum: they don't know or care what the rest of the block looks like. Meanwhile, on plenty of other issues, they can be as draconian as all get out. 

13838
Xenophobia? Whatever! Are you looking at the same photo as the rest of us? I guess you've never lived in an ethnic neighborhood. I like in one with everyone of the same immigrant ethnicity, and when people put up monstrosities like this, everyone grumbles all the same. You need to get out of your little race bubble.

Can someone explain to me WHY the Corrections Officer Benevolent Association should make contributions to the Simon Wiesenthal Center?  UNIONS should be charged with supporting their members, PERIOD!  They should not be allowed to use funds for ANY PURPOSE, no matter how worthy, that falls outside the strict parameters of supporting the union members.  This man REEKS of corruption.

Infrastructure, infrastructure? This is USA. We don't need no stinking infrastructure! I fully expect to see the US fall further and further behind the rest of the developed world during the next decade. Our roads, rails, communication systems, will continue to deteriorate. Sad for a country that has is really very rich.

If the earth was 2 times bigger would we be talking about the population problem? It's not the population it is the resources that are available for the present and growing population that is the real problem. It is amazing to see people who live in rich countries move to bigger and bigger homes, let their electronic gizmos consume electricity even when they are not using them, family of 4 has 4 or more cars and they point the finger at countries like India and China? How dare this Indian family dream of buying a car? Take the bus! Let them wallow in poverty so that we can gaily go on with our lifestyle!<br/>FYI - India and China are not overpopulated in comparison to Europe - we simply did not move out. Europeans moved out to other continents with disastrous consequences to the natives. Basically Europeans are spread out in a huge number of nations whereas we Indians and Chinese are confined to one country. What if Russia sells a part of its land to India and half of our population moves out - suddenly India's population is much smaller - has India "solved" the population problem?

Terence Stamp? Did I hear someone say Terence Stamp? Madly in love with him since he made Billy Budd in 1962 (see on TV a few years later). Let's start a Terence Stamp revival! Phooey on this version. Get me Stamp, Bates &amp; Christie any day of they week and I am hooked.

Why do you think it is funny?  It's not funny.  It's a commodity, which means many people can make good money trading it.  Do you think that there isn't any profit to be made renting out your rent controlled apartment?  <br/><br/>NYC deserves the corruption it gets.  Stop whining and start organizing a city-wide or even state-wide vote.  Get it on the ballot and get rid of the babies and bullies ripping you off!

There were rate hikes before the ACA--remember?  Now, you can not be dropped or denied because of a pre-existing condition or charged more than the next person because of that condition; now, at least 80-85% of the dollars I pay in premiums MUSt cover my care---not a CEO's bonus; well visits and recommended  preventative measures such as colonoscopy or mammograms must be covered by the premiums too--  no extra fees; in states with expanded medicaid, the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes is up as much as 26%; drug companies and insurance companies are doing quite well under the ACA; there are more health care related jobs and incentives to reduce wasteful spending because of the ACA; more urgent care centers and neighborhood clinics and more folks with coverage means less expensive ER care that we all have to pay for; the working poor (generally, single men in low-paying jobs) finally have coverage!<br/><br/>This is failure???  The failure is in the minds of the misinformed who just won't admit that the insurance industry doesn't really have our health interests as a priority, but rather profits. We have turned the system towards better patient outcomes, equal access, and cost reduction despite the insurance industry's powerful lobby. This is a good thing and we should keep going in this direction, no matter what the bloviating liars at Fox News say.

How could he not resign? Look at the debacle of the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar. As a result of the incredibly high summertime temperatures the tournament was moved to December? Right in the middle of league play for all of the European leagues.<br/><br/>Sadly, Sepp's time had passed years ago. Only graft, corruption and his personal thirst for control of FIFA kept him around as long has he was. Good Riddance!

What is the takeaway here? How much was spent to get only 29 (!!!) students to graduate high school? Millions of ordinary kids all over the US manage to get out of high school without all this fuss or cost. What was the cost here PER CHILD to accomplish this? boarding school means dormitories, cafeterias, laundry, janitorial services and more.<br/><br/>Despite these lux benefits, 51 kids dropped out -- the vast majority, more than 2/3rds. That isn't success. That is a hideous, embarrassing failure. That lefty liberalism sees this as "success" is what is truly pathetic. Millions spend so that fewer than 30 kids graduate. And of course, we still have NO IDEA if they can truly compete in a real college environment, with less pampered "special snowflakes" or kids who truly attended competitive suburban schools. What if ANOTHER 2/3rds can't make it in college? Leaving maybe 9 kids out of 80, to graduate? What then? Will Mr. Friedman still be lauding the success of his WIFE'S foundation?<br/><br/>Note: Mr. Friedman curiously looks very closely at his friends and family for examples. I recall his log rolling for the business start-ups of his kid's college roommates! Really, are there no objective examples of businesses or academic experiments to which he has no personal attachments?

Dear Frank - quick, where can I sign up to get on your Florida bandwagon?  You are undeniably the most qualified of all the GOP/Tea Party doofuses  who have clocked in and are running for the White House and the Oval Office.  9 declared dyed in the wool Republicans and 8 or 9 more undeclared wannabe POTUS candidates have already squeezed into the clown car which will regurgitate its group of coconuts at the RNC circus in 17 months.  Meanwhile, we shall be forced to see these folks, swearing allegiance to their one platform (remove Barack Obama from the Presidency - he's leaving, sadly!) and trying to sway all Americans to their awful ethos of "millions for me", zip for the poor.  We have only seen the like scam in "The Music Man" - Henry Hill and River City and his great snake-oil band of 79 trombones leading the big parade!  I would vote for you, Frank, in a New York minute , but please run as a Lib Dem instead - that merrygoround path to the platinum (or brass) ring is still pretty open with only 3 declared candidates - one, our national Granny Hillary, and one truth-teller Bernie from Vermont (via Brooklyn)  and  O'Malley from Baltimore.   The Republicans have figured out a new way to make a couple of million bucks - run for the 2016 Presidency! Bless their little uncompassionate Conservative hearts!  This race is beyond comprehension and full of quicksand for all of us - the wannabe candidates and those of us who can't decide for whom to vote.  You've got my vote, Frank.

Jeb Bush making a mockery of the law?  Oh, no, tell me it isn't true!  The Bush boys learned early that they could make a mockery of anything they want and get away with it.  No accountability for these boys (including Neal), none whatsoever.  Yeah,  that's America for you.  No accountability for the rich and powerful.  Start a pre-emptive war on lies, torture, kidnap innocents, blow up the Middle East for absolutely no good reason except W wanted to avenge his father and steal their oil.<br/><br/>Mockery?  That's a very small crime from this crime family.

how many Bushes one country is supposed to have as a president? come on man, find another job to do... if there's nothing... I suggest farming! In America, developing a political war , everyone wants to move the blanket over himself.

Maybe we never were a nation where religion and government were separate? Maybe we were just taught that our founders knew better? Yet, here we are in 2015 when Christians clammer for spacial needs and also tax monies to support their schools (which are tax free institutions anyway), where Mormons own an entire State and use tax monies, both local and federal, to support their religious beliefs, where Jews now also have learned to "game" the system, along with all the others that regularly practice racism, sexism and intolerance in the name of God! <br/><br/>We have a presidential candidate and preacher, Mike Huckabee, who said of the serial child molester, John Duggar that "Good people make mistakes" and he continues to appear on the ballot and all of the TV news shows. Yet no one questions this?<br/><br/>At some point, our nation must begin to assume responsibility for the direction we have taken and begin a process of separation of religion from our politics or we may find ourselves in an even worse position than today. We condemn and are astonished by the wars around the globe conducted in the name of a God, and yet, here at home we are allowing the equivalent behavior to take seed. Can we be so ignorant of history?

You are just trying to minimize the damage, Obamacare will bankrupt the country, federal subsidies just mean a larger deficit, who pays for all this?  What about the failure of the electronic record keeping requirement...I recently went to a doctor who spent all his time on a computer instead of listening to the patient  The new health care is a disaster, just like the European models, we are not Europe, we value individual initiative!

Immigrated from China in 1992, and in 20 years has made that much to tear down a house and build one twice to three times the area, where is the money coming from? The total cost for this must be at least 1-1.5 million or so, nice country if you can make it here!

Getting kids out of failed public schools lorded over by the teachers’ union produces great results; who could possibly have guessed?<br/><br/>Providing equal educational vouchers to each student would instantly result in lots more schools opening to serve them. It would enable Catholic schools to keep their doors open. The schools would answer to parents for the quality of the product.<br/><br/>SEEDS isn’t new; NJSEEDS has been taking poor kids, removing them from public schools, sending them to some of the best private schools where – SURPRISE!! – they succeed. Ironically, it’s run by some of the most liberal folks around, few if any of whom would publicly be caught dead advocating for vouchers. Because as between the best interests of kids, and the interests of public employee unions, the latter inevitably wins.<br/><br/>(And many on the left don’t mind SEEDS, but recoil in horror at the idea that the schools which achieve the same results might be religious. Can’t have that.)<br/><br/>Education might be a public good, but that doesn’t require it to be provided by public employees. SEEDS demonstrates that you can get great results for lots of kids by doing precisely what conservatives advocate: getting them into a better educational environment.<br/><br/>Yes, some will fail; some always do. But they’re failing now, in appalling numbers at hideous expense. Vouchers won’t solve the problem for everyone. But they’ll produce better results for many, at lower expense for all. That is the very definition of success.

Milk the last glass of wine and linger? I never knew there was a "time's up" for customers too. If go to a restaurant with family or friends, and we are enjoying our time together, I am staying as long as I want. And if someone hints for us to leave (unless it is closing time), I will never return. I do not care about their reservation system. It is up to them to make it work without bothering the clients who go there to have a good time, not to be hurried up. If I want someone to tell me to rush, I'll go eat at my mum's!

Could it be, that with over 2/3 of students in private schools, that voters connected with private schools form the majority in this city? Seems like you're victimizing the victims of this situation even further. Why don't those working class (or less) people organize campaigns to get themselves elected, and then this wouldn't be a problem! Really? And what about the present board? Is their behavior acceptable in your eyes?

Seriously? Please show me links to serious resources providing evidence of the U.S. trying to be involved in regime changes in Ukraine! 

17353
You don't think Ukrainians (especially those on the Western side of the country) might have wanted to align more with Europe and not with Russia on their own? I mean the experience of the pro-European independence movements of the Hungarians, Czechs, Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians (to name a few) should tell you that not everything to do with being pro-democracy, pro-transparency is part of a CIA plot. As to the rebellion in Syria, this was hardly some smoothly orchestrated intelligence operation either! The Arab Spring (triggered in part by anti-CIA/NSA and often strikingly pro-Russian crusader Julian Assange) was all it took for that house of cards to start coming down. No doubt the U.S. is involved in some slice of the rebellion now, but to blame the chaos there on the U.S. is just too easy and mostly wrong.

"And why is the school district paying for transportation to private religious schools, anyway?!"<br/><br/>In New York State, public school systems are required by law to provide transportation (up to 15 miles) and textbooks to private school students.

Gender-segregated bussing?  How special!  To a  public school educator for nearly 40 years, this reads like sci-fi.  Is there no oversight?  How can a Democratic system allow Religions to take over PUBLIC education?

Rather than on nuclear weapons (NW), should emphasis on disarmament not be on 'Conventional Weapons'? -the varied forms of which destroy(ed) many hundreds of million lives since at least August 1945.<br/><br/>6 to 9th August 1945 saw NW's mercilessly used x2 on human beings. Then, only one national leader controlled it; and his personal safety was well in hand.<br/>But post-1945 and with multiple-countries possession, a subtle but most effective/efficient deterrence against NW's use is irrevocably in place.<br/>All leaders controlling NW's instinctively know that their very lives would be in imminent danger if they ever attempted a first use against others. The inevitable massive retaliation with NW's by the others and their indiscriminate destructive power ensures this. <br/><br/>(Verify the above facts in their non-use even during the notorious 1962 Cuban Missile crises; or the very many post-1945 wars; and severe 'empty nuclear war' threats/diplomatic nuclear disputes since 1945 -these, causing undue public anxieties.)<br/><br/>Nowadays, in only three most improbable scenarios could NW's be used: 1. A suicidal or mentally ill absolute leader in possession within a despotic regime; 2. Transfer to terrorist leaders with no fixed addresses; 3. Accidental use -the most unlikely because of effective controls.<br/><br/>However, 'Conventional Weapons' use in wars are so readily permitted! to destroy soldiers and populations well away from their (the leaders) presence. These are the weapons that need to be stopped!!

What type of blunders affect a candidates viability? <br/><br/>The ones that receive the most attention from the media! It doesn't matter if the reporting is accurate, as long as it's loud and persistent. The idea that "be authentic" is meaningful advice in the current climate is simply laughable. We've gone way beyond where authenticity even plays a role. Perhaps what Ms O'Donnell means is the appearance of authenticity?

Hmmm, so only those that were ignorant and overpaid for their house would get a principal reduction? That doesn't seem fair. How about letting the chips fall where they may?<br/>So, this article proposes that houses return to the overinflated bubble of 2007.<br/>Nonsense! Houses are overpriced, again,   just take into consideration land values and the actual cost to build.<br/>  If the Fed would stop this zero-interest nonsense, inflated property values would come down. Renters would see cheaper rent. AND, those that paid waaay too much for their house should be more careful next time.

Are you kidding?  Some Yeshivas do take the state ELA and Math exams and their results make the WORST public schools look good.  Take a look at how few students in the Yeshivas that take the state tests pass the exams.  And I'm sure the ones that don't even take the exam are far worse.  <br/><br/>Remember, the schools spending $15K per student include all the schools that DO teach the children with disabilities and special needs.  In East Ramapo, they have figured out a way to give that money to Yeshiva schools (which are doing a terrible job with all that money).  <br/><br/>By the way, private schools offer a good education in NYC for $40,000/year to students whose families ALSO pay for tutors whenever their child struggles (that despite being in very small class sizes).  Why do you assume that $15,000 is a lot of money?  Are you saying that private schools are robbing their rich parents blind?  And most of those private schools don't even have any costly special needs kids!  You must think rich parents are the biggest fools on earth to pay for private school.

Does Congress actually condone these practices?<br/><br/>Yes. And not only that it has been attempting to increase the number of these Visas, as has Obama. In addition the number has not decreased since the 2007 crash, as it was supposed to according to law, but increased. <br/><br/>Thank you Congress!

Gee, you mean Bill Gates laying off thousands and thousands of people while pushing for increased immigration of skilled workers isn't for the betterment of us all?<br/><br/>You mean the flat wages for tech workers for the past 16 years might somehow be related to cheap foreign labor, layoff of the most experienced (and older and most expensive) workers?<br/><br/>I heard that cheap foreign labor was supposed to "grow the economy." I heard it was supposed to "free up" American workers to take more "highly skilled jobs." I heard it was supposed to increase profits, which would allow companies to expand (ha!) and thereby create more jobs for more US workers<br/><br/>You mean that didn't happen? Gee, I wonder if the same thing could be applied anywhere else, like in construction or trucking or…no. Not possible, right?

How can Disney management sleep at night?  While I didn't have the humiliation of training my replacement or having my job taken by a legal immigrant, this kind of inhumane job loss was made popular by the banking industry.  One week after receiving a congratulatory letter from Countrywide/Full Spectrum for helping increase business, our entire customer service center was told our jobs were being moved to Arizona.  If you agreed to move, you would receive a bonus of $1500 toward moving expenses and a possible promotion.  If not, you had 3 months to find another job or be terminated.  Of course the people that moved ended up losing their jobs less then two years later when B of A took over and moved their jobs to yet another state.  Congress has got to get off the pot and close EVERY loophole in the visa lottery!

And why do any couples have more income?  Because they have chosen to be responsible about their sexuality.  In other words, girls who are smart enough to use birth control or abstain from sex until they are older will not be the ones having children at a younger age before they are through high school, college, or vocational school, thus ensuring that their maturity helps them be better parents able to not only care for their children's physical needs, but emotional ones as well.  Giving welfare benefits and setting up young girls in their own apartments only breeds more of the same.  The educated, true "do gooders," who have had their ideas and statistics applied through government programs, were not the ones with the answers, and it has taken 40 years for the reality of what isn't working to be heard.  Unfortunately, dismantling the welfare system will be hard to do if not impossible, so expect more children failing in school, and ending up in juvenile detention, foster homes, mental health care, all because we believe a lie that young single girls can affectively parent.  They can't!

How often do you really choose an airline based on service?  For business travelers in particular, the question is the hub near your home.  That's the airline that will have the most flights and destinations.  And you might as well load up on their miles/dollars since they have the flights you need.  (I hope my million-miler status maintains its value.  There I said it: yeah, I'm a million-miler and love the luggage tags!)

You can't afford apples in Manhattan? Take the bus or train down to Chinatown then (or walk - it's not that far). There are amazing, very inexpensive produce shops there. Or find an old-fashioned fruit/veg market (a so-called "Korean" market since so many are owned by recent Korean immigrants). Or go to Fairway. There's also a well-known inexpensive fruit place in Chelsea. Or maybe move to a less expensive neighborhood. Union Square has been very pricey since the 1980s. I think you are not trying hard enough!

What article did you read?!? Seriously. The one worker had received a stellar review. In fact, a CNET article on this issue revealed that all of the fired workers had received great reviews and many were expecting to be promoted.<br/><br/>They obviously had the skills needed to do the job.<br/><br/>Personally, I long for the day that we have a national bar exam. I'd love to see foreign lawyers flooding into America. Won't that be wonderful? In fact, let's start importing lawmakers, too. We can replace Obama with Merkel. <br/><br/>Why not? We're all replaceable. <br/><br/>On a serious note, this issue is about cheapness. That's all. Like most else in modern life, it's all about the money.

Want an affordable watch accurate to the second that doesn't need new batteries ever (or very rarely)?  Try a Citizen atomic wristwatch that recharges the battery with any form of light.  Some recent quartz wristwatches advertise accuracy to ± 10 seconds a year, and are quite stylish to boot.  These affordable wristwatches might not be heirloom timepieces but they sure keep great time!

Why not turn efforts to expanding the numbers of people who have valid IDs? Such IDs are useful for activities other than voting! Getting on a plane, for one. If some parts of the population are underrepresented, why not have campaigns to reach out to them and help them understand the forms of ID for which they are eligible and how to obtain them? That seems a much more productive exercise to me.

What's the matter Disney - run out of outsourcing opportunities, so now you're "insourcing"? You're right down the road from me; My family and I have spent a ton of money with you over the last 30 years, but no more. No more hotel rooms, park passes, clothing - not a single cent more. <br/><br/>This is about jobs and doing the right thing by your employees; not about your precious stockholders and executive bonuses. You could've added some of these HB-1 workers, instead of using them as replacements, if you were truly looking for innovation. You and your profit machine would've survived just fine. DISGUSTING!

As a junior developer with a graduate degree in the humanities and another graduate degree, in software engineering, very much in progress who is seeking to move into the ranks of senior-level technology work, what sort of message am I supposed to take away from this kind of journalism? (As others have pointed out, this hardly qualifies as the first time a company of Disney's prominence has treated its skilled tech workers like so much expendable deadweight.)<br/><br/>What am I supposed to think of a world in which literally no profession seems to offer a return on the investment required to enter it? Where's the incentive to invest in any career path? Why should we so furiously discard and disparage the arts and humanities in favor of the so-called "STEM" sectors when all the available evidence indicates that private employers don't value STEM-trained American workers any more than any other employed adult in other sectors; that they will dump said "desperately needed" high-skilled workers at the first sign of a cheaper alternative?<br/><br/>What am I supposed to think of a world that refuses to deal with pressing problems because the solutions aren't sufficiently "economical"? Speaking as an older millennial, I frankly don't care whether or not the solutions are economical; they need to be done, and now. Yes, it will cost a lot; no, taxpayers won't foot the entire bill so that corporations can continue to rake in profit without lifting a finger. Solve this problem, now!

Does anyone really care? By the time election day rolls around we are so numbed by the newspaper and television coverage, robo calls, mailings, tv commercials - aaarrrgh!!! This is such an awful waste of time and money - money that should be spent on education, arts, our roads and bridges, anything would be better than the embarrassment of our political campaign and election system. Is there another country in the world that has such a long lead time (and sees so much money spent) for an election?   

21111
How would you like it if the government kept a record of everyone who mailed you a letter or to whom you mailed a letter? Wouldn't that be the same as keeping a record of everyone you telephoned  or telephoned you?  Don't forget, all governments are naturally inclined toward tyranny. In the U.S., the constitution is our best defense against governmental tyranny. Use it!

On what logic is this statement based? This doesn't make remote sense. The forces of supply and demand are always applicable, regardless of any laws. It's completely nonsensical to argue that it "no longer qualifies as free market supply and demand." That's exactly what it is! Just because backwards France has decided they want to go against market forces to protect other drivers at does not mean that overall demand for taxis has diminished. The demand is (clearly) still there, and is obviously being met. The article states that these guys also pay taxes to the state, so it's benefiting France's pockets as well! They're just irrationally protecting traditional taxi drivers because the taxi drivers want to protect the amount of demand they have for their services.

From an educational standpoint, why do we keep teaching and training our youth in all sorts of academic/professional fields? What is the point of that?<br/><br/>This reality horror show reveals that education, experience, professionalism, and expertise are unnecessary when saving a few bucks on importing other desperate, educated, or capable of being trained workers from other parts of the world. Why are we sending our kids to school? Why pay and then flaunt higher education?<br/><br/>And if customer satisfaction is the aim, if I can't get a simple answer to a simple question, I'll drop that particularly savvy service or company without second thoughts.<br/><br/>I'm an immigrant myself, and this is not a rejection of immigrants but of the perversity of having to allocate so many resources to educating and training our kids for a future that belongs to these plutocrats looking to enrich their earnings, stock values, etc., in the name of the consumers (i.e., all the rest of us) by depriving everyone in the process of a decent, secure, ethical livelihood.<br/><br/>Please boycott Disney, Fossil and every other entity mentioned in this article! Please don't sell your children to their perverse delusions! They want to make money out of exploiting some chimeras, and it's in your hands to stop them!

Didn't Disney just announce another round of price hikes for visiting their parks, and a rate in advance of overall inflation?  (perhaps I'm mis-remembering).  I've worked with people here on H-1B visas before, and these were individuals (note!) hired to bring in exceptional talent, not as part of mass cost-cutting programs.  So I don't think that the program should be terminated, but it certainly looks like in needs to be reformed.

Whaaaat??? It's not all Obama's fault? Don't you remember that it's that Marxist (even though the repubs luv his free trade stance) Kenyan birth fraud who gave us Obamacare (even tho it's Mitt's program that he first promoted then ran away from)?<br/><br/>And the way Obama changed things to allow GE to record billions in profit yet pay no taxes, that allowed Mitt to pay only 14% to income tax. Wait? Obama isn't responsible for these things? Next thing you're going to tell me that it wasn't Obama who invaded Iraq!

Now why would Disney import foreign workers to replace American workers who have been required to train their replacements? Is it because the American workers are not capable? Not likely if they are required to train their replacements. Perhaps it has something to do with a company that is run by "bean counters" who are making up loss in profits by cutting out American workers in favor of cheap inexperienced foreign workers. Corporate American has no problem shipping work overseas to take advantage of lower wages. This move tops that by firing American workers who have to train their inexperienced foreign replacements. What Gall! Shame on Disney.

22044
It's the American way, isn't it? While other countries struggle to improve their economic standing, we are winning our self-imposed race to the bottom.<br/>My heart goes out to the workers who were laid off, and treated so poorly.<br/>Any humiliation belongs to those who did the firing, not the workers who were so abused.<br/>There is a reason UNIONS came to being in the first place. How long before citizens of this formerly great nation realize we need them NOW?!

Why is this allowed In America ?  Why ?   I will not take any family member of mine to Disney or buy any Disney products ?  Disney movies will go unwatched.  To destroy American lives by giving their jobs to H-1B Visas immigrants and to humiliate and dehumanize the American workers by making them train their replacement is outrageous. Obviously, the American workers were skilled or they wouldn't be used to train their foreign replacements...where is the ACLU ?  We have Jeb Bush running around giving speeches to raise the social security and Medicare age to 70 .... People in America in their 30 's and 40's can't keep their jobs due to being replaced by foreign immigrants in our own country. So how are 69 and 70 year olds going to find or keep their American jobs ... Jeb Bush! And you wonder why Bernie Sanders is drawing huge crowds and people are supporting him!  No one is looking out for American workers ! One of the big  tech companies in Silicon Valley told their HR department don't hire Americans  We have a president pushing for a bad trade agreement ... TPP... that ensures thousands if not millions of lost American jobs. The politicians actually plan on stealing funds from Medicare to give welfare to Americans losing their jobs because of TPP  ! And again, this why Bernie Sanders speaks to the American public....he gets it and cares !  I really feel we don't have an America anymore !

Does anyone care that 'rising inequality' is simply wrong?  Inequality is NOT rising!  Piketty himself has acknowledged that his data was wrong [see articles in Economist].  Inequality peaked around 1910, dropped steadily until the 1970s, and has been essentially flat since then.  Dr. James Schlesinger once said, "Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but no one should have his own facts!"

How many years have you been living in China?  I would suspect that Mr. Bao would have accumulated far more information about his own country than you have.  Yes, indeed, China has experienced a tremendous amount of economic growth over the past few decades but little of that growth has filtered down to rural communities where people are still living in caves (I've visited some of them!).  And, yes, corruption is ubiquitous in the upper echelons of society and government- no less than it is here. 

23599
Gee, Schneiderman's going to run against Cuomo in the primaries? He's got my vote!  The way I look at it, it's just a question of time before somebody indicts Cuomo for accepting payments he's not supposed to -- though I guess it will  have to be Preet Bharara instead of  Schneiderman.  I bet Cuomo would try to shut Bharara down, too, if he could.

This one had clever crosses on the STALA??ITES.<br/><br/>The across clues allow for:<br/>GAPS or CAPS<br/>MOIL or TOIL<br/>GUT or CUT<br/>ISMS or ISTS<br/><br/>Leaving only the positions of the words as the answers!  I remembered that a STALACTITE hangs tight to the top of the cave and a STALAGMITE might reach the top after centuries of dripping from the top.  Unfortunately GAPS instead of CAPS!

Donald, are you seriously equating how Americans handle their constitutionally guaranteed right to protest and free speech with China's? Can you imagine millions of Chinese angrily and publicly condemning their government officials like how Americans do with Obama and Bush? Give me a break! Get out of the country once in a while.

Like many others I wonder why being transgender brings out the most constrained, superficial and stereotypical views of gender? A 30 something starlet, primped, photoshopped into the male dominated culture's fantasy of what it means to be a woman. This is more like permanent cross dressing (so much emphasis on clothers!) than a truly female life and perspective. Caitlyn is Bruce's creation in more ways than one. And the resemblance to the lifestyle and fashion sense of Kim Kardashian is just creepy.

ummm - what about climate change? Instead of not eating almonds, how about looking for ways to reduce ways you pollute. Thank you. We here in Oregon are having a bit of an issue with the drought, too. I mean, sure, the sunshine is nice, but I wonder where my drinking water is going to come from is this keeps up! I say go ahead and eat those almonds...to fuel your bike ride!

Hunh? With what authority do you claim that women define gender distinctions? It's only in the well-post-industrial age that being the physically stronger sex (aka being male)  has not determined the majority of parameters regarding behavior and accomplishment. While I am completely comfortable with Caitlyn's (why the "y," how corny!) decision, I so agree with the Times' article stating that this is the high end of luxe indulgence. Do it, by all means, but don't claim a hero's trophy on the way.

garelick too has courage- to raise this question: how is the finding of a True Self so linked to the caricatures of Womanhood that are sexually objectifying ? How did a Hollywood pin up become someone's deepest gender identity ?<br/>While no one should face derision or stigma for living on the spectrum of femininity &amp; masculinitiy- how did plastic surgery become the courageous key to gender honesty &amp; individual freedom ?<br/>The feeling of being 'born into the wrong body' is complex. This too exists on a spectrum of unease. Many men &amp; women struggle to feel comfortable in their own skin; some folks never give it a thought. Muscularity, slimness, youthful glow, big or little breasts &amp; buttocks - there is a lot expected of plastic surgery that may not really involve 'courage.'<br/>Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing self-creation (as DMoses observed- an Olympic achievement!)--but maybe we have yet to understand what it means.

Have you ever heard about age of onset?<br/>Thombs and Osborn (2013) advocates that preventing or delay the age at first use of alcohol is the optimal way to reduce alcohol abuse and dependence in the future.<br/>Nobody is saying that alcohol must be forbidden, this is not the case.<br/>If they return the law to 18, adolescents may drink at 16 years old. Now, they may drink at 18.<br/>Research has documented that the early you drink, the higher the risk you have to become addict:<br/>14 years or younger you have 15.1% of chance to become addict<br/>15-17 you have 9.1% of chance<br/>18-20 you have 4.4% of chance<br/>21 or older you have 2.7%<br/>In other words, we are preserving the future, the integrity of our youth, keep them away from addiction, as best as we can<br/>Say NO to drinking at 18!!!

Have any of you eminent economists heard of an input-output model? The logic behind this type of economic model is that making things, including construction of new schools, requires inputs of  materials and services as well as labor. Not so different from needing flour and sugar to bake a cake. Similarly, production of each input generates demands for other materials and services as well as further labor inputs, and so on. Wages paid to workers at each stage support consumer expenditures, which in turn stimulate production of other goods and services. Empirical application of such models result in multipliers in the range of 1.5. Econometric models also support empirical estimates of multipliers in the same range.<br/><br/>The idea that everyone considers future tax increases before making economic transactions is sort of curious. Heirs of great family fortunes and hedge fund managers may actually think about taxes before purchasing new yachts. But most of us are more often engaged in grocery shopping or deciding whether to replace broken down cars that we need to travel to our jobs (if we still have one). Or picture a construction manager placing orders for concrete and 2x4s. Do we all consult tax accountants before making these transactions? I think not.<br/><br/>Honestly gentlemen! We would all benefit if you guys devoted more of your time and considerable skills to more realistic issues.

Who wrote this snarky review? Name? The original review that commenters refer to is a good, even-handed piece that projects the book as something interesting to read, maybe, if you are into this tranche of society. This unsigned hatchet job is clearly intended to suppress enthusiasm for the book which is probably flying out of B &amp; N. Who paid for this review, I wonder? This hatchet job seems to say that unless fully-fledged anthropology students with white coats and clip boards ascent to the Upper East Side and conduct their interviews with the full approval of the Institutional Review Board the work is without value. Ho ho! Looks like maybe this book is touching a particularly achey, guilty nerve.

How is it we are being taken in by occurrence of riots again?  Is this the forces of anarchy vs. the forces for stable government?      On the international level, the U.S. claims to be for 'stability'.  In actuality, the plutocrats haven't seemed to have cared a hoot about stability, as long as such a thing called that actually amounts to the rights of the big businesses they control retain freedom to 'operate'.  And that only means that those businesses can continue to rake in profits despite civilization itself ... coming to disaster.<br/>Since that seems alright with them in the Middle East [starting such follies as the war on Iraq (2003 -) ... and the fact the U.S. actually could have had peace for Syria!   ...  If only it hadn't kept to its 'red lines', at least to extent of demanding the Assad government give up ... (even though it of course can't)  ...<br/>Maybe the same modus operandi,<br/>and tour de force, is considered workable here in the U.S.<br/><br/>So as long as the powers that be in government are doing as the plutocrats say, things stay bad, like no jobs, while riots are acceptable too, the whole source of the protests, plus the protests on top of that, can keep going on ... now here in the U.S. as well as in the Middle East and anywhere else the 'neocons' and other perpetrators of these evils want it to happen.

WHY are you acting like this is "NEWS"?????  This has been standard practice in business since the 1980's!!  <br/><br/>Replace competent, skilled AMERICAN workers with illegals/aliens who work for HALF THE WAGE you do, and ARE NOT granted company benefits unless they are naturalized.   And these "replacements" have NO clue about anything, including speaking English, understanding English, knowing anything about American culture/manners/etiquette.......they are just here to infiltrate and take over Americans' jobs!<br/><br/>Get ready for it, because this is going to be MAJOR standard practice all across the board.  <br/><br/>You can thank your corrupt, cowardly government for this.

To the writer: don't you think that a woman should feel free to choose which type of woman she is or should be? I am a professional woman (science professor), wearing sensible shoes and clothes, fitting the expectations of my community. I chose this community.  Can you imagine what would happen if a woman scientist showed up in really tight, sexy clothes to give a talk at a scientific conference? God forbid!  So, there are many different types and stereotypes of womanhood in our society.  Ms. Jenner chose one of them. Who are you or we to judge?  I do not feel that, as a woman, I have to fit the stereotype portrayed by Ms. Jenner, hence I feel totally free to respect her choice. I feel that your piece is too judgemental, too self-righteous.

The new definition of heroism and feminism is this?  I guess in today's "anything goes" freak show of dumbed down morals and acceptance you are correct and to blame.  Wonderful!  Brought to you by the same media idiots that brought us "funemployment" and "staycations"  to cover up for Obama's incompetence.<br/>Political correctness, the ever pervasive bane of society continues to spread here and there like a virus....hamstringing us when it comes to calling Caitlyn Jenner "abnormal" and a radicalized Islamist terrorist, a radicalized Islamic terrorist by an idiot at the Times or the White House.  From the front of a "Wheaties" box" to "Fruit Loops" is where you and Caitlyn are taking us...not to mention Barack Obama who has evolved in his thinking...not "flipped flopped".  Bravery? Bruce...no I am sorry, Caitlyn is a conservative!  LOL!

What is wrong with the American people??? Yes, I include myself! There is a solution to this craziness. DO NOT PATRONIZE ANYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY THAT TEARS DOWN THE FABRIC OF WHAT WAS ONCE A GREAT COUNTRY!!!<br/>We complain about all of it and do nothing. We have been losing jobs to these foreigners for many years. It doesn't seem to matter to anyone unless you are personally affected. I never took my children to Disney parks because I couldn't afford. We don't go to sport events because they are nothing like they used to be. Enormous amounts of money is paid to sports player, actors, etc. and if we want to attend, we get taken to the cleaners.<br/>The media tells us how much it will cost for a family of four to go to games, and Disney and like, and we just dish it out. Is someone putting something in the water? Is there nothing else to do in life but give our hard earned money to leeches. We know as certain as the sun will rise everyday, the rich always want more. And we give it to them. Please find something else to do. Find and elect people who will do what they say, 'Listen and do what they are elected to do'. There was a time our country did not take invasions from other countries lightly. We are still being invaded. Wake up folks!<br/>"THEY'RE HERE!"

Seriously? The simple fact that Rick Perry's handlers actually convinced him he has a chance bears some deep thinking: this guy is truly, simply out of his mind. The whole glasses thing is absolutely comical. But the fact that he believes the voting public has no short term memory, that somehow we want more Rick Perry. This announcement is stunning in its own belligerent way. What a gift!

Really, Stacee - all camps everywhere have excellent supporting materials?<br/><br/>Some do - the daycamp I used for my son for the last several years; they were a paragon of excellent organization and continuous improvement. Comes with being run by one extended family for *decades*.   But that wasn't my experience everywhere.<br/><br/>And there the gotchas in the background a camp doesn't see unless the parent brings it up, like the medication that needs to be provided ahead of time, but the refill policy the parent needs to deal with is strict about intervals.   And the physical that can't be performed (or the parent must pay out of pocket) because the previous years' physical was less than 365 days previous to any date acceptable to the camp.  (and, pertaining to after school care, the school district transportation department's policy that a parent needs to have the forms in for bus transportation - the April of the previous year!)  And other suchlike traps.  Every agency we deal with has policies, boy do they have policies.  They clash.   This article is just perfect in bringing out the humor and frustration of it.

AACNY , haven you been alive during 2008? <br/><br/>This country's  economy saved from great depression v 2.0!!!<br/><br/>You  GOP lovers really thinking that playing down  the  significance of 2008 great recession makes  people (not only  in USA but all over the world) will forget what happened. <br/><br/>Obama's  presidency can be  summarized  and  concluded one very important action;  USA  compared to  EU  recovered from 2008 recession fairly quickly and  economy  put back on the rails again.  That is  more than enough for  Obama Presidency. <br/><br/>In fact if you look at  last 15 years of GOP political actions  (white house and  Congress) you cannot see single  positive accomplishment but very serious failures. there is a list below.<br/><br/>1- Underestimating 9/11 threats<br/>2- Invading Iraq  with wrong premises<br/>3- Spending  enormous  tax payers money to Iraq  democracy<br/>4- Underestimating housing bubble and  mortgage  schemes<br/>5- Caught unguarded to 2008 Recession due to ongoing Afghan and Iraq wars<br/>6- Literally not cooperating to efforts to recovery from the 2008 recession<br/>7- Taking stand with 1% instead of  majority  Americans.<br/><br/>This is what GOP did last 15 years give me your list what did GOP accomplished last 15  years.. I  am really wondering what GOP did?

Why stop at inappropriate cheering at graduation? I've seen women clipping and painting their toenails on the Washington DC Metro.  Off with their toes!  But let's give some slack to parents who perhaps never graduated themselves and can't hold back the pride and joy they have at that moment when their son or daughter reaches that point.  As a civilization, we should stand up and cheer with them.

Didn't this newspaper very recently publish a positive review of the book, "Galileo's Middle Finger", written by Alice Dreger?  It describes the anti-empiricism at the core of the transgender movement, and the violent, unethical tactics used by that movement to silence scientists who dare not toe their line!  <br/><br/>NYT, your reporting on this issue has been very one-sided and the implications of the agenda you are pushing are disturbing.

A high school graduation is a 'sacred ceremony'? Maybe the ACLU should get involved over the Mississippi school officials practicing some kind of official religion. After all, it was only about a year back when some kid in  grade school was sent home and suspended for a few days when she or he said "God bless you" to another kid after that kid sneezed, this because the kids had been told that they could not introduce religious concepts into the classroom! I might have written here "Oh my God!" in relation to both these cases, but I am now afraid to test the tolerance of the powers-that-be at the secular New York Times. What the hell is happening to this country? (Oh, does a small-letter 'hell' denote a religious belief in a place most of us would rather not visit? Just asking. I have to be so careful, you know, even without living in Mississippi. Oy!)

Why would anyone in their right mind want to board a plane any earlier than they have to in order to get to their destination?  It does not matter what seat you are in it is still a metal tube with bad air and lost baggage.   Early boarding and all of the other gilt has no impact on getting from point A to point B.  If you want status.. board late and hold the plane!

I agree it was probably the teacher thinking "hmm, charity for autism, who could possibly be against helping autistic kids?" But unfortunately, as we see, it's not always so simple. Look at Komen- so many people see the pink ribbon and everyone knows Komen is synonymous with "beat cancer!" and who could possibly be against that? Except Komen also has issues that would make a lot of people uneasy. Heck, even a food pantry might be problematic, if it's related to a religious organization. Schools that want to teach kids about the value of charity and community involvement should just fundraise for school. It's needed, good for the community, and I can't imagine anyone objecting to raising money for their own child's school.

What is the difference between multiracial and white? Often very little. Too many fools seem to think that all "whites" are racially "pure" and mixed-race people are only exotic members of the non-white groups. News flash! There is nothing new about being both white AND of racially mixed ancestry. Also, Caucasian genes are NOT the 98 pound weaklings of the human race. Many people look totally white but have a parent or grandparent who is not white. No big deal, folks! It's amazing that those dumb Americans who buy the idea that the black woman in "Imitation of Life" could produce a perfectly white daughter are nevertheless willing to throw a hissy fit over a supposedly "pure" white actor or actress playing a character who is not "pure white."

Just what part of "Secret" does the NYTimes not understand?  We are under the most sophisticated levels of cyberattack on an almost daily basis.  The Internet knows no boundaries, so the complaint that the components of the that system that were accessed were "on American soil" is a meaningless distinction, designed solely to arouse the readership when its technical significance is zero.<br/><br/>That that traitor, Edward Snowden first disclosed the information does not absolve you from legal responsibility for its wider dissemination.  Anyone passing on information they know to be classified, no matter how it came into their possession, is in violation of the law.  And, in my opinion, should be punished.  Of course, if the reporters who participated in this criminal act were to be pursued by the DOJ, you'd be bleating "First Amendment!  First Amendment!" as if that absolves you in advance from obeying any law.<br/><br/>Will you be satisfied only when America is blind, deaf, and defenseless against onslaughts be its enemies?

By the way,  does anyone remember how this all got started?  Back in about<br/>1978-79 the airlines were trying to attract customers, particulalry business customers.  So for a brief while they had a program that when you checked in<br/>for your flight,  the ticket agent would hand you a check for $50.  Not a flight voucher,  but real spendable money.  The beauty was that while it was typical that a corporate travel dept was paying for the original ticket,  the cash went to the actual flyer.  That was nice.  But then the IRS got involved with determining whether that should be considered taxable income,  and when the accountants in the corporate travel departments wised up to what was going on  ( it took them a few months )  they pressured the airlines to stop doing the cash refunds.  So having opened up the can of worms, the airlines scrambled to find some other way to reward travelers that would not cause tax problems or issues with travel departments.  Hence,  the airline loyalty clubs.<br/>This is the absolute truth...and not many people recall this.  Check with a few other old geezers who have been doing this for a long, long, time. !!

The more you fly, the more elite you are? Maybe not.<br/><br/>But flying with perks such as bigger seats, better service and nicer food, does ease the stress of travel. And that is why elite status matters when flying.<br/><br/>Still, everyone flies on the same plane, to the same destination, whether in first, business or coach.<br/><br/>And the airlines would prefer that you spend more dollars on air travel than other things, so they will keep 'rewarding' frequent fliers with elite and other such status.<br/><br/>As they say after you land, we hope you enjoyed your flight and look forward to seeing you onboard again soon. Have a nice day!

How long will ordinary Americans pay $500 dollars or more for air travel just to be herded like cattle, fed like toddlers and treated like peons? Delta seems like they will eventually establish a 1% club and bus the rest of us, in steerage , to our destinations. Good luck with that!

Think about it this way - who make the most money from a sick patient?  Answer:  doctors.  Who makes the most money from a healthy patient?  Answer:  insurance companies.  Without insurance companies you'd be paying a heck of a lot more for your healthcare!  Our sytem is Fee For Service, meaning, the more you consume in healthcare, the more money the hospital makes.  The insurance company, as a result, pays for those expenditures.  The insurance company has every incentive to keep the cost of care low.

So why did I spend 50+ years at a major research university teaching and researching in the biomedical sciences and with some 100 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows if they are going to be replaced by cheaper imports?  The U.S. continues to proclaim the importance of science, scientific literacy and STEM education but the news from Disney and all those other companies clamoring for more H-1B visas will do nothing to encourage US students to enter these fields. And our legislators are arguing ( doubtless persuaded by generous "campaign contribution") for more of these visas? I despair!

You know what happens if the less important revenue stream stop coming ?!<br/>The plane does not take off. At the start of he Montgomery Bus Boycott (Dec '55 - Dec '56) the bus company thought nothing of the boycott by the Black community (they thought nothing of the Black community either..). A year without the Blacks (who refused to sit in the back of the bus any longer) brought the bus company to the brink of bankruptcy. I think that Black ridership was not more than 15%. Still - the buses could not run without it.<br/>There are a few parallels here.

I agree with you, Bruce, but given what passes for entertainment on tv and in the movies, are we really surprised? Dressing and acting "over the top" is what our culture is all about these days. If every person doesn't get their 30 seconds of fame by hooting and hollering  during important events such as graduations, weddings, birthday parties, etc . when cameras are rolling, then it's no fun! After all, our culture tells them everyone is special and they should just be themselves, so they do so in the most classless, obnoxious, selfish ways possible. Decorum is so old fashioned! The worst is when our national anthem is played before a public event- they don't shut up even for that, and then they hoot and holler when it's over, as if that makes up for their lack of respect when it's being played. Humility and being understated don't play well if you want attention paid to you, and that's what rude behavior is saying-"Look at me". Disgusting.

Why is the media again portraying soccer as "not qualified enough" as a sport in America? The MLS doesn't attract fan interest? Wow, really? How is that possible when I went to an NYCFC soccer game a few weeks ago and there were more people in attendance than at a Yankees vs Royals game I attended just last week? AND remember now, NYCFC plays in Yankee Stadium! Fact is, Yankees average season attendance has gone downhill since around 2008. Even after their 2009 World Series win their fans have stayed away. Gee, I wonder why?<br/><br/>In 1979, the NASL had more people attending NY Cosmos games at Giants Stadium than the NY Giants did... IN THEIR OWN STADIUM! The NASL folded due to mismanagement but shockwaves were definitely felt by team owners from the NFL, NBA and MLB. They realized profits were down and a huge reason was because they were losing fans to soccer. So they quickly scrambled and began hiring consultants and began rumors that soccer was not "American." This time, however, it seems quite unlikely it will go away like the NASL did in the 1980s. Stop saying Soccer is "not qualified." What about ice hockey? Who's gung-ho about watching Tampa vs Chicago in the Stanley Cup? The Super Bowl vs the World Cup? Does anyone in Europe know who won the World Series? I mean, it is the WORLD series, right? And , OH YEAH, why would the Yankees organization invest $100 million into NYCFC and soccer in NY? Look into why McDonald's invested in Chipotle; if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!

The NYT realizes women are a protected class, correct?  And that the protections provided women are based on sex, not gender? Being a protected class suggests that there is an oppressor class from whom women need protection.  Giving the oppressor class (men) the power to "identify" into the protected class (and enjoy/destroy the benefits of that class - such as separate space in prisons and bathrooms and military barracks, separate colleges, separate sports teams) infringes on the protections given women based on the fact that they are oppressed and threatened by men.  I do think it is comparable to say Caucasian people could "identify" as African American to gain access to some of the protections we rightfully provide based on race.  NYT would NEVER push a transracial agenda. Ever. Its unquestioning cheerleading of the transgender movement, with no nuanced analysis of the complicated sociological implications of their position, is an insult to the journalistic integrity they repute to possess.<br/><br/>Further, arguing that a woman is "made" by putting on "feminine" stereotypes, taking hormones and getting surgery (but not always, as it is increasingly clear many transgender "women" maintain their penis and testicles by choice!), erases the biological reality of women, and the struggles those biological realities represent when pushed up against the strictures of a misogynistic society.

Trillion dollar coin??  Do you not understand the meaning and purpose of metaphor?  It was never a serious idea, just a concept, to illustrate to non-economists the absurdity of the debt-ceiling/fiscal cliff debacles, generated by the GOtP.  As for the 'growth of the Internet will slow'...here's Krugman: <br/><br/>"First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker [....] the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question.  And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point -- that they're confusing technology with monetary economics."<br/><br/>Read more: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-internet-quote-2013-12#ixzz3bxqqZvwA" title="http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-internet-quote-2013-12#ixzz3bxqqZvwA" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-internet-quote-2...</a>

What about MLS? Been around for 20 years and is more popular than NHL (higher average attendance, more TV viewers). Time to change the "4 major sports" to 5! That is, if we still think hockey is a major sport...

Manufacturing? Really? Globally, manufacturing involves some of the lowest labor skill and least value added of any non-agricultural sector of the economy this side of tourism. In the U.S., manufacturing jobs pay wages near the national average for all employment, and it's only that high because manufacturing includes a few elite industries:  aerospace, telecom, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Does anyone really want Americans to work in textile factories again and compete with Bangladeshi workers -- heck, even China got priced out of that industry. Finally, how precisely would government spending possibly have any impact on our manufacturing? By bribing assembly plants to move here the way S. Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama did with Japanese and German auto makers at over $1 million per job!? That's outright blackmail that most other nations prohibit but we cannot due to states rights trumping interstate commerce.

Lol, how exactly, if the "enemy" knows our "spying secrets", will that give them an advantage? I guess they would have to stop targeting the U.S.A. in malware and phishing schemes for fear they would be tracked, or maybe China would be too afraid to use "The Great Cannon" again. Oh, the humanity! Explain how a person could avoid every internet entry point into the Unites States because they simply know it's there. The "enemies" either already know or assume someone is listening. Complete transparency, in this case, does no harm.

As in 1884?  Iowa was new in 1846 so...wow, I know it's not polite to ask someone's age but, here goes:  How freaking old are you?!  The Guinness Book has a page waiting for you, my friend.

So is this what they mean when they talk about tax breaks for "job creators?"  "Happiest Place on Earth?"  What about their CEO pay?  Corporate America is destroying our economy.  They pay off Congressmen and women.  I can't believe nothing is being done about this.   As a precondition for severance many corporations are making people sign a "Shhh!" form.  Why would that be needed if nothing being done is unethical?   Because what they are doing is unethical and bad for our nation if this is allowed to go unchecked.  <br/><br/>It will spread to other industries. Reading about this disgusts me. I've heard terrible things about them before (my neighbor was let go from their studio in Burbank).  They don't care about loyalty, it's all short sighted bean counters, greed, avarice and a governance that allows it.

What could be possibly wrong with this action? Liberal Progressives have been demanding more diversity in the American workplace and are presently campaigning for the Presidency on the preposition that alien labor is good for America. Fire Americans bring in the foreigners. <br/><br/>Amnesty to all illegals and to ... with the American worker, vote Democrat!

Does anyone else remember a scandal in New York in the 60s, when one of the major fashion magazines -- I think it may have been Harper's Bazaar -- inadvertently published a cover and cover-article featuring a model who, it was later discovered to the horror of the publishers, was not a woman but the photographer's boy-friend? As I recall, the costumes he wore had cowls, which covered up his tell-tale Adam's apple, and long sleeves. There was a great and amusing scandal when the truth came out! Plus ca change... except in this case, the clothing is far more revealing.

Honestly, we're trying to have a serious "intellectual" discussion about a publicity gimmick? We've been punked again. Score another one for the Jenner-Kardashian juggernaut. The American public and culture? Another goose egg.<br/><br/>Better pay up big time for spots on the E! reality show, advertizers. Rubes of all ages, incomes and formal education levels and degree "prestige" will be flocking to watch in droves.

Did you ever play the Gestapo game when you were a kid? "What is your name?" Reply with your name. "You lie!" Again and again.<br/><br/>The most pernicious aspect of government sweeping up every iota of your digital presence is that entirely harmless "dots" can be connected by an official who is convinced they represent a "signal" that you are plotting something terrible. This is akin to wedding parties being blown up by drones, innocent people being tortured for months or years on the basis of mistaken identity, and is in addition to malicious action by government officials to "neutralize" their political enemies or criminalize dissent, both of which have ample precedents in political dirty tricks and infiltrating peaceful organizations exercising First Amendment rights.<br/><br/>Blinding oneself with upside and ignoring downside is a terrible way to make policy.

Philly's only seventh? I grew up with a father who dragged his sons and daughters to every Phillies home game he could, and insisted that we all join him on Sundays around the campfire of a blaring TV to watch some kind of heartbreaking effort by the Eagles. Despite all evidence to the contrary, he never lost faith. And even after all these years in NYC, and a sad trip to Jacksonville to watch the Eagles lose the Super Bowl, I still love those teams. When the Phillies finally won the World Series my phone rang off the hook. Friends from all over the country called with congratulations, and wished he'd lived to see the day. On Sundays, the background sounds of an Eagles game still means that my Dad's in the house. That's not losing in my book. Go Phillies! Fly Eagles Fly! And thanks, Dad.

What?  Da Cubs don't count?<br/><br/>We do not suffer?<br/><br/>It is true we have the Blackhawks, the Sox, we remember fondly the great Bulls and even the 1985 Bears.<br/><br/>Of course, we Bears fans are in a category of suffering all our own.<br/><br/>But surely the Cubs fans deserve some kind of award!  <br/><br/>On the other hand, we expect to lose:)

Wait, what?<br/><br/>MORE "secret" justice department memos saying highly questionable government activities are legal? What's the point of a secret legal opinion? It's like "The Doomsday Machine." If you keep it secret its whole reason for existing becomes moot.<br/><br/>Secret memos, a secret FISA court that issues secret rulings. And Bamaand Diane Feinstein defending them at every step Wow!<br/><br/>Add that to an NSA that didn't even see ISIS being created and a whole host of international and national (Boston Marathon?) terrorism that went undetected and what you have is Obama handing nbridled power to an incompetent government agency.<br/><br/>Like others, I voted for Obama twice believing he would deliver the open and honest and accountable government he kept promising.<br/><br/>Instead, he cloaks his decisions in secrecy, prosecutes wars that were lost a decade ago, continues to violate the Constitution at every available opportunity, and has moved my country by huge leaps toward becoming a police state.<br/><br/>That will be his legacy: He will rank among the most mediocre presidents in our history. Very sad.

Are you suggesting that these chemicals should be tested on animals so that humans are not the "guinea pigs"?  Please make sure that your readers are aware of the amazing technological breakthroughs that have made testing fast, cheap, reliable, and most importantly, do not test on animals!  For more information related to this I would recommend a wonderful website:  <a href="http://www.caareusa.org" title="www.caareusa.org" target="_blank">www.caareusa.org</a>  which stands for Citizens For Alternatives to Animal Research and Experimentation.  We can be safer and animals do not have to suffer for it!!!!

A lack of a sexual desire, a disease, a medical condition? NO! It is just physiological like in getting old or being post-partum. To subject yourself to a drug with questionable effects but with known, confirmed risks of hypotension, fainting, nausea and dizziness which could result in death is downright foolhardy. And I am not coming from a sexism angle. Ditto for men too! The viagras and cialis have put men, especially older men in harm's way. Dying from a myocardial infarction is real. Ah! The vanity of humans trying to get the elixir of youth and immortality!

Why does the hospital industry escape your ridicule?  CEO salaries are just as high, profits are based off of increased utilization, increased admissions!  If you're healthy they lose, how do you not lament against these guys, or at least the system that allows them to get away with this?  Check out insurance profit margins, even for the big for-profits.  They are just not that big.  <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6089693/health-care-facts-whats-wrong-american-insurance" title="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6089693/health-care-facts-whats-wrong-american-insurance" target="_blank">http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6089693/health-care-facts-whats-wrong-americ...</a>  Read #5 on that list!

Will Disney shareholders expect to get better performance out of these highly skilled workers? Of course! All of the one billion people in India are geniuses - just contact one of the overseas call centers if you doubt me.<br/>   Actually it may be difficult to contact these worthies, since callers will probably be greeted by artificial "intelligence".

What a world, huh?<br/><br/>A narcissistic huckster spends a bundle to play dress-up for an international audience, and the majority of commenters gush "you go, girl!"<br/><br/>A rich, successful woman shares her unexpectedly universal human feelings about grief, loss and the struggle to get through each bereft minute, and urges us to remember those who do not have her privilege and connections but must try to survive the same crushing despair without help, and the majority of commenters snarl "who asked  you?"<br/><br/>Thank God I think I had the healthier reactions, each time.

Making the graduation ceremonies serious and solemn events--how dare they?  How dare the parents who want to see and hear their child be upset when a cheering section for someone makes that impossible!<br/><br/>Sure, it is a cultural thing--like shutting up during a moment of silence or the Star Spangled Banner at a stadium.  Perhaps the senior class should meet and decide -- perhaps they could have a baccalureate ceremony for those who think that a graduation should be, well, CEREMONIOUS, and then another graduation ceremony, where each graduate is introduced by a DJ with as much yelling and screaming as wanted.  <br/><br/>Sort of like that awful wedding trend.

Why can't consumers decide for themselves if they want to take a chance that an Uber driver isn't as "trained" or "professional" or even insured as a regulated Taxi?  If you want 100% security, take the taxi - they aren't going out of business even if Uber is completely unregulated. There is a place for both in the market. As an Uber user for 2 years including trying it out as a driver for a few months just to see what that was like, I'm biased toward the service, it is amazing. <br/><br/>Open an app, press a button and private car shows up to take you anywhere for a competitive price - OMG, shut that down, ce un outrage!<br/><br/>Adults can make intelligent decisions, let the market breathe a little bit, France, you might be shocked of the net benefits.

"How dare this Indian family dream of buying a car? Take the bus! Let them wallow in poverty so that we can gaily go on with our lifestyle!"<br/><br/>This is actually a smear. I've never known anybody in the US--including the very wealthy--with this sort of childish attitude; in fact, I think the attitude problem is yours since if you would actually talk to most anybody in the US, you'd find that they only want Indians to have the same opportunities we have. <br/><br/>And you can't deny that large numbers of Indians and Chinese have moved to the US (also Canada and Europe) to improve their lives; often they do much better than the native born. Personally, I welcome them.

Why not walk?  Paris is a gorgeous city!  <br/><br/>Or take the world-class Metro!  That's what a first-class First Wold City has to offer.<br/><br/>Why does everyone need to take (pollution-spewing) cars?  NOT the path to the future!

If the conscious mind wants more sexual pleasure with one's partner, and the subconscious mind says, "No, it's not right, it's not safe, so I have to shut your desire down," would it be wise to override that with a pill? Wouldn't it be wiser to investigate what is going on in the subconscious mind via psychotherapy, and resolve the internal conflict properly? If you simply override powerful forces in your subconscious, they can strike back at you!<br/><br/>We are addicted to the idea of a new shortcut. But more often than not, it's a delusion. Almost always, the 'long cut' turns out to be the shortest effective cut.<br/><br/>But our society's level of psychological sophistication is abysmal. So billions will be wasted on this pill, while the real problems it is supposed to magically solve will never actually be resolved.

And, who will diagnose this horrible epidemic of sexually uninterested women? Probably some men, similar to the ones pushing it through the FDA right now! More sex for THEM is the motive! As usual! kidding aside...truly- I agree with magala46-must there be a pill for everything? The "industry" spends more time on sex pills and soft drink flavors than they do on real science and real food laws.

Are you serious?  Southwest nickel and dimes you because you have to pay extra for an early assignment of your boarding number and they do nothing to stop people saving seats for the others they are flying with, who have later boarding letters and numbers because they did not pay the fee.  Then they have these over the top flight attendants who want you to move so fast to get a seat that you could trip or be trampled.  And, how do they figure this little lady on a flight I was on who appeared about 80 yeArs old can be seated in the exit row and pull in that he exit window if necessary?  Nuts!<br/><br/>Not to mention that they are the airline whose flight attendants would not let a woman get help for her husband who texted her that he was suicidal because they needed her to put her phone away.  And they never told the captain who could have alerted ground personnel to get help to the man.  Oh, yes, the man committed suicide while his wife was in flight.  Don't tell me about Southwest...

States are laboratories of democracy or lap dogs of multinational corporations? Most states tax corporate income. Can anyone name a state that has adopted mandatory worldwide combined reporting - the fairest and best state method of taxing corporate income? Tested three times and approved three times by the US Supreme Court in 1983 and 1994  (Container Corp. Barclays Bank and Colgate-Palmolive cases) by votes of 5-3 (Justice Stevens did not participate), 7-2 and 9-0! So why have most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting - better called watered-down or skim milk combined reporting - where "overseas business organizations" (foreign subsidiaries and foreign parents) are excluded for a state's tax base? Who are the biggest beneficiaries? Foreign based multinationals with US subsidiaries. Why, because the US profits that they shift overseas are not repatriated - no repatriation with a foreign parent. Zero state profits, zero state income taxes. We have met the enemy and he is ...our state legislators.

@CCC<br/>What?! No thumbs down. Oh well, I'll just have to write. What a foolish comment. Your response is not at all on point. 'Set in their ways'? When you work in the tech field and are learning computer languages and other technologies? I don't believe that's being set in their ways. Yes, I suppose a percentage of the population and may be higher for older, would be so. But, don't you think this has to be taken on a case by case basis, and not issue a blanket statement such as yours? So every man/woman for themselves? Ok, so why don't they say so? Survival of the fittest, yes! I'm for that, but what makes you think that an older worker is unfit? Or that they don't deserve a higher salary. I think people should be compensated what they're worth, regardless of age. Market price? check too, yes, I'm for that as well. The problem is that the people in management more often than not have no clue how to measure one's skills, they only vote in and out considering money and not what value an employee brings. This is due to incompetence, gross negligence and arrogance on the part of the people in charge. Wait... what? you believe they deserve to get paid 300 times what we get paid? Ok, that's another story, better left for another time. It's a bit late....

What can one person do about massive government overreach?  Most would say not much.  After all, what can I do?  If I do what I should, I will be a troublemaker, lose my privileges, and become outcast.  And nothing will change,  Too big, too rich, too powerful.<br/><br/>Then one man, hired to guard and care for the Tree of Secret Knowledge, instead risks all to reveal some of its darkest secrets.  And so we are cast out of our Eden of Innocence into a real world of our own making.  One person acts in honesty and love for his country and for everyone else.  John Savage in the Forest of Mirrors.  And the Red Queen screams "Sentence first and verdict afterwards!  Off with his head!".<br/><br/>We are told Citizenfour swore an oath.  Did that oath, like those of our Congress, Judges, and Presidents, commit him to 'preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution'?  If so, Edward, well done!

Oh, apparently, it would be much better to get an online "customer service" from Bangladesh/India instead of a professor for your academic studies and career recommendations? ?  Hahahahahaha...  You definitely NEED an education!

Oh, so you IMAGINE that professors just walk into a classroom and<br/>start teaching "outta nowhere" and without any preparation or dealing with<br/>assignments, or with student advising or with curriculum revising or any other<br/>professional obligations?  Well, that is really stupid!  You certainly know nothing about professional teaching.  Do some research before talking your nonsense.

Really Mr Little?  When was it that Mr Snowden advocated for the Russian govt?  (He even makes a poke at Russia in this piece)  You have clearly missed the continuing result of his actions.  The US gov would like nothing better than bring him home, lock him up, and silence his voice....which is exactly what will happen the minute he steps on US soil.  Wake up!  He's done and continues to do you a great service in protecting your freedom and privacy, no matter where he resides.

A post-terror generation ? Huh? ISIS is the terrorist organization for this generation. What planet is this man on! Obama is issuing warrant less actions against hackers now. This man/boy Snowden should be prosecuted.

So a guy who did not graduate from college, who loves Ann Rand, and who is pretty much a puppet of the Koch brothers, has the bright idea that he should appoint a bunch of his friends and donors to control tenure and curriculum?<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be a bigger savings to for Wisconsin just to close down the University and print up enough copies of Anne Rand for every citizen? Monies saved from ending higher education could go the Job Creators as tax relief for the one per cent. <br/><br/>This Scott Walker will make a terrific president. He Stood up to the unions and now he's standing up to the professors! He is tough!

Is this in the military budget of 540 Billion? Doubt it. I don't see it in the FY 2015 Defense Budget analysis.  The article says the FBI is handling the case.  Further, we really have no idea what the DoD is spending 540 billion on--that amount doesn't need to be increased, it needs to be accounted for!

Why don't we increase the minimum wage to a million? The demand will be through the roof! Everyone will be driving Ferraries and Mazeraties! Everyone will own a house or two! Unfortunately there is a thing called supply - you fix supply and increase demand and prices will rise. Economy is driven by both, not just by demand.

How about a new news network that reports news proportional with the things that are killing us? We could call it "Body Count News" - an edgy, catchy title. Sure, there would be a lot of stories about heart disease, cancer, car crashes, etc., but these are things that are killing us! BCN (Body Count News) would save lives by focusing our attention on the greatest threats to American lives, as confirmed by statistics.

Did anyone really expect that the defense industry and the politicians who live to support it and use "national security" to win elections were going to fold up their tents and go home after the collapse of the Soviet Union? Not a chance. They had to find a new mortal threat or they would have been out of business. W tried Saddam and that worked for a while, but you can only invade so many countries run by despots. Wait! Stateless terrorists! The perfect enemy. They're everywhere, you can never get rid of them all, and to top if off they wear funny clothes, chop people's heads off, practice a different religion, and don't look like us. Voila! We have found the enemy, the one thing this country can never do without.

How do the voters of Wisconsin feel about Walker?  Are they happy with his leadership?   All voters have to realize that there are consequences to their actions.  Presidents choose Supreme Court justices who are in for life.  The consequences of their decisions impact the entire country generations after the passing of those who chose them in the first place.  Governors establish certain precedents which can be hard to dislodge.<br/><br/>Remember Nixon who ignited the silent majority?  His call for "Peace with honor" prolonged the Vietnam War causing how many more additional deaths.  There was a lot of honor expressed by watching people trying to hold onto the departing helicopters.  Reagan with his smooth charm convincing Americans that cutting taxes was the answer.  It took a while for that to wreak havoc on our economy.  Bush I and II have done incredible damage to the U.S.  Remember those who voted for Nader in 2000.  Look who we got with of course a little help from the Supreme Court.  <br/><br/>Christie the pompous fool actually thinks that he can be POTUS, and sad to say he might be right.  Americans, look to yourselves, you are to blame!  (at least too many of you).

Giving away digital TV's to get votes?! Sounds like the Democrat party that we have here in the United States. Remember ACORN, the den of jailbirds/crooks working for the Democrat Party that  offered hope in return for their vote? Mostly those voters  now sit and watch their hopes via free housing, food, medical and TV screens. There is no other kind of life for them.

Oh, come on, Ally, a headache again tonight?! Just take this pill.<br/>This is less a blow for women's rights than Sprout developing a clever marketing strategy for pressuring the FDA into approving a drug that had already been rejected. And no, this does not even the score. Viagra improves bood flow. It does nothing to change men's sexual desire. If you want a do right all night woman, be a do right all day man. Skip the pill, and try a little tenderness.

Do you want your irrational fear factor to plummet?  Stop watching ANY TV news.  I gave it up in its entirety about 8 years ago, just read the NYT and several other websites and magazines for news, and it's made a terrific difference in my overall paranoia.  That media thrives on making your pulse race -- don't let them do it!

So a 4th year college "student" who was shy 32 hours for graduation drops out of school and now he is attacking tenure? I would be more impressed if he went after the police and fire unions but I guess that is too much of a lift. But he is bravely going after bicycles with a $25 tax idea and cutting bike lanes. I guess he IS Presidential timber after all!!

Do conflicts that bring people to war ever simply vanish when the military war is over?<br/><br/>To ask if the Civil War ever ended is kind of an odd question, at least to me. I get the idea but I don't think it's a productive way to ask the question, though I understand it is a catchy headline (it got me to read the article!), so fair enough.<br/><br/>To me, yes, the Civil War ended. Great-great grandaddy returned to North Carolina from Elmira Prison, Great Grandaddy fought WWI in France, Grandaddy got the Navy Cross in WWII, and 5 of his 6 kids live in CA, NY or CT, as do their kids. 5 &amp; 6 generations from my numerous Confederate ancestors, I am literally a born and raised (Liberal) Connecticut Yankee... oddly enough, still a Democrat.<br/><br/>But, racism is alive and well, if that was your question, and it was never unique to the South.

What is wrong with the priorities of our society, corporate culture and big Pharma?  This has nothing to do with equality -- it's about profits!  Between this drug and viagra, I wonder how much more degraded our culture can be.  Although, it can be another useful distraction from real issues in our world that need attention.

A historical reminder of Presidencies and the unemployment rate:<br/><br/>Hoover: Unemployment up<br/>Roosevelt: Down<br/>Truman: Down<br/>Eisenhower: Up<br/>Kennedy: Down<br/>Johnson: Down<br/>Nixon: Up<br/>Ford: Up<br/>Carter: Down<br/>Reagan: Down<br/>Bush: Up<br/>Clinton: Down<br/>Bush: Up<br/>Obama: Down<br/><br/>See a pattern ?<br/><br/>No wonder why Reagan is a hero to the GOP. He is the only President since Coolidge under whom unemployment was lower when he left than when he started. Coolidge !<br/><br/>You can't even find a Democratic President under whom unemployment was higher when he left than when he started.

"Privacy" shifts its meaning depending on its "contrast class"--"private" as opposed to what?<br/><br/>Private vs public enterprise? Much public enterprise (infrastructure) is desirable, even necessary for civilization and civility--presuming law and order, rules and regulations.  Often we are less civilized in private.<br/><br/>Private vs public schools?  The latter are not fee-for service opportunities, so not limited by a family's ability to pay.  They are public goods--everyone benefits from an educated population.<br/><br/>Private vs public body parts?  Nudists make them all public. Many find covering up more aesthetically appealing.  And if sexy we'd prefer not be distracted.<br/><br/>Private vs public activity? Some things we'd rather not have audiences or spectators for.  And some spectacles are only enjoyed by perverts--Peeping Toms.  Publicity can be embarrassing.  NSA wasn't in this category, was it?<br/><br/>Private vs public ownership?  Some corporations are publicly traded--"owners" changing hourly. Others are owned by named individuals.<br/><br/>Rights/duties "in personam" vs "in rem." Some rights are correlated  with duties to specific persons as opposed to the world at large.  Thus much "private enterprise" is very public.  "Private" can mean merely NGO!<br/><br/>Private vs public can also be a matter of psychic closeness--family and friends vs business.<br/><br/>Reputations are public, the reality of our personas may be very different; we'd all like more control over our reputations--frauds and terrorists too.

Something wrong with you, Anita?  Job envy is showing.  Tear down the people who have some security.  Let me ask you:  Is being a professor like being a middle manager or an assembly-line worker?  Of course it is! -- you would say.

Hate? More like frustration with the Southern psyche that has never forgotten  the Civil War &amp; the result, The young children of the South continue to play "War between the North &amp; South games" instead of the classic "Cops &amp; Robbers". Adults in the South perpetrate this "them against us" mentality, "carefully teaching their children to hate &amp; fear, from year to year". Tolerance isn't a Southern concept. As for the Republicans, in name only, aka the Dixiecrats! and in reality, not the party of Lincoln.

Tito:  Seriously? This was the argument trotted out by the secessionists, too. [The British then and after the revolution would  have agreed, by the way, regarding Washington!]<br/><br/>By your logic, however, ANY time a disgruntled political unit within the US wanted to secede, it should have the right to do so.  Over time, we would become a Balkanized mass of city-states, lacking any cohesion, fighting with each other over territory and economic issues, insular, and unable to achieve what we think of as national aspirations or improvements or to have any global influence.<br/><br/>Then, there are the constitutional issues.  Even Buchanan (a great friend and supporter of Southern interests) said in 1860 that "the Union was intended to be perpetual and not to be annulled at the pleasure of any one of the contracting parties" (basing this on, among other things, the preamble to the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation, which described the Union as "perpetual"). His warning was that if secession were possible, the states would become "as many petty, jarring, and hostile republics, each one retiring from the Union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course. By this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks which cost our forefathers many years of toil, privation and blood to establish." All this as part of his effort to get Northern states to enforce the fugitive slave laws (and to preserve the Union)!

Why do we persisit in embarassing ourselves as a democracy by allowing ourselves and our so-called representatives to call for prosecution of Snowden for having broken the law and serving "some jail time"? He IS in jail for having catalyzed the long lost transparency of our democracy. Civil disobedience akin to street marches maybe. We have thousands of elected officials who have committed crimes (are committing crimes) and who walked together with their legal teams into freedom's light unscathed having contributed nothing. Senator Feinstein, please, get off of your superior attitudinal perch and grow up!

Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain recently mused, “Do we want to allow a means of communication between people which we cannot read?” He soon found his answer, proclaiming that “for too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens: As long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone.”<br/>___________<br/>David Cameron actually said that?<br/><br/>Wow! Just wow!

THE TAX CUT ZOMBIE AND THE LONE STAR STATE  So Texas has stumbled?  Well, pride goeth before a fall.  But maybe not so much for those who believe, like Rick Perry, that they are the beneficiaries of divine choice.  I think that Texans like nothing so much as a good ghost story around their campfires.  So if we could only convince them that the Tax Cut Zombie is going to destroy their state, we might get somewhere.  They like magic tricks and mega-church huckstering too.  You catch more flies with honey than with tax cuts.  OOPS!

If the Air Force is really still using 5" floppy discs in our nuclear missile silos, what do we expect?  And since Congress has been starving federal budgets for years ("...small enough to put in a bathtub &amp; drown"), what do we expect?  The lack of ability by our government is a direct consequence of years and years of irresponsible funding by congress, who now blames the agencies they have starved for poor performance! And we join them, conveniently forgetting this planned attack on our government by our own elected &amp; purchased officials over a period of many years.  You don't think this doesn't catch up and create cumulative increasingly significant failures?  If you were good at something, would you want to work for a business that strangles all your abilities? If you were good at something, would you be willing to be forced to use antiquated equipment? No! You would move on, &amp; who is left?  It just gets worse as we slide down hill. We are doing this to ourselves and allowing this ourselves, then blaming the people who are left for what we have done.  We are the "something for nothing" society.  China is just taking advantage of what we have given them. (With apologies to the many dedicated men &amp; women still in government service still trying to make things work).  Good luck, we desperately  need you to keep trying.

How do "Conservatives willing to look at the facts" ever be realized? There is absolutely no profit in it for their overlords?  American politics has crossed the line into a permanent video game for all the big players on the extreme right. At this point the action has the liberals and progressives poised as the evil demons with the goal of liberating Ronald Reagan the top prize, with the ultimate end of restoring Dick Nixon to the "Throne. None of the conservatives have the slightest intention of doing anything other than destroying the whole concept of government of the people, for the people, and by the people.<br/><br/>We have to stop playing their game of trying to answer the conservative message with "facts". If this were enough to win the game, then it would already be done. We have a new royal oligarchy that makes the monarchy of old look like children playing at recess in elementary school. The whole world has been transformed since the end of the 2 World Wars. The advent of nuclear weapons and the inconceivable horrors of humankind has destroyed the power of the people to assume any position of power. With the assassinations in the sixties the die was cast that leads directly to today's imbecilic world. Taxes? They don't care a whit!

Grief: What is good for?<br/><br/>My brother died last year. I just recently (almost 7 or 8 months) later felt the numbness was gone...did not even know I was numb!<br/><br/>All the best to Sheryl. This is the sort of thing no money or life styles makes any difference. We all suffer similar ways.

Just upper middle class and the rich voting Republican? If only it were true! The GOP in the Obama era has become the party of white losers, in the literal and figurative sense, and the 1% that lives off of them. If that sounds harsh, let me explain: literally because blue collar jobs and wages have been shrinking since the union busting of the Reagan era; figuratively because they tend to blame people of a darker shade for their dilemma, if Google maps on the n-word are any indication.

Think?  What's that all about?  It's a foreign concept that doesn't even need a special visa!  <br/><br/>We do not think, we already know: NO TAXES no how.  Who cares what happens as long as we can hang on to every last cent?

Why don't you return to your home country and face justice like a real man?  I think you are completely wrong-headed and dangerous to have revealed what you did and the way you did it.   We live in a very dangerous world and one we in this country have not fully comprehended.  We still have not thought critically enough about security as this is a new technology.  I lived behind the so-called "Iron Curtain" for a couple of years and I understand a little about secrecy and the restrictions of freedom.  And we as a country are still naive, or as my father (who was in WW 1) used to say, do not know enough about the realities of conflict and wars.  And to stay in Russia, ruled by a very dangerous despot, is in itself, an indication of your misunderstanding of the world.  You are no hero!

Can we stop equating the so-called espionage conducted by Google, Apple, et al with that conducted by the NSA?<br/><br/>Here's the difference: The NSA, FBI, and CIA have guns. They can hit you with charges so secret you can't read them. They can impose gag rules so you can't talk about what's happening to you. And they can "disappear" you into prison. <br/><br/>Google? They can try to sell you stuff. Big whoop! And if you don't like them--don't use Chrome, and don't Google.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Guns are scarier than ads. And guns supported by the force of law are WAY scarier than any other kind.

Am I the only one who has no problem with the gov't collecting my portion of metadata?  I'll assume that they're not caring about/anazlyzing/monitoring my benign conversations with my friends and family about sports, movies I've seen, relationships, politics, etc.  If/when they do intrude and begin arresting people for things that they were not searching for in the first place, then I'll join the complain train.  But until that unlikely day comes, I'm fine with them analyzing metadata, including my own contributions, in the name of public and national safety.  Enjoy eavesdropping on my conversations with my mom, NSA!

How hypocritical can you get? Or is it Kafkaesque? You trust the likes of Google, Microsoft, Comcast, Time-Warner, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, et al,  to receive and retain your information, and even to analyze your communications in order to send you solicitations based on your information, but you don't trust "the government" to collect mega-data so as to identify terrorist information. Puhleez!  Not to mention hackings by folks from the middle east, to your new home state, Russia, to China - this is apparently ok with you.  Talk about who is really living in a paranoid film noir cold war world!<br/><br/>Mr. Snowden, you are an apologist for yourself, and who knows what or who you have compromised or harmed. The fact that the American Congress is too dysfunctional to pass any legislation, good or bad, is not an endorsement of your temperamental ego outburst. Wake up and smell the coffee! This is a new world where big data are necessary for national security. You had better remain in Russia where you can more conveniently time your further releases of classified information according to the agenda of your new buddies, Mr. Putin and his cronies.

Oh please you're saying Americans don't cheat? Years back in NYC, the NYT reported American kids cheating. How about the Board of Ed in Georgia? Or the Intro to Congress/Government class at Harvard? How about those cheating scandals? Or how about Joe Biden's bar exam? Or how about American corporate espionage which Snowden revealed. Funny how that point about Americans committing corporate espionage gets omitted so often in media. Obviously Americans are on the side of righteousness and justice. We're heroes after all, that's what movies, pop culture and DC/Marvel Comics tell us! Hiring illegals, violating human rights at Guantanamo, labor practices, police brutality, invading countries, bombing civilians, massacring them with AC-130s (thanks Chelsea Manning). Everything we Americans do is right! Everything the Chinese do is wrong! That is the impression I'm getting from most biased Americans. Let's look at things objectively yeah?! Criminals are everywhere, in all colors and all races and all genders. Criminal behavior is blind to these factors.

Shouldn't be the goal to eliminate violent crimes? The statistical approach to analyze these problems has a significant flaw: it is judging a change versus the usual standard deviation of the number of crimes. Yes - there might be only a small change that might not be statistical significant at this time - but that does not justify the fact that the crime rates are too high in the first place. Referring to a "no change" situation implies in a certain way that everything is "normal". No - it is not! The crime rate for instance in Baltimore has never been acceptable. The first step to improvement is that the involved cities and communities acknowledge that a change is needed - independent of the recent protests and riots.

@ Andrew:  You're comparing this show with Schindler's List and the Diary of Anne Frank?  Are you serious?  Those are dramas depicting historical events.  This is a game show where the contestants are there to win a $40,000 prize! Can you see the difference?

I loved Sam Sifton's  wording today in the email that featured this recipe, it says "Do you need a Birthday Cake today?" and I thought to myself, why yes I do, because it's MY birthday (but I'm not going to make it for myself). It gave me a smile, though!

What does Netanyahu and  Israel have to do with this?  The fight in the Islamist world is their own and has been going on forever. They are killing, kidnapping and raping each other.  They don't care about the Palestinian issue at all. They never even mention it. A red herring!

You mean to tell me that the tale of a carriage trade young scholar being accepted into the ranks of a group of rough and raw thugs might have been exaggerated?  Get out!<br/>Seriously, all the wealth and privilidge that this Princeton grad was born into wasn't enough- not the fine schools, the comfortable cultured parents, the hometown with functioning civic life, the incredible gift of never knowing violence, of never having even once known 15 minutes of terror and real trouble?  No, still more is coveted: the 'realness' of the ghetto, the cache of saying you know that world, to arrogate into your possession the sorrow and tears of the poor.  What a despicable and delusional marker of a culture obsessed with possessing and owning things.

What about the Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal? He started out being a moderate policy wonk who warned his fellow Republicans against becoming "the party of Stupid." Well, guess what? Stupid sells! Our Bobby quickly figured out which way the wind was blowing, aligned himself with the Tea Partiers and evangelicals, and now espouses every weirdo policy that comes down the pike. <br/><br/>The one thing all these candidates have in common is their groveling fealty to the ultra conservative billionaires -- Adelson, Koch, etc. -- who set the pro-business/crush the poor and middle class agenda. They are the actual candidates in 2016 so we should just skip the primaries and put these guys on the Presidential ballot. Save us all a lot of time and money. And Gail could get back to the more serious issues facing the nation: Caitlin Jenner's re-assignment surgery and the name for Kim and Kanye's new baby.

It seems that one of the big problems we humans have is that we ask the question, "Can we do it?" instead of "Should we do it?".  Or we ask in the wrong order and the cans are running away with the technology and the shoulds get let behind in the dust because everybody is gaga over the new exciting technology.<br/><br/>For example, one of the first comments I read, pjs said that people will be trying to get into an accident with a self-driving car so they can sue for damages.  I hadn't even thought of that!  There is so much conversation to be had about it - including what Google will do with our information.  <br/><br/>I personally like the idea of a car that can drive itself.  But there is so much to consider and I wonder if us 'every day' people will be able to shape the conversation at all or whether the technology geeks will just forge ahead.<br/><br/>Here's one prediction:  people will spend more time in the back seat than the front!

Violent crime is up across the city, and the Editorial board says "get a grip"?  What about the rise in sexual assaults?<br/><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/06/02/sex-crimes-rising-at-an-alarming-rate/" title="http://nypost.com/2015/06/02/sex-crimes-rising-at-an-alarming-rate/" target="_blank">http://nypost.com/2015/06/02/sex-crimes-rising-at-an-alarming-rate/</a><br/><br/>And, despite the claims of this editorial, there is evidence that the "cops are demoralized and unwilling to do their jobs aggressively":<br/>"Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said officers in the Western District [of Baltimore] are struggling to do basic police work without backup, as they are routinely surrounded by 30 to 50 residents, some of whom hold cellphones or video cameras "an inch" from officers' faces."<br/><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-shootings-20150521-story.html" title="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-shootings-20150521-story.html" target="_blank">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-shootings-...</a><br/><br/>The fact that overall crime is a direct result of fewer drug arrests, so that statistic is misleading.  In fact, the decrease in those arrests is likely contributing to the increase in violent crime!<br/><br/>I work in a public hospital ER, and I have seen the increased number of stabbings, shootings, and deaths since de Blasio became Mayor.  This increase is a major problem, and the only thing that has changed in the last two years is the Mayor, end of stop and frisk, and the media creating a hostile environment against police.  No other measure (e.g. economic, social, etc) can explain this rise.<br/>It is horrible to see the Editorial Board ignore and cover up the real cause for this increase.  Time to support the police and enforce the policies that keep people alive and safe!

What happens if the system shuts down or they upgrade the software &amp; you have no idea how to use the update?  I've literally had upgrades to my iPad, laptop, desktop, phone &amp; the slightest change takes a day to figure how to rework when the old one was working perfectly fine for me.<br/>What if we get hacked for the pleasure of some jerk who is simultaneously watching the accidents pan out on CNN. I'm sure there are sadistic weirdos working at google too.<br/>Not only does it promote lack of attention, it makes the "driver" deserve the scorn of the backseat driver.<br/>I have a much better idea. Learn the rules of the road. Don't slam on your brakes to be a nice guy when you're on the main road with the right of way to let a car out of a side street. It causes accidents. Yield doesn't mean slam on your brakes, it means proceed with caution. Getting on a freeway isn't hard. All you need to do is merge at a slower level.<br/>How about big, fat signs saying "nobody actually cares what you're texting" "you most likely will still have your under paid job if you wait until the next red light to read that email" "pay attention"!<br/>And what does that do for man-Ual ( and I mean actual people) training? Drivers Ed actually teaches more safety tips than a computer program. Is google going to virtually change your tire? Is it going to tell you that you need to get out of the line of traffic when you breakdown? How are supposed to steer out of the line of traffic when you have no steering wheel? Bunk!

On what legal basis would you convict and put her in prison? The psychic business appears to be legal, or haven't you seen the shopfronts with their neon signs?  It's what they do!  I think it's awful, but we allow it. Why, I don't know.

Everyone in the world has one or two parents -- except for those who don't and that's not that many  -- so WHAT IS GOING ON?  and who should be arrested.  There is no reason why children should grow up thinking crime is OK (and this includes in my mind all of the white collar criminals!!) <br/><br/>Why not do something like have community patrols???  (yes there was a mess in Florida -- in what was prob. NOT a high crime district.) And BTW who is really getting all of the $$ from the drug trade and where are their MacMansions.  I am so tired of the Mafia, etc.  (FIFA -- etc. corrupt politicians.) A few gang murders pale in comparison.  (More police -- and there are criminals there as well -- are not the answer.)

and religious charlatans don't? What's all that tithe business? You're not sending 10% to GOD! these preachers of every strip are walking around with millions and poor people are scraping together their pennies so that some distant 'entrepreneur' can say a prayer for them. <br/><br/>The thing I hate the most is the hypocrisy. If you believe in something you cannot see then you need to open your mind to every possibility. If you believe in God and all that mythology, then God made psychics just like he or she made you.

Your mother is 101 right? You're correct about what it takes to live a longer, happier life although I'm just not sure about relationships and how that effects longevity. I'm once divorced and my partner died last year of ovarian cancer so I'm taking my time trying to decide about another relationship. I'm still grieving although I'm making a good effort to be as happy as I can be at the moment. Relationships are complicated arrangements, but that's life anyway. Hey, I assume you're wearing a helmet when you ride!

The top WH cyber official and a top Obama security official declined to speak on the record, or to be interviewed? !<br/>Well, just when can we expect some response, some accountability and some housecleaning?<br/><br/>Sure we need the congress to ‘come out of the Dark Ages and take steps to protect us.<br/><br/>But to take coordinated, well financed effort to stop cyber attacks on govt requires big big Govt. Just what the gop rw has been undermining for decades. It just may be worth it to them to tolerate atrocious computer hacking, as long as we keep our ‘freedom and liberty’ with small govt.  That’s the excuse they’ll use, just wait for it.<br/><br/>The more they can point to the lapses in govt, that their own underfunding causes, the more they can discredit govt itself. These are the steps to their true aim-- Govt by corporations—unregulated and unaccountable.

Whatever happened to the days when Navy SEALs shunned publicity and refused to have their pictures taken? Nowadays, they are the glamor girls of the Special Operations community. Half of these guys join with the idea that once they cash out to cash in they'll get a book deal or star in a movie. And the amount of whining that comes out of the SEAL community is disgraceful. Lone Survivor? What in the world did Luttrell and his buddies think they were signing up for in the first place?  A chance to be cool? And then there was the controversy about who actually killed bin Laden. "I killed bin Laden. No, you didn't kill bin Laden, I killed bin Laden!" Remember the sap article that Robert O'Neill had ghostwritten for him that appeared in Esquire? You want see real courage firsthand? Walk into into children's' cancer ward and look at the parents and kids. These people play it as it lays every day.

I remember seeing him first in There Will Be Blood and thinking who is this guy?  He was fantastically awful as an evangelical  (meaning he played the role very well). Creepy.  He was so young .  Since then, I've seen him in very different roles,  always good, which demos his talent.  Glad to see him as leading  man  -  very talented!!!

So the little dears all wear halos and anything untoward is a tragic mistake?<br/><br/>Forgive me for doubting it!<br/><br/>Sad that it includes the 'Killing of  Osama bin Laden', who died in 2001 and the funeral was widely reported throughout the ME.  Sort of destroys the credibility of those who wrote this, somewhat.<br/><br/>But hey,  if you are writing a script for a movie, a little trashing of the truth is warranted, isn't it?<br/><br/>Heros? Murders more likely.  but this as ever is the way of the US.

Are you going to Belmont today and wearing a hat for American Pharoah?  Of course, was my reply to a friend.  'The track is dry which is all to the good and early this morning he was eating his oats, wondering why everyone was fussing, polishing his hoofs, grooming and brushing his mane'.<br/><br/>At 5:30 a.m. Saturday in New York, the downpour was the cause of a frown for this native of the City; a cause to fret for the Winner of the Triple Crown.<br/>A smile later as the skies cleared, and this lover of all horses then took a quiet nap late afternoon to wake up and see the results.<br/><br/>A wonder, a joy, a feeling of hope in times of adversity, reminiscent of when Sea Biscuit in 1939 drew the crowds to a roar and the Nation to pause in the era of the American Depression.<br/><br/>'Write your story for us, American Pharaoh, and thanking you for this Championship Season, a moment of glory well-needed'.  Hats off to his owner who in his own words treated him as a son.  To his trainer who believed in him, and to one of our finest American jockeys.<br/><br/>A time to celebrate and a time to invite us to go forth, while American Pharaoh has taken the crown on a sunny day at Belmont, bringing us all together after a wicked dry spell of thirty-seven years.  Well done!

What are you talking about? Women's soccer. basketball, tennis and softball are produced exactly like the men's games on every network I get.<br/><br/>Just watched Canada vs China on the Fox streaming site.<br/><br/>Identical to Brazil last year, including the "look away/crossed arms" player intros!

When will we ever have to deploy 500,000 ground troops again?<br/>The downsizing of our military wasn’t just Obama’s grand plan- but most high ranking generals agree the U.S. needs a smaller and more agile fighting force. To make up for the traditional “strength in numbers” mentality we need more highly skilled Special Force Operatives.  ST6 and Delta should be the standard blueprint for our modern military.<br/>The reality is military service is a social safety net for many American’s who come from educationally and economically deprived households. Many barely graduate high school- and their justification for serving is out of necessity not patriotism.<br/>If we are going to continue to meddle in foreign affairs and interject ourselves in every global conflict that erupts, then we should bite the bullet and reinstate the draft or begin a compulsory 3 year service for every 18 YO citizen- No exemptions! Even the mentally and physically challenged can contribute- I can think plenty of jobs they can do!<br/>If all of our sons and daughters had skin in the game, maybe Senators McCain and Graham won’t be so quick to deal in death and judgment all the time!

The '55-58 Chevys were far superior and Edsel was the worst of all the Ford products.<br/><br/>Ford outsold Chevy because it was cheaper.

Who is anyone to say what makes a woman? Even us cisgendered women who've lived as women our whole lives can't say there's one definition of "womanhood." Why can't Caitlyn Jenner's definition be just as valid as mine? We have girly girls, tomboys, androgynous women... are we really going to say that womanhood is defined by our organs and genitals? What about women who can't have children? What about cisgendered women who have conditions where they don't get their periods ever? Or intersex women who have XY chromosomes and no uterus, but look and feel like women, many even have breasts and vaginas, such as those with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Disorder? <br/><br/>I get the point about how she hasn't had to deal with the same struggles her whole life, but she will now. Case in point, the entire media obsessing over how she looks, because as Jon Stewart said, that's all anyone cares about when you're a woman. So we're mad that she's a Johnny come lately to the "woman party"? So? If someone looses all of their money and savings from some tragedy and is suddenly dirt poor, do we disregard their struggle simply because they're new to being poor? Do we tell them, "Hey, you've only been poor for 1 year, so you don't have a right to talk about what it's like to struggle, since you were rich for so long"? No! Their perspective may not be exactly the same, but their situation and stuggle shouldn't be discounted because what matters is what's happening to them right now.

Surely the big-government/small-government debate is out of date?  Real government is not where the nominal authority lies, but who has the real power!<br/><br/>We either have big government which is democratically accountable and, in a well functioning state, where decisions are devolved to local communities wherever possible, OR we have the big government of the international corporate oligopoly, which is barely accountable for its actions, nor subject to democratic oversight, and hence can ride roughshod over the broad mass of humanity.

If you want it neat, tidy, sterile, and legal? Then don't go to war. If you want the really ugly stuff done that has to be done in war (no ROE, no taking prisoners, no taking prisoners back to the US for trial) then do what DOD has done for the last 13 years. They call 1-800-call-seals!! If you want something different, enlist in the Navy &amp; go for BUDS. Until then, sit down, shut up &amp; color, because these incredibly dedicated men are doing the really dirty work for you.<br/>You're welcome!

Among Douthat's suggestions to put down Hillary is for adversaries to attack  "the way her family fattened itself on global tribute during her recent public service" Right, Ross, the kind of ethics lapse best exemplified by the person whom you probably consider an exemplary president, the late, unlamented Ronald Reagan, who accepted, (required?) 2 million dollars for a speech in Japan.<br/>Ah, the joys of convenient forgetfulness!

NYT? do me a favor, please. if you are going to have an opp piece that is anti trans, can you at least have someone who is knowledgeable and articulate on the subject? most of the ideas in this article could not be more stale having first been put forward by the TERFs in the late 70's and 80's that the author seems to think are new. what's worse her points are incoherent. in one sentence she is an essentualist (you're not a woman if you haven't taken birth control (and have ovaries)!!!) but in the very next claims womanhood is experiential (women are the sum of their experiences!). she clearly knows little to nothing about the actual subject to boot. i love how she talks about his privilege as if being trans was a ticket to the good life. never mind that most transpeople can get fired or kicked out of their house simply for being trans. never mind that for the 70 cents on the dollar women make compared to men, transwomen earn even less.....if they can find a job. <br/><br/>there is a reason most of her points have been dismissed in the 30+ years since transphobic feminists put them out: if they do make any sense at all, when you follow them to their logical conclusion, or compare them to reality, they don't stand up. <br/><br/> i've been reading pieces both pro and con, and i've been astounded that all of the anti pieces are so slapdash they practically feel like TERF madlibs. i expected more of the NYT, but clearly i expected too much.

A Master's degree  to be a writer? I'm pretty sure you can do that without ANY degree (lookatme! I'm writing!). Taking on college debt requires personal responsibility and a NEED for a college degree (for a profession or for intense personal fulfillment). Which is why this year we decided our daughter, who graduated last week and whose passion is musical theatre, would not be attending college. The debt we would all have to take on didn't make sense. But we will support her to pursue her dream. <a href="http://thebrokeandbeautifullife.com/should-you-go-to-college-for-acting/" title="http://thebrokeandbeautifullife.com/should-you-go-to-college-for-acting/" target="_blank">http://thebrokeandbeautifullife.com/should-you-go-to-college-for-acting/</a>

Protesting a 'party wall' with a gym next door? Well, good luck with that. Just be glad you're not in some 'image' co-op where you might have to deal with picky neighbours who'd want to have YOU evicted as an 'undesirable tenant' merely for not having joined that gym!

@John Smith:  And how, exactly, did that landlord become the landlord?  Did the landlord BUY the building, in which case a business decision was made and perhaps the landlord made a bad decision.  Did the landlord INHERIT the building, in which case the landlord is free to sell it if it doesn't make money. Did the landlord BUILD the building, in which case you are talking about a commercial developer.  Did someone hold a gun to the landlord's head and force the landlord to own a building?  I am unaware of any landlords who are in those circumstances.<br/><br/>Your assertion that a regulated rent "forces the landlord to gouge the market rate tenants" to make up the "loss he suffers with your apartment" is 100% laughable.<br/><br/>Ah, yes, all those poor, suffering landlords in NYC - they are a permanent underclass!  They just can't avoid owning buildings somehow, and they're all losing their shirts &amp; living on canned cat food because they're just soooo very poor; surely this has been the subject of many exposes and documentaries, no?  <br/><br/>Your comment indicates that you know very little about running a building in NYC, or else that you are a landlord yourself - or both!

Why do you need a big picture of a person injecting? Will readers ignore it if no pics?  Why do both show dark skinned people?!? Drug use among whites is huge. <br/><br/>Vermont has the highest rate of illicit drug in US. I read they’re enhancing treatment services with law enforcement.....“addressing it on all fronts.”<br/><br/>But for millions of minorities over decades there was only one front addressed on drug ----mass incarceration, extreme sentencing, ruined lives and families. <br/><br/>See NYT on Staten Island NY’s big heroin problem. Is mass incarceration happening there? <br/><br/>See “Tough Texas gets results by going softer on crime”, Washington Post. <br/><br/>“... instead of building new prisons..they built a treatment system. To counter the huge number of former inmates who returned to jail after violating parole, they created hundreds of new beds in drug treatment programs with names like the In-Prison Therapeutic Treatment and Substance Abuse Felony Punishment Facilities.”<br/><br/>Pre-trial diversion programs for those suffering from mental illnesses, overseen by officers who specialize in mental health and drug treatment helped more people avoid jail.”<br/>There was a “deliberate decision,” he said, to have a range  of programs to reduce return trips to prison.”<br/><br/>"The state’s crime rate has fallen dramatically. Recidivism is down, 28 % to 22.6. ...multiple reforms  created a stable system –and saved the state $3 BILLION...they funded programs rather than prisons. “<br/>Nothing like a positive model.

I think the question is how you judge "valuable"?  If you judge valuable by creating a watch that you can talk to and vibrates when someone thinks of you, you may indeed be challenged in understanding this author. Try imaging the work of educating your society's children, for example, or  creating a mural on an ugly building, or writing a poem as valuable, then you may better empathize with the author.  Reading a fine book or attending a play may also help. Good luck!

Wow give away higher education for free?<br/>How about our own president saying after he was elected that he was still paying off his college loans many years after graduation.<br/>I still have a problem understanding how people get loans to increase their earning potential and get high paying jobs and then default on the repayment of the money that enabled them to do so because it is hard to do so. And who can take away an education?<br/>I know many a person who did just that and proudly tell of how they beat the government out of money by defaulting on the loan to do so. But when I ask the question of them "WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT" they look at me and say "Big Business, Corporations, and Rich People". And yes they are partly correct.<br/>But those mom and dads who both work to educate, cloth and feed those children would disagree with you about taxes they pay to educate you the person who is defaulting on your loans because you disagree with being charged for getting a higher education that will give you a advantage in getting a job or career with a greater salary than most receive. And by not repaying the loan you are denying their children of an education.<br/>You are the person who promised to repay those mom and dads the dollars they borrowed to get that American dream of a better job. But who will suffer? The borrower, No. The Corporation NO. We already know the Corporations the rich, big business, do not pay their fair share of tax so who? Those Mom and Dads! THINK!!

Who keeps selling these "Clintons are Evil Incarnate" stories?  The Right, and the media that loves to rake dirt...<br/><br/>The members of the Right Wing Congress who have thrown mud her way for years, knowing she likely can demolish any candidate that put up...<br/><br/>The Left Wing Pundits of TV and the NY Times, who have bought into all f the negativity, and who like so many on the Left, obsessively, convulvisely blame and demonize their Leadership with a passion only *slightly* exceeded by the Far Right...<br/><br/>Such Pundits regularly blame their leaders, while The GOTP holds Party Unity, and also blames Democratic Leaders.  The result is EVERYONE blames Democrats.  Ultimately, Democrats wonder why they have so many problems stopping the GOTP Clown Car....<br/><br/>Clinton's sins are few and mild compared to almost any on the Right: it's the GOTP howling, and the Left's obsession with having *perfect* candidates that make it so.  In politics, abilty to raise money, attract money, almost BE MONEY is a critical asset.  The Right sees it as a Strength, the Left as a Dark and Evil Failing.  I am so sick of hearing about the Clinton's and their Foundation, and Money!  They will need it to mount a campaign.  Good for them!<br/><br/>The Right now has custom candidates with custom PACs, and Billionaires who literally front and manage entire ranks of candidates.  This is their new norm: nobody on the Right complains much, especially if it wins them elections.<br/><br/>Why the Double Standard?  The Left needs to Wake Up!

Why would the author mention a one sided documentary? Scahill took only the facts that backed his opinion and then filled it with a lot of conjuncture and ideology. The best part is the title "Dirty Wars" as if there ever has been a "clean war!" How do you feel about the actions of the allied soldiers who killed almost 20,000 French citizens in the two months after D Day? Nobody is calling that a dirty war, it's just the reality of war!

There was an in-depth report by Jason Cherkis on Huffington Post (?!) about Medication Assisted Treatment for opiates (MAT) that has been effective for many people but has been opposed &amp; suppressed by 12-Step-devoted practitioners who insist that 12-Step abstinence-only is sole solution&amp; who claim that MAT patients aren't truly "sober." It also mentions NYT's Sontag article on Bupe &amp; its negative perspective (I'd add it's hard to trust a reporter who defers to Robert DuPont as a responsible authority).<br/><br/><a href="http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/dying-to-be-free-heroin-treatment" title="http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/dying-to-be-free-heroin-treatment" target="_blank">http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/dying-to-be-free-heroin-treatment</a><br/><br/>The comments posted there are extremely revealing. <br/><br/>The rehab industry uses a duplicitous 'bait &amp; switch' tactic of boldly declaring that addiction is a disease in need of medical treatment, then their actual "treatment" is 12-Step faith healing.Eg. among these comments: read Steve Castleman's post below, then follow the link &amp; it turns out he presents 12-Step as the solution, complete w/ apologetics about its religious basis (which of course 12-Steppers conceal or deny to newcomers &amp; general public).<br/><br/>Though not addicted to opiates, I personally witnessed how 12-Step-devoted rehabs suppress MAT &amp; non-12-Step options. One was even listed as a methadone provider, yet they refused to provide it. Since the ACA requires that rehabs who receive govt $'s offer MAT, now they are making MAT contingent upon 12-Step involvement, which is illegal since it's religious (see Hazle v Crofoot, Inouye v Kemna, many others).

After making a series of poor life decisions concerning your college choice (too expensive, beyond your family's means), educational major (English lit?), and unwilling to get a job that would support you and your obligation to repay your college loans, you've thrown in the towel and decided that all non-wealthy taxpayers should bail you out.  You fit the description of the proverbial dead beat who thinks the world owes you a living.  I went to law school and graduated in a year that coincided with the largest economic recession since the "Great Depression."  Despite my massive educational debt, lack of a job practicing law, and lack of any full-time permanent job, I am still today repaying my law school loans made possible by my determination to avoid bankruptcy and financial failure by taking any work available at the time.  I worked three temp jobs averaging a 12-14 hour work day for two years until the economy improved enough to allow me to find a modest full time job again with benefits.  I have never been able to realize my dream of practicing law to assist individuals needing a legal advocate, yet I have managed to stay gainfully employed in something I personally find mearningless but that pays my bills including the large law school loan.  There is no excuse for abandoning your obligation to the US taxpayers to repay your educational debt unless you had the misfortune of becoming physically unable to working.  Laziness isn't an excuse!

Does one really need 4+ years of college and then graduate school to become a - writer?  Like, I learned to write by 8th grade or so.  Even had decent grammar by then (BTW Mr. Siegel needs to understand when and when not to use "whose").<br/><br/>The fact is that undergraduate and graduate enrollment makes little sense if the programs do not involve necessarily cumulative  learning, as in the natural sciences, history, economics etc.  I always thought it farcical that the largest major in my alma mater was (&amp; probably still is) - ready? - English!<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do agree with him that it's outrageous how the 1% class can choose crime with total impunity.  Our judicial system is totally corrupt, no question about it, exactly as he describes.  Got the money, do what you like, just pay the expensive lawyers and lobbyists.

Where art thou Google? Google failed me this time. I've lost my faith. Turns out I'm not a doctor after all.<br/><br/>In my perfect "think like a doctor" design the winner would need to express not only the first correct diagnosis but also make the best articulated and most clinically compelling argument that justifies it. Because now? Right now it is every reader a genius, every contestant not just a doctor but a think like a doctor House MD. Zebra? What zebra? He or she is able to instantly spot a zebra even while blindfolded and from a mile away, a diagnostic mystery being anything but! The only real puzzle is whether there actually exists a case study hard enough to stump even the cleverest clinicians among us for longer than a few sorry minutes!<br/><br/>Love the articles please keep them coming, um, indefinitely please. Thanks!

Well, I am emphatically no longer a fan of Stannis the Mannis, although I probably shouldn't have been in the first place, right? This repulsive moment was a stark reminder that--oh yeah!--this guy has been burning all sorts of innocent people arrive for no reason other than to buy minor, fleeting favors from a god of smoke and mirrors. This will be the sacrifice that burns him, though, as it will surely bring about some real world consequences that have no need of interpretation. (Come on, Selyse; kill Agamemnon.)<br/><br/>With all this high drama and bad CGI dragon-riding spectacle, though, it seems like everyone has missed out on two very important details from the fighting pit sequence. 1) The Sons of the Harpy are, contrary to expectation, both Masters AND freed slaves. (They even ice the guy Dany and Daario assumed was their secret leader.) 2) JORAH GAVE DANY GREYSCALE. And Dany then passed it to Missandei. Just once touch is all it takes, and we got close-up for every brief hand-on-hand moment. Internet speculation about Mormont becoming Meereen's Patient Zero seems to have been validated.

The GOP base is rooted in an evangelical theology that sees the end of the world as immanent and real, so we should expect less?  Of course this same theology posits stewardship over an anthropocentric world?  Just how this jibes with their eschatology points as much to irony as it does paradox.  If we leave aside the impenetrable ignorance of such theology, the underlying interests of corporate masters make it clear that profit is always superior to people, property better than labor because freedom! because the market is knows the right!  The alignment that pairs invincible stupidity with exploitative corporate interests creates no possibility of change: the EPA will simply be drowned in a Norquist bathtub while our water, air, and environment becomes a cesspool waiting for the End Times.  Good luck, Mr President, you really don't stand a chance.

Aside from oil and gas what exactly are you writing about?! If you really want to see Russia's power you should come to southern Brooklyn, the Russians and a good number of their fellow comrades are not only helping to spur a continuing boom, but some of them have actually been seen breaking out in smiles, and using our advanced plumbing facilities! Yes, the real workingman's paradise, by comparison! Oh. wait the LSU Tiger Long Sleeve I bought a few years back is believe it or not, Made in Russia! Yep, that Russian economic bear?!!!

"Why does the NYTimes allow comments on articles involving Russia?" <br/><br/>The comments are useful, they are a direct real-time signal of the level of hybrid warfare conducted against the Ukrainian people and the World at large. <br/><br/>Now imagine that you'd listen to nothing else --- and you'd have an insight into the "weaponized propaganda" that aims to control the Russia and its armed forces.  <br/><br/>Today, Anna Nemtsova gives a update in "Want to Get Really Mad About Ukraine? Watch Russian TV" in the Daily Beast.  Her terrifying piece puts the prevalent America-caused-Ukraine-and-much-worse-too by American commentators into perspective: we can shrug the what-aboutism off, not so for Russians who are fed nothing but distortions and lies.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that many NYT readers did not catch on to this before; but then my own attempts at counter-commenting were in the beginning more often censored by the NYT than not!

Why all the fainting alternately on sofas, as a genuinely good writer once put it?<br/><br/>GoT is just heavy-handed marketing of the great themes from world literature which a hearty helping of its TV audience is unlikely to have read, or remember now.<br/><br/>As you have the grace to note, Agamemnon did it first.  I'll add that Medea flew away on a dragon (after chopping up her brother and tossing the bits into the sea to slow down her wrathfully pursuing father); White Walkers are just another zombie horde; the Wildling's giant is, as far as I can see, from the Balrog family...<br/><br/>This stuff is fun if it's done well, and anyone coming after Tolkien is laboring under a serious handicap.  The best I can say for Martin and this TV adaptation is enjoy those millions!

All of McConnell's et al ranting &amp; raving about regulations &amp; job losses is disengenious, what jobs, whose jobs will be lost? The CEO, the so-called job creator? Just more double talk.  I guess what they mean is how can the creators create jobs when the evil incarnate government is "regulating" them away.  The lies are endless, poor things they have to drive on roads regulated so much they have to stay on one side! The horror!  Just shows all the their talk of self regulating market forces is a sham. Maybe that legislator from WY should go visit his constituents  whose water is literally burning as it comes out of the tap, but God forbid fracking should be regulated, even talk of that is considered treasonous in his state.

Haven't you heard? Unions are bad.<br/><br/>CEOs of corporations with salaries in the tens of millions can't afford to pay workers a decent living wage. That would kill jobs!<br/><br/>It's the workers' fault for wanting to make a decent living wage that the job creators can't create all those oh so wonderful jobs!<br/><br/>It's only right that people make as little as humanly possible. That way the CEOs don't have to dip into their own exorbitant and outrageous salaries in order to pay a little more the people who do all the actual real work.<br/><br/>If folks would just learn to live on a dollar a day, then CEOs could afford to give a job to every freedumb lovin' Real Uhmurican.<br/><br/>You know greedy workers though, always wanting a decent living wage.<br/><br/>How dare they...

Is a corporation's objective to make a profit or, is it to maximize profits? And if is it the later, does the society where its market exists serve as any factor in the corporation's long-term objectives?<br/><br/>This conversation - to be kind - regarding Disney's outsourcing and extorting their soon to be former employees, reminds one of the very numerous debates in my college courses back in the 80's. Ultra conservative economist Milton Fried often wrote and addressed the issue of "the sole objective of a business was to make a profit." He also stated, just as numerously, that society's ills such as unemployment and inflation was the role of the government to embark on, not for any business! So in the case here where government and business work together, hand-in-glove, to contribute to the detriment of it's own markets, exactly where are we going?

Come now, who is writing this? A man or a woman? <br/><br/>Women might well be likely to "crouch", or squat, over toilets to urinate, but the reason for that is not simply, or perhaps not even primarily, a "fear" of toilet seats. <br/><br/>It's because many, if not all, women and girls have had the uncomfortable, and yucky, experience of sitting down on a seat only to discover that the seat is wet. Whether wet from the spray of powerful flushing, or from the urine of the previous occupant, who knows or cares--a wet seat is gross. <br/><br/>Since women must sit down, or at least squat or crouch, to urinate properly, and since we are all advised to down at least 64 ounces of water a day to remain "hydrated"--and since older women often feel a need to pee more often, and younger women menstruate--women run in and out of bathrooms a good deal, all day long. <br/><br/>Wiping down seats with disinfecting wipes, as one comment suggests below, is time-consuming, expensive, and also yucky. Who wants to clean public bathrooms?<br/><br/>Why sit if it's not necessary? Besides the bathroom squat nicely tones the thighs!

To whom does Paris belong? Does it belong to the Gauls or the Normans or the Romans or just that amalgam called the French?<br/><br/>To whom does Istanbul belong? To the Turks or the Romans or the Greeks? It was conquered by a lot of conquerors, so who should get it? Based on the criteria used by SCOTUS and this executive branch, certainly _not_ the Turks!<br/><br/>Jerusalem belongs to the people who put it there: the Jews. <br/><br/>It was established over 5000 years ago. It was the capital under King David, about a thousand years BCE. Some may say David was mythological, but the Temple was not. The two Temples were there. Jesus lived there under Roman occupation, but did that make Jesus and the city Roman? The Muslims built their holy sites _on top_ of the Jewish holy sites. Does that negate Judaism's most sacred space?<br/><br/>Our primary text, the TaNaKh, addresses the question of Jerusalem over and over and over. Jews may have been exiled, but they never left. They returned en mass again and again and again. To their own city. Their own holy places. Their own cemeteries. Yes, cemeteries....one of the best ways to see who came when. <br/><br/>"If I forget the, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I forget you; if I do not set Jerusalem above my chiefest joy." Psalm 137;  probably written about 600 years _before_ the common era. <br/><br/>Jerusalem IS Israel's capital. People born in Jerusalem are Israelis. <br/><br/>It's just that simple. <br/><br/><a href="http://wifelyperson.blogspot.com/" title="http://wifelyperson.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://wifelyperson.blogspot.com/</a>

What about tax relief at the bottom by offsetting/increasing corporate income tax revenues at the state and federal level that should be paid by the top multinational corporations? Solutions for income inequality are incomplete without a remedy for the massive income tax avoidance by multinational corporations which causes state and federal budget cuts, decreases revenue sharing with cities and towns, and increases state sales taxes that hit those at the bottom the hardest.  The EU is looking at and Economist Joseph Stiglitz is supporting taxing a multinational corporation as if a single taxable entity via unitary worldwide combined reporting and formulary apportionment. This method has been approved at the state level by the US Supreme Court three times! The UK hates this method because it will be the end of its many tax havens, the most under the control of a single country. Beggar thy neighbor - nobody does it better than Britain.

I want to know why doesn't the Euro Zone try to collect the taxes owed by wealthy Greeks themselves? The Greek gov't is broke. Who is it going to use to collect those back taxes? If the rest of the Europeans are so smart, why don't they do it? Why don't they freeze the assets of these people?<br/><br/>I think the rest of us are tired of the malaise all of this is creating.<br/><br/>Time to rip the Band-Aid off already!

Hmmm, an $80,000 boat?  The greed!!!!  Wait, isn't that about a rounding error to the Clintons? <br/><br/>"Despite an income of $90,000 in 2001...." Really????  Hillary and Bill bravely announced they left the White House bankrupt.<br/><br/>Oh well, again, NYT, please, just endorse Hillary.  You will do that no matter what, so what's the point in "covering" any other candidates?

Was it the Washington Post that first broke this story? (I know I read it somewhere within the past few weeks.)<br/><br/>What no one seems to realize is that Rubio's "run" for the nomination is really his Senate exit strategy.<br/><br/>On the one and extremely unlikely hand that he wins the Presidency: Jackpot! Set for life.<br/><br/>The other extremely UNlikely outcome is that he loses either the nomination or the general election. Then, the "run" will have served its principal purpose as a resume building/experience enhancing process financed by others. It will give him just what he needs to maximize his negotiating power to secure the big-paying job he craves. In 2016, look for Rubio to become an on-air personality (his speaking skills are his greatest asset) or lobbyist.<br/><br/>Either outcome will help him to acquire the resources required to finance  his personal spending agenda (does he have a Rolex, yet?). For the good of his family, it would be even better if can limit his nouveau-riche cravings so that those enhanced resources actually exceed that drain, providing the financial security that has eluded him to date.

Really?  Seriously?<br/><br/>At a time when the median household, not individual but household, income is around $50,000, you expect everyone to view an "extravagant purchase: $80,000 for a luxury speedboat" as a low level splurge?!?<br/><br/>"... using a state Republican Party credit card years ago to pay for a paving project at his home and for travel to a family reunion and..."<br/>It wasn't his personal money or credit.  How is that not stealing?  Doesn't say that he paid it back.  <br/><br/>"...he learned how to manage money through trial and error..."  That's how almost all of us learn but we manage to do it without using party funds improperly, splurging on unnecessary items, and relying on friends.  <br/><br/>"confessed a “lack of bookkeeping skills”"  But we should put him in charge of the national budget?<br/><br/>"amazingly like many other people of his generation and background" -<br/>Those "many other people" shouldn't be president either.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem of all:  "his financial history creates particular complications. It has made him unusually reliant on a campaign donor, Norman Braman, a billionaire who subsidized Mr. Rubio’s job as a college instructor, hired him as lawyer and continues to employ his wife"

The NYT trying to help Marco Rubio?!<br/>Why else would it run a story about<br/>him to which most all of us can relate?<br/>That sound is California falling in what<br/>will be a landslide victory...

And how many adults accept and don't even like realize the  common misuse of common words?  I literally can't.<br/>Like, um, using words like "unbelievable", "amazing", "phenomenal", "awesome"and the like, like, to mean more than average.  Or ignoring the plural nature of the words "media" (singular is medium) and "data" (singular is datum).  I can't. Literally.  Totally gross, dude!

58228
That artilcle you linked is satire, right?  It's "solutions" have been tried berfore over history ....and found wanting.  "Nationalize the industries!!..."??  Why, because the Greek governemnt has proven itself to be SO efficient and organized?  Hilarious.<br/><br/>Capitalism is a terrible way to organize an economy, except for all the others.

Is this article for real? Even as a hit piece it's really weak..<br/><br/>Let's look at the accusations:<br/><br/>A) Rubio declared a net worth of 0 at an age of 29, only a few years out of law school and burdened by student loans.. My guess is that this is probably the case for vast majority of those with law degrees that weren't paid for by their parents <br/><br/>B) he buys $550k home for his large family when as per NYTimes he is earning $300k a year.. Well, this actually looks pretty frugal since most of those who bought into half a million dollar homes during the bubble years made a lot less.. And he clearly could afford to buy an even more expensive home in the context of his income<br/><br/>C) no money down for his first home? And why not? Pretty much anyone who was buying homes and offered to put no money down thanks to one of the government programs to encourage home ownership would do that.. <br/><br/>D) leasing a $50k car while making $200k ? I personally know plenty of people who lease cars of this value and making a lot less <br/><br/>E) buying $80k boat to treat himself after a $800k book deal?! Umm.. Yes! And why not?! He is spending 10%  of his books earnings to buy something he only dreamed off for years <br/><br/>F) using campaign credit cards.. Well, the article qualifies the fact that he reimbursed the campaign for all of personal expenses..  Perhaps he should have used his personal card but if the campaign was reimbursed in timely manner then this is a non-issue..

SO WHAT if round-up is carcinogenic?! Almost all pesticides are! That doesn't mean they're bad to use on plants!<br/>But the main point is that THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GE FOOD, other than the fact that GMOs use less pesticides than other plants.

"Deal with" him?  He's playing with a toy!  I remember well my brothers who had cap guns, the kind you fed those red papers with actual gunpowder into and pulled the trigger which made a loud CRACK sound.  They were silver and had white plastic handles and looked far more like actual guns than plastic toys.  How did he get the "gun"?  Probably bought it at Toys R Us.

Novak lost your support b/c he broke his racquet?? Please, name one top player who has NOT broken his/her racquet in frustration every once in a while. This sport is unbelievably stressful and the player is all alone out there. Give them a break! Today's tennis players are models of civility and sportsmanship compared to older ones, including both Novak and Stan.<br/>As an FYI, here's Stan breaking his racquet: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMNdHfdc-PA" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMNdHfdc-PA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMNdHfdc-PA</a><br/>Hey what do you know? Stan is a human being too who acts in frustration sometimes. And that does NOT diminish him in any way. Same goes for Novak.

George Bush ran as a uniter? Bwahahaha! <br/><br/>Like anyone would listen to Brooks on politics. He just keeps spreading that rabid right lie about Democrats being big government big spenders when every record shows it is actually the republicans who make more laws to intrude on people's personal lives and also the biggest spenders. <br/><br/>Almost every state run by republicans is deep in debt and lagging on jobs and infrastructure while all the blue states are doing extremely well after republicans crashed the whole world's economy. <br/><br/>Does he really believe the lies tells?

Do you honestly think the government schools are much better? Research some of the failure rates or poor graduation rates at community colleges and four year state colleges. They are also a crime! What would socialism do but make it worse?

What?! I watched and listened with my own eyes and ears while President Obama tried over and over to seek compromise with the Republicans. What he got for his repeated offers was bupkus. Oh, and regarding "the continued unpopularity of Obamacare", it's another myth from the 'go forth and hurt people ' party. The last thing, the very last thing the Democrats need is advice from a Republican shill. I look forward to election night and hope both Rove and Brooks are in that back room at Fox shaking their heads in disbelief. 

59247
No, I would rather see the press finally vet Obama, from his sealed records (what???) to his underwear drawer to his policies, with the same church lady vigor, it's not too late!  Anybody up for it? Pretty please? There is still time to explain this disastrous presidency, even if it is too late to prevent it.

A fiscally irresponsible NeoConservative Republican? I am shocked, shocked!<br/>(With Apologies to Casablanca)<br/><br/>Dubya Bush turned a budget surplus that was on track to eliminate the entire US debt in a little more than a decade to massive deficits. Ronald Reagan ran up more debt in 8 years than all the Presidents before him combined. The last Republican to have a balanced budget was Dwight Eisenhower. Truman, Johnson and Clinton all submitted balanced budgets. Nixon, Reagan, and Both Bushes have never balanced a budget despite NeoCon claims about being sooo concerned about deficits.<br/><br/>Republicans only worry about debt when Democrats are in charge. I guess Rubio follows the Republican pattern. Give him a glass of water.<br/><br/>Data:<br/><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals" title="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals" target="_blank">https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals</a>

What purpose does the public exposure of secret ISIS information serve?  Why don't we just continue to keep it secret and act on the intelligence we gather from it?  It's similar to the period after 9-11 when the "government" published a list of America's most likely terrorist targets so we'd all know which ones they were.  Why help the terrorists in pointing out where we think we're most vulnerable?  Ridiculous!

60051
What about the Obama homestead purchase from questionable characters for below market value? Nothing to see here. Just look at the luxury boat Rubio purchased. While the house burns down, wait lets look at Rubios parking tickets.<br/>What a joke this country has become!

60105
Why won't SOMEONE at the NYT look into this situation with more depth? <br/><br/>Football is a mere symptom of what is really going on in the UA System.  The Board of Trustees are trying to dismantle the entire undergraduate program at UAB in an effort to direct attendance to their "flagship" in Tuscaloosa, which is currently accruing debt at an unsustainable pace (they're up to $1B, while even their endowment is only $632M).<br/><br/>Did I mention that 1/3 of the BOT membership has ties to Bryant Bank, who would stand to profit greatly (or suffer greatly if things go bust) from this expansion to the Tuscaloosa campus?<br/><br/>There's a great investigative story here, if only someone would go after it!

60295
So what's the point here? Rubio is human? He's behaved like many Americans? The New York Times has sold me on the fact that the Republican Party is the  party of the elite and wealthy- this story, along with the one about his violations shows me he's just like us!!! Time to vote Republican!!<br/>While we are on the subject- should we talk about Hillary's violations? Oh that's right, there aren't any when you have a personal driver!!! Oh and the humanity of the boat- how does this compare to John Kerry's tax dodging 72 ft Yacht? I am just curious- if someone who knows about these, please let me know..

60306
"Are we seriously supposed to trust our congressional representatives and some 600 captains of industry to fight for the greater good?!"<br/><br/>The lack of faith is well earned (democrat, republican, independent, 95% of them are schmucks), and I don't think they'll be earning back that faith anytime soon as we continue down this path of diminishing the value of individual citizens for the purpose of fattening the bottoms of our biggest corporations. Truly an obesity epidemic in this country.

60384
So the fact that "we the people" let this law slide thru as part of the real legislation that was intended, means we have caused a major problem with the constitution?!?  I believe there are several "Native Americans" and some Mexicans who would dispute the USA's right to control what we claim to control.

60534
Do you think Christie will ever understand that most Americans, both Dems and Reps, think he is a LOSER??? Most of us are tired of his lies and hot air. We don't trust him or respect him. <br/><br/>We are the kind of people he is trying to win over yet he refuses to shut up (as he so often tells others). <br/><br/>So Christie, I will tell you what you have stated too often to count: SHUT UP!!! GO AWAY. WE ARE SICK OF YOU!

60610
For goodness sake David what political world have you been watching these past 6+ years??  As we saw there was absolutely no way Republicans were going to work with the President for anything he wanted.  Compromise was out of the question.  Republicans were proud to say their goal was to make him a one-term president.  How were they going to do this?  By stifling all the initiatives he had, of course.   Obama moved to the right to compromise on health care to get Republican support that was never forthcoming even though Obamacare is Heritage Think Tank invention!    Similar things are true for Cap and Trade and the budget in general.   <br/><br/>When you say that "base mobilization strategy is a legislative disaster. If the next president hopes to pass any actual laws, he or she will have to create a bipartisan governing majority."  You are kidding yourself especially for the Democratic nominee who can expect virtually no compromise whatsoever.    This is not a two-party problem.   As is borne out by opinion polls, moderates and liberals appreciate compromise conservatives want it "my way or the highway" (have you ever listened to Fox News or AM radio?).     Sadly, as we have seen during this presidency anything that left offers is taken but nothing is forthcoming from the right.  Why would a new presidency change this?

60713
"So, how did Republicans get a reputation for responsibility? They bought it, of course!"<br/><br/>They claimed it.  That's all it takes when nobody tells them otherwise.  It really helps it stick when the opposing political force then tries to convince the public it too has the same "free" market priorities.

Really? How about his connections to the billionaire who is funding him. Please!

Obama cut the deficit in half? Bwa-ha-ha! Only after he exploded it to over $1 trillion annually. $1.3 trillion to be exact. And don't assign 2009 to Bush - that deficit occurred after Obama's $700b "porkulus" program. You lefties are factually challenged.

"Dogged by Questionable Financial Decisions"?<br/><br/>At what point, will the political dialogue stop referring to these escapades as personal "financial decisions" and instead identify them as part of the systemically toxic effect that floods on money -- much of it 'dark' and semi-secret -- are having on our political processes (and politicians) at ALL levels?  It's our very process that's corrupt--and corrupted!<br/><br/>You can't read the news on any given day without reading stories of financial improprieties (Christie, Silver, Skelos, Bruno, Heastie, Rowland, Hastert), people in disgrace getting windfall financial deals (cf. Petraeus and various regulators going to work for the banks and law firms they were supposed to be regulating and/or as lobbyists (Cantor &amp; co) !),  or outright crookedness and corruption (cf. most of the names on the list above!)<br/><br/>This isn't a question of personal peccadilloes, or even individual corruption --- although that IS a big part of the story -- but rather of pervasive, systemic corruption that's rotting our political processes and the fabric of our nation!

"Hubris, and Sputnik, Doomed the Edsel"  Really? I was just 22 days from turning 10 years old when the Edsel was produced in September 1957.<br/>Michael Beschloss probably wasn't around then.  I truly doubt that the two elements of failure "Hubris, and Sputnik" were the primary reasons for the Edsel's demise. I remember the comments of friends, family, school teachers and the parent of my friends.<br/>The cold, brutal truth is that even the then current loyal owners of Ford cars and trucks thought it was one "damned ugly automobile".   The Edsel just didn't appeal to anyone.  It was just ugly.  The grill was ugly.  The wheels were ugly. The Edsel was ugly.  It's still ugly.<br/>I liked it! I was 10!<br/>PS: My dad owned 1954, 1956, 1958 and 1959 Fords. The latter was a peach and cream color Ford Fairlane or Galaxy 500 convertible.  I currently own a 2013 metallic red Mustang convertible. And I'm buying a new 2015. I had a 2005 and a 2008 as well. What I'm trying to say is that sometimes Ford gets it right.

What?! Mr Rubio didn't set up a "foundation" to collect "donations" from foreign governments? He bought a house for his mother and a 24 foot boat? Scandalous.

Was this really necessary? Clearly Hope's behavior off the field could improve, and might profit from a serious reprimand by her coach. But who profits from placing her in a negative spotlight? Certainly not the US team just beginning their latest challenge for the World Cup! Surely the coach and the team can be allowed the responsibility in this case. Freedom of the press does encourage both the media and the public to revel in mud-wrestling.

61308
Is this what I need to know to be part of an informed electorate? The fact that cocky people overspend and hustle to cover debts while driving fast in leased luxury cars is a known known.<br/><br/>Neither Marco Rubio nor any one among the GOP candidates will get my vote because those thriving in the GOP club disregard the common good, elevate the Randian virtue of selfishness, and, astonishingly, take a vow to Norquist (say what, truncate their oath of office with an inflexible vow?!). <br/><br/>I want accounting of a useful sort. Help us count the ways we can revitalize our nation for all. Be specific.

61363
Seriously?  We've gotten to the point that a candidate's failure to properly manage his/her personal life is a badge to be worn and is merely symbolic of the true middle class?  Wrong! He did not pay his bills on time (he entered the foreclosure process) and spends in a manner that speaks to his values (it's important that you THINK I'm successful even though I'm not).  He's not a bad person but the President of this country needs to demonstrate a value system that sets the bar higher and serves as a good role model for all the classes.

When is the US (or when are writers for the NYT) going to get over lumping everyone over the age of _____ (pick an age) as part of one group? Asking them to somehow say something representative of the group of people aged ___ to ___? Get over it! We are as individual in our experiences, our health, our interests, as anyone else!!! Would a reporter ask 6 people between the ages of 25 and 35 to explain that age group and its challenges, interests, etc., to the rest of us? It isn't a group, and 6 people can't speak for everyone in it. Call me when you want to talk to people over 65 about our lives.

So, you're hosting both the 5th and the 8th grade parties with the school, or are these family/friend parties?  (The latter, I think.)  You don't have to host *any* of that, you know.<br/><br/>Or you could just host a 5th grade party, and that way reward the youngest who has been a bit overshadowed this year.<br/><br/>My end-of-year tradition was to join with dear friends with two kids near my son's age (one in his grade, one the year behind), to go to a favorite eating spot on the Hudson River.  We started to do that also after the first day of the school year as well, to sweeten up the return to school not just the end of school!

What do you mean, THIS YEAR'S contest? We're going to have a presidential election in just under 19 months!! Give it a rest. Just because the media have a lot of space to fill, whether its on a page, a website, or a television channel, doesn't mean there's any content worth following. Four years ago, all we were hearing about were Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich, and Sarah Palin. Or was that eight years ago? Is Ben Carson the new Herman Cain? The new Alan Keyes? Bring back Quemoy, Matsu, and Sister Souljah.

62289
I want to know who's going to jail for the crimes committed against Kalief Browder?  Financial awards do nothing to stem the atrocious behavior and institutional racism.  The city won't even feel a $100 million award.  Everyone who participated in putting this young man in prison, from the arresting officer to the district attorney, to the guards to the prison warden should be put on trial and those who forgot about him or dehumanized him or treated him like the Nazis treated the Jews in the concentration camps should be made felons for this atrocity.  The problem persists because no one is truly held accountable.  Sorry isn't good enough this time!

"People have no problem buying cars from industrial juggernauts"?! Start with Ralph Nader's classic, "Unsafe at Any Speed". Then fast forward to the present, catastrophic airbag recall.

Are you insane? A plot?? The VMRO DPMNE party has been turning the country into a mix of Neonazi/Neocommunard distopia! Every day people are getting threatened and fired for speaking out! Every day! You talked to whom, to the comfortable fans of the ruling VMRO DPMNE, who hijacked everything Macedonian and now whenever someone resorts to the mildest of criticisms they label them a "Soroswhore", a secret service agent or a traitor? Have you all lost your minds? The ruling party has privatized the state and made it a private property of their party, they're basically a mafia, 400 000 have left the country since 1992, and from 2008-2014 a total of 5,8 BILLION USD have been illegally pumped out of the country! The leaked tapes tell of bribes, threats of violence, tearing of private property, threats of death, money laundering (just the sum of the money laundered with the SinoHydro deal amounts to 300 MILLION EUR!!!), framing of political opponents, massive wiretaps of even outspoken liberally minded citizens... the list is endless! Russian pipeline? Oh yes it must be that Russian pipeline, which isn't even signed by Russia and Turkey! Brilliant logic!

If both people in this current relationship are bigamists, as the writer suggests, are they criminals? (This of course is germane to western thought for in other parts of the world multiple mates to one person is allowed.)<br/><br/>The term bigamy specifically refers to the act of having two or more spouses simultaneously-the unwritten understanding is that the extra spouses are alive, not dead. <br/><br/>Love endures in life and is reminiscent after the beloved has died, and even if divorce severs the union.  Loving another isn't limited to one and does not preclude love after a mate has died.  <br/><br/>In this century a Christian widow doesn't don black for the rest of her life nor eschew social obligations -or (horrors!) turn her eyes from males not her relatives.   Nor is it India where the wife is set ablaze on the funeral pyre....<br/><br/>It appears that there is some feeling-as silly as that is- of guilt  going on here, where no guilt should be ascribed.  Love is love. Embrace it.  Love embraces all  and should include all.  <br/><br/>On the basis of this writer's  opinion, I leave two rhetorical questions-to the writer and to the readers:<br/><br/>If you -as a parent- watch a child die, and death happens, do you refuse to have additional children? Or feel guilty for having more children?<br/><br/>If your parents die long after your childhood, do you call yourself orphan?

62625
Hmm really? This requires abortion clinics to have higher standards and be (at least 30 miles) from a hospital emergency room in case something goes wrong?! And that is a right wing agenda? REALLY?!  Sorry but this doesnt seem that extreme at all and just something the left wants to create as something relevent. What about the left's argument they didnt want back alley grimy abortions to take place ?!

Lots of parties - not stressful?<br/><br/>What are you, extroverts or something?<br/><br/>Granted, some folks just love this stuff.  In my district, it's how parent volunteers can put their stamp on things.  Ice cream social - yeah!  Pool party - yeah!  <br/><br/>Then add skeighty-eight different little family celebrations - yeah!<br/><br/>Nooo!  It's not just about emails and deadlines, it's about other hobbies, down time, and spending time with, y'know - real friends instead.

Why live in Texas?  Better yet, let's not visit Texas.  And certainly do not send your children to Texas Universities.  Texas blocks safe abortions for college women and yet they have open carry guns  on campus! Texas thinks men who carry guns are more in need of the state's protection than  women are  in need of the state's protecting her right to a safe abortion.

Jeb Bush has a button? FYI - he has not announced his candidacy. He is the Candidate but  Not a Candidate - as yet! Right now he is just too busy filling his coffers because once he announces his money-making machine will have regulations attached ( not that it makes much of a difference ). Just that the beans will have a different ring to it.

Low-level splurges include an $80,000 boat? Doesn't sound middle class! And his wife only paid her debt when she was caught. He only paid back the state after he was caught. Getting caught and paying up is not the same as being honest. This is not the behavior of "many other people of his generation" and certainly not of anybody with integrity.

If you're grossed out by under arm hair on women, I wonder what you think about - men who have protruding nose hair, ear hair? How about neck and back hair on men.  Got hair around your navel or on your lower back? Gross! Hair on your bottom - gross.<br/><br/>Why is there no societal pressure for men to eliminate all of their gross hair?  In the world of gross body hair, men have it all!

What kind of educational background in gerontology and experiences with older people do the "managers" of facilities with these kinds of discriminatory practices have?<br/><br/>Robert Butler, a renowned psychiatrist in the area of aging, wrote multiple editions of a wonderful textbook called "Aging and Mental Health: Positive Psychosocial and Biomedical Approaches." I used it in the gerontology course I taught to students going into the health professions. <br/><br/>Butler says that the most important interview question to ask each staff member (from top to bottom) is whether there was an older person/persons in their life that had an important effect on them, and to describe some of their experiences with older people.  Why? Because research indicates those who work best with older adults had positive experiences in their own lives with older people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some of the managers and staff who "run" housing facilities for older people come from a hardline business perspective and think of themselves as CEOs and executives in charge, who are know-it-alls and consider themselves  higher status than the residents who pay their salaries.<br/><br/>Empathy is the key, such as being able to grasp what an older person is feeling, what it is like to lose functioning, and how to communicate imaginatively, esp. with older adults having cognitive issues.<br/><br/>What is one of the worst things to do when working with older adults? Take away what little sense of control they have left. Good for the activists! 

63789
Is the state of Texas going to vote on every medical procedure in the book to decide in what type of facility it should be carried out? Of course not! How many of the Texas  representatives are doctors? How many are women? Are women so disenfranchised that they need a permission slip from the Texas government (where they have only 21% representation) to decide what happens within their body? women, sisters, fight for your rights.

Really? Because the privileged class has to pay an additional Medicare tax of 3.8% on their entire income, to cover ACA? For those who make &lt;$250K, this doesn't apply. The privileged class also have quite a bit of "investment income," on which they were paying just 15% in federal income tax; now it is 20%. The most privileged are the hedge fund managers whose humungous incomes up to in $billions are (still) being treated as "carried interest" and were paying just 15% in federal tax; since 2013, it is 20%, plus 3.8% in Medicare tax. (Their Soc. Sec. tax is minuscule, as they only pay on up to $117K of their total income in 2014) The privileged high income folks have no reason to applaud Obamacare, other than for altruistic reasons.<br/><br/>You may have insurance from work. ACA doesn't affect you, other than that they cannot cancel when catastrophic healthcare expense would otherwise may drive you into bankruptcy. But your children &amp; grandchildren will benefit from Obamacare if their jobs don't provide health insurance. If their incomes are too low, closer to minimum wage, the cost per person will be only around $25/month, or even less for family coverage.<br/><br/>True Obamacare passed with so much Republican opposition and watered down to a very costly system, benefitting the hospitals, insurance &amp; drug companies, along with the near poor, at the expense of taxpayers. But it could be fixed in steps.<br/><br/>Obamacare is as great as Soc Sec &amp; Medicare!

"Are there any other laws issued by Texas regulating medical procedures?"<br/><br/>Of course there are!  If you read the article, you should have seen that the law requires abortion clinics to meet the same standards as other out-patient surgical centers.  Clearly, they have regulations for out-patient surgical centers; they are just requiring abortion clinics to meet those standards.

Did you even read the article? The kid was dumped in solitary confinement for TWO YEARS without even seeing a judge! That's arguably the worst travesty of justice I've read about in a long, long time. Safety net? Seriously?

Why is it often so hard for people in the service industry to put themselves in their customers' shoes? Yes, the room actually does need to be quiet in order for guests to be able to sleep, duh! That is basically the point of a room with a bed in it.

and alcohol, and guns, and guns, and did i mention guns???? How many children are accidentally killed in the Texas, and across this country from guns as opposed to abortion.  Why doesn't the legislature debate and prepare legislation to protect a read threat to public health??? Don't event get me started about gas tax and infrastructure development!!!!  Oh, no lets spend legislative debate time on this issue as opposed to something really life threatening and important!

Please, all these comments and nobody wants to talk about the fact that Iceland has not only succeeded by letting the banks collapse but also by holding the banks' creditors hostage?  Capital controls for almost seven years!  Without them everybody, including the Dear Professor, would acknowledge that the economy could not have recovered.  And now, as they prepare to drop the controls, they are going to demand a 40% exit fee.  Governmental extortion is a wonderful thing to watch.  Certainly far superior to actually, you know, paying people.  Greece could learn from that!  (Except virtually everyone has already escaped with their capital.)

'please cut out the "denying reproductive healthcare" meme'<br/><br/>So if a woman is told that her fetus is not viable and will die before it is full term, she should just wait around until the fetus dies?  In Ireland doctors were afraid of violating abortion laws, so they forced a woman to do just that.  By the time the heartbeat of the fetus stopped the woman was too septic to be saved.<br/><br/>I call that denial of healthcare!!

Since when does the AMA fight "common sense medical standards"?  Or didn't you know that the AMA opposes these laws.<br/><br/>The upgrades are a solution in search of a problem to solve - just a political way to put clinics out of business.<br/><br/>The AMA is worried about girls and women showing up in ERs after botched back alley abortions.  Believe me - they have good reason to be worried.  <br/><br/>I have been an adult since before Roe vs Wade so I know what happens when abortions are not available or illegal.  Younger folks who don't understand should pick up a good history book on the subject.<br/><br/>Repeating the mistakes of the past is not productive!!

Michelle Obama and her school lunch program (seen some of the photos of the food?  Ugh!) are responsible for the food fed to "under fed" children through school breakfast and lunch programs.  Be aware that Michelle's children have gourmet lunches which in no way resemble the average child's school lunch offerings.  The poor quality and unappealing aspects of the food provided free for "underfed children (what about all the anti childhood obesity programs out there?)  are  strictly due to the meddling of Democrat Michelle Obama.

Marco Rubio? I will not vote for him. I will try to explain, why:<br/>1)He was a Catholic, then he became a Mormon, then a Baptist, then again Catholic. If you change the faith so many times, it can easily forget about your political promises!<br/>2) Repeatedly changed his position on environmental policy and other social problems. FLIP-FLOPER?<br/>3) Used his non-profit foundations for private purposes: traveling, made expensive purchases...<br/>Marco Rubio is not a candidate for typical intelligent representative of mid class.

Is it any wonder that the approval rate of Congress has fallen to historical lows of under 10%? It amazes me that politicians like Chuck Shumer &amp; Ted Cruz claim to be fighting for the middle class since both of them are in the deep monied pockets of Wall St &amp; big banks. Ted Cruz is the most hypocritical politician of the lot since he is backed by billionaire hedgefund CEO, Robert Mercer, who happily uses every tax scheme on the books for his firm to escape paying $6 billion in taxes between 2000 &amp; 2013 as well as loving the “carried interest” tax loophole for hedgefund managers allowing them to pay 0 taxes on their exorbitant salaries. Mercer has Ted Cruz as his lackey to make sure this governmental hamhock pork stays on the federal books.<br/><br/>At the same time, Ted Cruz along with Paul Ryan, backed by Koch Industries, were the boy geniuses behind the proposal to do away with the home mortgage deduction, child tax credit &amp; earned income tax credit, which are the few tax deductions for middle class workers. This just illustrates how deeply disconnected the Congress is from the struggles &amp; desires of the populace it is tasked with serving. Paul Ryan also backed a bill to cut Corporate tax rates by  $500 billion annually, supported by the Heritage Foundation. This would coincide with a bold move to slash $177 billion in entitlement payments including privatizing Social Security, thus decimating the social safety net. The plutocrats own the American Dream all to themselves, tsk-tsk!

 So the capture of Ramadi  "  punctured the administration's description that the group ( ISIS ) was on the defensive  ?  "  Well, it's about time !   Perhaps the word ' description ' is a little weaker  than the truth . Try substituting lie or naive belief  for   the word ' description  .  '

In order to enact such a law, with a stated goal “ to provide the highest quality of care to women seeking abortions and to protect the health and welfare of women seeking abortions,” shouldn't the court have had to prove that the Texan facilities providing surgical abortions are unsafe and thus in need of regulation? Before making such sweeping and consequential decisions effecting the women of Texas, shouldn't the legislators have had to show some scientific evidence demonstrating a unsafe, hazardous conditions in which women were actually harmed?! It appears that the Fifth Circuit Court conveniently overlooked the fact that a legal abortion is one of the safest procedures a woman can have, certainly far safer than pregnancy itself. <br/><br/>The situation seems analogous to measures to curb voting, another darling of the conservative party. Pretend there is a problem, slap on one's own political "fix" through the courts, and then pat oneself on the back for protecting freedom, liberty and women.

What else than a beep,seated animosity and hatred of Islam and Islamism explains the joy and exaltation of western media re the outcom e of Turkish elections ?<br/>I can think of nothing else !<br/>Conversely I cannot think of any valid reason for that hatred and blatant enmity nor see any Western advantage and profit emanating from that.<br/>It is a sure prescription for ruinous future conflicts and a su re formula for engulfing future generations. In pointless, futile but highly destructive wars and retrogressive and hostile relations.<br/>The West better reconsider the long term outcome of such a state of affairs it is nurturing  and recall that Islam can  and  will ultimately  respond far more vigorously in a negative manner of no interest or benefit to either of the two communities!

So you're literally messing with me,  right?   You don't really have trouble understanding teen slang,  right?   RIGHT? <br/><br/>I love my kids' slang.   I can't explain it,  but it makes me swoon.   My 17 year old,  teased relentlessly,  will dramatically beg "Let me live!"  in between the "literallies."   My 15 year old uses RIP as an equal opportunity cry of dismay.  I find them both utterly charming. <br/><br/>I did have to ask what "shipping"  meant.   Shipping the pair, apparently a creation of fan fiction,  in which fiction is recast to make desired couples fall in love.   Okay.

I think it must by pretty darn painful  to get a spear pulled out of your side? Also an animal, be it a dragon or something else, doesn't understand that you are hurting it in order to help. They just see you hurting them. I would say Drogon turned round in rage as to say: "Mum what do you think your doing?!" If Dany would have started plucking more spears out, she would have not only caused Drogon more pain, but also she would have risked giving the Harpies time to through more spears!

Does 40 years in solitary confinement not constitute " Cruel and unusual punishment"?  Is there no decency or law left in the United States?  Everyday  every article I read every news cast I watch parades before my eyes over and over the complete total and utter loss of any vestiges of the country I once knew. Does no one else care or see that we have lost all of our beliefs in practice? and that the constitution is nothing more than mere words?..  Help me out here..  40 years alone everyday for a common murder?..!!

WHAT'S IN A NAME?  The Obamacare case before the Supreme Court hinges on the definition of a single word:  State.  The Oxford Dictionary definition of state includes NATIONS, as in "the member States of the United Nations."  When was the last time that one of the extremist ideologues checked the dictionary?  Better yet, when was the last time that their more enlightened colleagues checked the dictionary definition of the word, "State?"  That should lay the entire matter to rest once and for all!  My greatest fear is that all 9 Justices will not have done their homework.  Perhaps the government's attorney will bring that evidence to their attention.  But I wouldn't be on it.  They look for arcane and abstruse explanations, when the solution is staring them right in the face.  A nation cannot be a state; but a state can be a nation.

Is is not possible to find fault with multiple entities or have we reached a point where everyone has to choose a side? And that's it. Period.<br/><br/>The teens who crashed the party were wrong. The white parent hurling racial slurs was absolutely wrong. She's an adult for crying out loud! The cop who wrestled the teen girl who was invited to the party, no less, was wrong. Then to point a loaded gun on the teen guys who instinctively rushed to the teen girl's aid, was totally wrong and out of control. There was no danger to his life whatsoever and he demonstrated a serious inability to control a situation peacefully. His job is to defuse not escalate. <br/><br/>Yes, the  incident is still being investigated. But we do know enough to identify the real danger. And I personally fear a racist parent and an unhinged cop more than I do rowdy teens in swimtrunks and flip flops.

67197
Oh my lord, are you still banging that tired old drum? Everyone thinks the officer was in the wrong, even the officer himself! He resigned and the department said his actions were indefensible, so your "the police are always right" line just doesn't work here.<br/>Let it go, and when a situation comes up where police officers do things that look unsavoury, but are indeed important and correct to do, you can get behind them and not look like a complete idiot.

First, is the calorie count right?  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and non-fat greek yogurt.  Also, didn't have a chile pepper so used red pepper flakes.  There was a lot of sauce left over which I plan to use with some veggies like cauliflower and potatoes.  The flavor and texture were very good, the chicken thighs cooked through nicely.  Loved it but definitely not the calories!  It also took me about 2 hours---so plan accordingly.

Is there any wonder on why marijuanna has remained a class 1 drug for the last 70 years with Big Pharma pulling the strings?<br/><br/>When you can grow your own drug in your backyard,so much for billions in inflamation drugs etc and we still  don't know all that it can do.<br/><br/>Strange with all the R&amp;D  no supposed tests of marijuanna in those 70 years with any results.<br/><br/>Oh right!  its natural and been around for 10,000 years in human history.

Was this a case of "just resign and you can keep your pension"?  Probably.  I tell you I wouldn't want to be a police officer though.  All it takes is one controversy and your career is done.  Too many spoiled brat children that don't like listening to orders.  Yeah he prob went a little overboard...   Now when you throw a racial powder keg in - it makes it more intense.  Serious question though - had this been a 16 year old white male in a rural area that he pinned down for not listening - would he be resigning?  Would he be at risk for being fired!

I agree with Mark that we need more small farmers, but how to do that?<br/><br/>I have long wanted to "put my money where my mouth is," but I don't know how to do it.  I don't have much money.  But I'd love to pool it with other small to medium sums into an investment group that invests in young or starting organic farmers, especially ones near me. And the major investment is land and equipment, often far out of reach of those ready and able to do the work. <br/><br/>Does anyone know of such a group?  Or even how to do set one up?  Thanks!

Standard foods to strictly avoid?  Red meat for its high methionine content, malignant cells use that byproduct of meat to thrive.  NAC, sulfur compounds are very useful, capsule, from the heath food store or off the web, very anti cancer. I did independent research for quite a while when my family members and dog had cancer.  Google the generic anti acid, Cimidatine (spelling may be off here), students found it dissolved ca tumors when they were studying for gastric reflux, sold at pharmacies.  Please research this info a bit and see what these substances are useful, also sulfurophane capsules (broccoli seed extract) can be ordered online or from  good health food stores. Sulfur and its products are vital agents active against cancer. God bless you as you come into your complete recovery!

How many times have I seen demands for “three years experience” in a technology or product that was just released last month?!<br/><br/>As someone with a BS CSc I’ve worked with very few others.  Most of my fellow employees have, maybe, BAs and lucked into a tech job that was their springboard.  Message: 4-5 year BS not needed!  At the same time, there’s never been any incentive for a Masters.  Employers offer no credit for or recognition of it.<br/><br/>So lets drop the American Exceptionalism myth.  Any skill set, once it’s left the lab and commoditized into a “job” can be done anywhere on the planet.  The choice to employ Americans, and it is a choice, needs to be policy at the Federal and State levels.<br/><br/>Unemployment?  Poverty? Rising Crime?  Your choice.

What's everybody all excited about? It only took 50 years! We mustn't rush these things! Switching to the serious tone this outrage deserves, how many child victims have grown old and died waiting for justice, for the shame to be lifted from them and assigned where it belongs? In any other setting, thousands of serial child sex abusers would have been prosecuted and gone to jail decades ago. This Pope deserves the admiration of the world. He is finally reforming the Catholic Church and bringing it into the modern era. Bravo.

Great work, but I wonder how many people are capable of grasping the concept of people migrating across thousands of miles, over thousands of years, and in the process building the foundation of what we have today?<br/><br/>I've been working on the family history for many years and even within a time span measured in hundreds, rather than thousands of years, I'm always amazed at the number of people who don't understand the context of their ancestors' lives. For example, that many of their ancestors were illiterate, and that English is a modern language in the overall scheme of things.<br/><br/>I'm sometimes reminded of a story I heard years ago, about a school district somewhere in the south that was debating whether to teach French in their schools.  One of the audience allegedly stood up and said "If English was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me!".

Are we kidding? 400+ trainers? Please forgive me, but the Iraqi army is not trainable. The Marines in Anbar had good luck putting Sunni fighters on the payroll. They were reliable fighters.

When does this end? From a teenager begging for his life, yelling hands up! Don't shoot! to a trespass in a private pool, attacking a security guard and brawling, yet pleading another fictitious victimization; can't we see what's happening? Any effort to defend ourselves against cascading disorder including alarming increases in inner city shooting and lawlessness is suffering a scapegoating strategy around the word 'racism'. Saddest of all, those who are most vulnerable will suffer most from the retreat suffered upon law enforcement.

I am vaguely remembering some project - maybe a decade ago - with National Geographic - it was on TV - where they were studying DNA from all over the world - and traced  huge numbers back to a common ancestor perhaps it was in Kazahkastan? (I also remember them telling the Havasupai Indians that they were descendants of this person - and they were very clear - "you have your story, we have ours. Don't you tell us who we are."<br/>Does anyone recall that "definitive" study and how it relates to this one? Looking forward to some erudite responses!

How about a shift in workplace culture that would allow, without negative perceptions, people to leave at a reasonable hour so that they could have time for meaningful exercise rather than plodding along at their desks? Or longer lunch breaks (or restoring any lunch break!) for activity mid-day? This treadmill desk fad seems yet another ruse to further the expansion of work into one's entire day.

ANY other organization? The US Juvenile Detention System has more allegations of underage sexual and physical abuse in a month than all the churches combined have had in the last 10 years. The Good folks of Texas actually ran two of their facilities as pedophile rings for money in 2007! As a US citizen, it doesn't appear you are so good at holding your secular organizations responsible either.

SAFE?  Please, someone explain to me, how eating food sprayed with Roundup (Glyphosate) is safe. Sure, the Corn, Cotton, Sugar beets or Soy is safe and lives because it has been Genetically Engineered to handle it.  The weeds and Humans have not been genetically altered. We are being poisoned and dying.  Roundup stays in the ground and is not flushed out of our produce.  If you try to tell me its safe, please head over to your favorite poison store ( Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart, etc...) pick up some roundup, sprinkle a little on your veggies and enjoy.  Better yet, make yourself a coolaide and drink up.  When your kids get cancer, you can only blame yourself. Our Government lies to us! ALL THE TIME!

John, what did she do that was disrespectful? Her white classmates were across the street and they were not harassed. She lived in the neighborhood, she was not fighting, she was not using profanity, she was not talking to the officer until he grabbed her, she had her family's pool pass, ...  what did she do that was disrespectful? If she was white, she would not have been targeted at the pool by the officer.<br/>If you are grabbed and taken to the ground by an officer for no reason, you will have some words to say. Her words were "I want to call my mother! You are hurting me!"

71842
What would have happened if all of the victims of this officer's rage were white?  Where are the black officers?  Why are'nt there any?  This is the problem, the lack of diversity.  Diversity causes all races to learn tolerance for one another.  Fix the problem!! It seems to be all over America, so why not start with the police departments. Who is policing the police?  I think that every police department in America should integrate, diversify and tolerate all of the citizens in order to determine when there is a real threat, not simply look at the color of our skin and draw a gun at blacks who run away.  <br/><br/>Disenfranchise the tyrants, racists and out of order people with guns and badges so the real police can do their jobs gracefully.  Why don't the police carry guns in some countries and their violent crime rates are lower?   They learn to work through situations, not just go for guns if the person on the  receiving end of the bullet is black.  <br/><br/>This young black girl, most likely knows of someone who has been framed and jailed, or beaten and killed  by police with no punishment as most blacks  know about that I am familiar with.  Whites do not have the same experience so many cannot understand the outrage.  Without social media, there was always coverup with 0 prosecutions throughout history.   Now a young black female who posed no threat to the cop has become a victim of outrageous policing.   Clean up the forces of racial hate group members and sympathizers.  

71847
And what planet are you from?  We have seen our children and brothers shot by the police.  We are black people.  I see you!!   <br/><br/>When you walk a mile in the shoes of blacks who have been kidnapped, hanged, raped, murdered, buildings burned and deprived of equal rights from the time we were brought here, then you can understand the term tolerance. Blacks are not shooting police officers.  When was the last time a 15 year old unarmed girl in a bikini harmed a police officer.    The Officer had the job to protect and to serve.  He must perform professionally regardless of the color of the person, not ruin their lives and not even take the blame for his actions.  Fire him and take his pension as if he were a black man.     WHO ARE THEY PROTECTING AND WHO ARE THEY SERVING?

What if you created the machine to do your work, but by law your creation is owned by the corporation that you used to work for before they fired you and replaced you with your robotic invention?<br/><br/>Americans have been working their way out of jobs for decades, on the premise that our 'exceptionalism' and munificent system of 'trickle down' will simply create new ways to employ our labor.    Our corporations have accumulated and used the 'intellectual capital' of generations of workers and given it to China in exchange for opening a few markets.    Now China is giving them a lesson in how to shove it!<br/><br/>The corps and their Congress are simply finding ways to insure that the effluent flows down hill from their estates into the backyards of we, the 99%.

To all your "what if's" I would simply say, so what?<br/>In a true democracy none of that would matter. 50 years ago Turkey was doing a fair job of inclusive democracy as prescribed by Ataturk. Even at its infancy Democracy in Turkey had room for all. It is only in the last decades it took a turn for the worse under Erdogan. He got checked! So did others before him who wanted to depart from the path to full democracy. Adnan Menderes comes to mind. <br/><br/>Democracy in Turkey will always be a challenge given 98 percent or more of the population being Muslim. Then again, Democracy is never easy even after 239 years United States of America still struggles with trying to perfect it.<br/><br/>The fact that last election includes 90 women elected to the Parliament gives me hope.<br/>It is work in progress. Don't give up on Turkey yet. Be supportive.

Why would we discuss "the right to life of the unborn child," when the stated purpose of this law is to protect the health of women getting abortions?<br/><br/> Oh, wait!  Do you mean that these laws weren't passed to  provide "Texas women choosing abortion the highest standard of health care?"   That your state representatives are just pretending to care about women's health and safety, and their real goal is to protect "right to life of the unborn child" by making it as difficult as possible for women in Texas to get a legal abortion?   Do you mean to tell me that pro-life legislators in Texas haven't been totally honest and forthright about the real intent of this law?  <br/><br/>Who'da thunk it.

A pathetic and sentimental feeling about pregnancy and motherhood combines with religiosity ("You're pregnant? God made that precious baby") and misogyny ("You're pregnant? You should be punished! After all, to get that way, you had sex") to form a volatile mix that drives the anti-abortion rights crowd. Unfortunately, wherever legislators curtail safe and legal abortions, they destroy the freedom and autonomy of women. <br/><br/>We who are called "pro-choice" are, in reality, simply "pro-women's freedom." We recognize that whenever the State denies a woman access to a legal, safe abortion, that woman's reproductive freedom ceases.<br/><br/>As an aside, it's sad to realize that in a purportedly modern era, the reality is that mostly male legislators sit around and make laws about a woman's body.

Doesn't New Jersey have publicly financed magnet schools or charter schools?  Here in Charleston, S.C., we have a multitude of both to attract students with strong interests and talents in the arts and sciences, military and Montessori and more.  Our latest is the "Allegro Charter School of Music" for grades 6 - 9.  How I wish I were 11 years old again!  On the other hand, having been employed much of my life as a writer, I know I would have thrived at "The Academy for Young Writers." Go ahead and arch your eyebrows, Mr. Luettgen. I'm sorry if New Jersey offers only cookie-cutter schools, but I suspect that is not the case.

The one who crossed a glacier in Alaska – didn’t estimate the time it would take and found himself crossing formidable crevasses in the fading light of evening, and he even took a dog with him; risking both lives. <br/><br/>This was the same guy who climbed a high tree to take in the effects of a severe wind storm. The same guy who was trapped overnight on a snow-covered mountain (Shasta) with no provisions and had to take refuge in fumaroles where steam had created pockets in the snow. The same guy who climbed what’s called the ice cone that forms in winter at the base of Upper Yosemite Falls. Not to mention going behind – between the ice cold falling water and the rock of these same falls where a change in the direction of the falling water could sweep him to his death in seconds. Thrill seeker? <br/><br/>Oh that was John Muir!

The question "what more can be done"? <br/><br/>Station a meaningful number of US and other NATO troops in front-line states (Baltics, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania). Enough that breaching this would require all-out war, modest enough that it will be not an existential threat to Russia. Most of these countries cry for this. Today's Russia policy is based on fudging ("just one or two armored battalions on a vacation trip abroad here and there is not really a war, let's keep business running as usual").<br/><br/>Help those countries get the ability to bite back, if necessary, on their own. Poland is considering the purchase of longer range precise weapons (Tomahawks, JASSM-ER). This requires US Government approval.<br/><br/>What scares people in Poland is the possibility that Russia will "just nibble a bit, just mess up a bit yet another country" and gamble that NATO/US will not risk militarily response (those nukes Russians mention recently so often!) to an "not quite an all-out attack". If the front-line countries have own capabilities to bite back, everybody will be safer for this. Including Russians, less temptation.<br/><br/>Yes, Russians have no sane reason to attack Poland or other NATO countries.  But they apparently today work not to conquer, but just to mess up. And this gotta be stopped. It was nice in Europe here for the last 25 years, digging out of last century's horrors, and I would much rather continue developing my country than fight people in unmarked uniforms running around.

Those are the only options?  Risking your life or getting overweight sitting at a desk. Lots of people, including myself, do what we love without risking our lives or gaining weight!

What does it do for anyone??  It allows those institutions with which he was associated to hold their heads up and not have to shelter and support this man!  It's not about him.  It's about those at UCL who don't want to be associated with these ideas.  And I do think it helps women considering careers in science to see that he is out of step with the majority.

Can I suggest trying the ultra-thin lenses again? My vision is -5.00 (outstandingly myopic), and I'm wearing a fairly large pair of glasses now. They are pricey -- my lenses alone cost around $400 (regardless of frame - I also buy glare-free), but are well worth it if you figure the number of days/years you get out of them (especially compared to any other article of clothing). Plus, I'm not wearing coke bottles!

Homosexuals proud of decency?  Hell yes!  Actually, now more than ever.  <br/><br/>I agree with the flavor of "Michael Manhattan" comments.  I, for one, didn't want to be assimilated; I didn't want to marry, adopt, and pretend to be just like heterosexuals.  I didn't want to become another ornament of diversity on the Christmas tree.  The margin of society suited me.  It still does.  <br/><br/>Was Stonewall really the beginning of Gay Liberation?  I think not.  Ordinary gay people had been living lives of proud deviance for quite some time before Stonewall happened.  A lot of us weren't so brave as to announce it openly, but what about the Mattachine Society, started in 1950?   What about the soldiers and sailors discharged for deviance after WWII and built a community where they found themselves in places like SF and NYC?  <br/><br/>I am also cautious about concluding that homosexuality has been accepted once and for all.  I certainly hope we do not see a regression back to earlier periods of flagrant discrimination, where police and mental health authorities flaunt their power.  But it isn't inconceivable that such a thing might happen--differently, of course, than the last time, but with a similar result.

How many people take PPIs because they don't want to make lifestyle and diet changes? From what I've seen, far too many. people grab the pill because its the quick and easy solution, but the answer to health lies in loosing weight and changing your eating habits. Our grandparents knew this, so why have we forgotten? Reduce simple carbs, quit overeating, loose weight, don't eat anything after 7pm, quit the daily drinking (that will help with the weight loss too!),and  take a moderate walk of about 10-15 minutes following meals, followed by an hour of staying upright, sitting or standing. These lifestyle practices will improve your health in so many ways. Quit hurting, quit grabbing for pills, quit spending your money on "cures". You can do it!

A "cheap thrill"? No.  Watching TV or judging others is a cheap thrill. We should all have the courage to follow our bliss. When i was a child, we used to jump off an 80 quarry cliff into the deep water below. Now, kids are hovered over by "helicopter parents." We have made this nation too safe. It's tragic to see kids these days with their faces glued to tablets and smart phones. I am deeply grateful that my childhood in the 1960's was closer to Huck Finn's--with long hours spent in nature with friends--than to the kids today.<br/>  We have become a nation of cowards. And now we must hear the republican candidates banging the drums of war! As if anyone of them would fight it themselves. Big talk from little men.

How many discoveries that could truly help mankind and the world are not being discovered, researched, cultivated, developed and made available because of attitudes like Tim Hunt's?<br/><br/>Every day, we see more and more mysteries unraveled by science.  <br/><br/>To all women, young and old, smart and courageous enough to go into science, I say, stay the course, a thump on the head to Tim Hunt and all others like him, and NEVER GIVE UP!

Sexual harassment?? Give the guy a break! He's 72 years old! He's a brilliant biochemist and he's also a little old fashioned because he grew up in an entirely different time, still believes in the "fairer sex" and actually thought he was saying something witty.  He's a product of his times, and thankfully, times are changing. If some guy in his 30s had said it, then I would understand the backlash. Tim Hunt? It's like somebody's grandpa said it.

Hmmm OK what form of transit is already electric powered, does not use oil or fossil fuels, and does not require driving?<br/>Yep, TRAINS and we already have them!<br/>WHY are we investing huge sums of money into self-driving cars when we are<br/>going to have to move towards Green Transit Rail, LightRail Trolleys, buses, shuttles, bicycles and walking??  This is another huge waste of resources and efforts.  Auto Addiction in all forms still kills 30,000 a year, uses 10x the land of Green transit, injures hundreds of thousands, costs huge amounts for free parking, traffic cops, traffic courts, ambulances etc.  The 2nd biggest source of ER accident visits is of course auto accidents after falls.<br/>When I ride on a train I can truly sleep, read, go to the bathroom whenever I want, converse and in the old days which could be revived, even have a nice drink after work or during a trip.<br/>We should be researching how to make Green Transit more efficient and civilized and fun.  In days of old I rode to Hoboken on the train with some other musicians and we had a great time leading the whole train car in sing alongs on the way!<br/>This idea is akin to the electric can opener or the accursed leaf-blower and destined for the dustbin of history!

"To the contrary, first-trimester abortions, which account for nearly nine in 10 of all abortions, are already among the safest of all medical procedures,"<br/><br/>Actually, that is not true at all, is it?  In 100% of the cases a child is killed.  And the NY Times and most of its readers deny the very humanity of those whom they seek to kill.  Sad!

I don't really understand this comment, what about the situation described above makes the partygoers lose their innocence? More importantly, why is that a requirement for us to denounce what you admit was the officer's overreaction?  The teens were invited to a party via Facebook, and as often happens with this type of invitation they arrived en masse. Isn't that the fault of the party ORGANIZER not the partygoer. Were the kids being angelic, no they were breaking some rules. However, it’s worth noting that you are conveniently ignoring the neighbours who were caught on video hurling insults and actually fighting with one of the children. If nothing else these women were clearly escalating the situation.<br/>Regardless, I don't begrudge the neighbours calling the police, that is their right. However, when officers are essentially called in for CROWD CONTROL for a teenage party gone awry, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that the officers will act in a professional manner and will calm the situation down! Three other officers on that video were clearly able to do that, one decided to run around like Rambo cursing, throwing people down, and pulling his weapon. The innocence or lack thereof of the partygoers is immaterial, and your attempt to excuse an officer that you ADMIT was so out of control that he almost shot someone because he was "stressed" is suspect and far from what I would call neutral.

I used to love Jcrew, and still do like a lot of their fashion sensibilities and quirky styling of classic pieces, but my God what happened to the fit in the last couple years?? Everything is so cropped and BOXY, like who on earth can wear this stuff? What normal woman wants her shirt riding up a muffin top with three inches of extra fabric on either side of your midsection? Get some real women in there without 12 inch torso's! Some of us would still buy the higher end clothing. IF it came down past our belly button.

Why does this even matter?<br/><br/>I’m from Hawai’i.  Not counting the military and tourist presence we are all 100% “Hawai’ian.”  That’s an inside joke as the only “pure” Hawai’ans left are on the completely private island west of Kauai’i called Ni’ihau....which is owned by the “white” Johnson family!<br/>Our ancestry can be “part Hawai’an, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Okinawan,  German (a LOT of Germans), French, Mexican, Russian and so on...meaning we are 100% Hawai’ian.  Census takers would like to be able to mark one box.<br/>1) You must have 50% or more Hawai’an ancestry to be on a long list for housing.<br/>2) You need “one drop” of Hawai’ian blood to attend Kamehameha Schools. K-12. a private school with plenty scholarships. and admission is beset by multiple lawsuits as the Princess who made the will said the school was for “the children (keiki) of the Hawai’ian Islands.”  So--does that mean children born and raised on the islands or blood ancestry...who knows?<br/><br/>All I know is that the peoples of Hawai’i are beautiful people.  Hybrid vigor at its best.  And attempting to pigeon hole anyone is ridiculous. <br/><br/>It’s all about class structure, and possessions.  Who gets to own what.  Our mixed ancestry is who we are.  It’s time to move past where your ancestors grew up or what your ancestors owned or didn’t own.  No one I know looks at the color of one’s skin or other physical characteristics.  Time to stop stereotyping and just get on with our lives.  <br/><br/>We are all equal under the sun.

How many crimes of passion/opportunity are committed because of severe physical, mental or emotional stress? Civilians who are under stress and commit crimes are Still Held Responsible for their actions. Because if your stress is that severe, you are supposed to Get Help! It is totally inexcusable the way he handled that young girl. Imagine if that had been your daughter! Yes the teens were in the wrong, yes the cop was stressed, but there is no way that those two equaled the treatment that she received. If another civilian had done that to her, it would have been called assault!

What part of flinging and tossing an unarmed, slender girl down, while waving a gun around, like some tweak from a lousy movie, constitutes "unintentional mistreatment?!" <br/><br/>I'm a White, middle-class college student who's never broken any law, and even though I only have a part-time job, I'm still a tax payer who doesn't want to fund these lunatics, their excuses, and a very sick system that protects them.<br/>We are entitled to police protection, and we'd better find a way to demand it before the next "heroic cop" having a bad day decides to vent his/her frustration on us.

When you don't give respect how do you expect to get respect?   He came out his car like a bull cursing at the kids SO he got back what he gave.  I understand that!  why don't you? He came out of his car acting such a fool that when some kids were trying to return his flash light he drop being the fool he cursed that them?    a person cannot.... not even a cop can yell and scream at someone and expect not to get the same back.

You did excuse the police officer?  The story is about the police officers behavior NOT that of the kids.   Kids are just that KIDS.  Even if I look at the kids actions the police offers response was NOT JUSTIFIED!!!   Until people like you start holding them accountable for their actions it will not change.  What you did in your post is make the kids responsible for the COPS actions.   There were 2 other office in the video?  They didn't act like that.  WHY?  Because there was no need too.  The cop made the situation more then it need be not the kids.   The kids were acting like kids this cop acted like a tyrant!   and yes your post does try and justify that?  smh 

79115
At what point will the depraved absurdity of our paid-for "leaders" become so obvious that our kids simply stop volunteering for military service?  When will their parents raise them to recognize that this has nothing to do with heroic patriotism?  As we used to say, "what if they had a war and nobody came?"  Please, young Americans who admirably want to do heroic things (and their families), look for other avenues to truly serve your country and humankind.  We need you more than the profiteers and coffin-makers do!

What about hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles? Toyota is backing them 100% and the infrastructure is quickly falling into place to support them. There was a great article about them in the NYT a little while ago. The link is below. Once the infrastructure is in place it seems the clear winner! Maybe EV's for city use or hydrogen fuel-cell hybrids, but pure Ev's don't have the quick fueling time of fuel-cell vehicles and they are limited by the weight of their batteries so electric busses, trains, airplanes, etc. aren't feasible while for hydrogen fueled vehicles you can put more cells in and the weight is not an obstacle. They're also quiet so would be great for planes and busses. <br/><br/>The argument against hydrogen fuel is that it is only as clean as the method of its production and electricity is exactly the same. As more renewable energy comes online both hydrogen fuel and electricity will become more carbon neutral.<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/automobiles/hydrogen-fuel-cell-cars-return-for-another-run.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/automobiles/hydrogen-fuel-cell-cars-return-for-another-run.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/automobiles/hydrogen-fuel-cell-cars-re...</a>

The GOP "alternative" plan to the ACA? What a joke! Five years after the ACA was signed into law and the GOP still has NO "alternative" plan to the ACA! (It's no secret that the GOP NEVER had "alternative" plan to the ACA because they never had any interest in universal health care insurance for all Americans!) Who do they think they are fooling. The ACA is the law of the land, it's working better than all the ominous predictions, and it's high time the GOP get over their anti-ACA fever and start working with the President regarding any improvement in this landmark legislation.

What exactly in the "end game?"  What are we trying to accomplish, and how will know we accomplished it?  The answer.....?  We don't know.  So, yes, while I do feel we had an obligation to fix what we certainly messed up, that time is up.   The Iraqis said they didn't need our help, and told us to leave.  That is it, and we should thank them for the out.<br/>At the absolute most, we should support the Kurds in the north, but let Iran deal with this mess.  It might be interesting to see them deal with an insurgency on their border.  It no longer as anything to do with us!

Why resurrect Ehrlich, the biologist who scared the planet on TV?<br/><br/>1) his predictions, like those of the Club of Rome, were apocalyptic.<br/>2) note similarities to IPCC predictions, scenarios, RCPs.<br/>3) Ehrlich's erstwhile acolytes and admirers begrudgingly acknowledge today that he was [inaccurate], but nevertheless attempt to praise him as "more or less correct" (since the population can't grow for ever).<br/>4) The fall-back is essentially, "OK, he was off by several decades - but better safe than sorry. Look, by 2050 or 2100, it will be bedlam!"<br/>5) Notice the same pattern with Climate Catastrophism.<br/>6) Re-read Thomas Malthus' famous treatise on restricting the population of the poor for their own sake.<br/>7) Note similarities between Malthus, Ehrlich, Club of Rome and IPCC: all used simple formulae to extrapolate the future. All predicted a dire future. All had flawed assumptions. And the recommended prescriptions were always worse than the supposed calamity. <br/><br/>But other than that, I can't see any reason to resurrect Ehrlich. <br/><br/>Kurt in Switzerland

Really?  I found out that the harder you work and the more money you make, the more you are penalized...the premiums go up and so do the OOP and deductibles.  It doesn't pay to work for a living...it pays to do absolutely nothing, so that you can pay nothing for your coverage and have nothing to worry about with regard to out of  pocket expenses.  The ACA reeks of inverted work ethic!

The drink is "not quite Brooklyn enough?" LOL. We grew-up drinking Tango, and Arrow or Hirim Walker blackberry/apricot brandy. Heck, we would drink 10W40 if it came out of a refrigerator.<br/><br/>I doubt anyone is worried about a drink having a Brooklyn taste, although we all appreciate the thought!

Because I skipped all of the mentioned, maybe, I have my “Odyssey Years” to look forward to?  I can wander from room to room and if I fall, and wake up on the floor, I can blame it on last night's party that ---------  I can't remember!  Reminds me of a gal that used to show up at my aunt and uncle's for a drink.  One afternoon, she showed up wondering if they knew who she had had for dinner the night before, because whoever it was, she claimed, "they came, ate, and cleaned up the dishes."

SAY WHAT?  After reading David Brooks's jeremiad about the supposed transition of the younger generation from childhood to adulthood, I'm convinced that mandatory national service is desperately needed.  Nowhere in what I read is there the slightest hint that becoming an adult means anything more than a free ride and self-gratification.  Perhaps this reads as curmudgeonly, but that's not my intention.  I grew up in a household of modest means.  So I was never able to go out and buy whatever I wished or to hang out with friends endlessly without any care about money or where it was coming from.  During college, I recall times when I would walk around campus with a dime in my pocket.  Snacks from vending machines or elsewhere were out of the question because I simply lacked the funds, though I got part-time jobs.  The money I earned had to go for textbooks.  Eventually I got a scholarship and student loans, which made my life more comfortable.  My father quit his job working at his profession as a CPA during my senior year of high school and my parents opened a printing shop that offered photocopies.  I helped them launch the business by placing flyers on car windshields and working with clients preparing mailing labels.  I was not paid in cash, but those efforts allowed my parents to pay tuition.  I don't think I missed out on very much socially.  I went to a college where almost everyone had to get part-time jobs to make ends meet.  To youth I say: Hard Work and Elbow Grease!

Why? Because he's one of them! Always was. It was plain to me 8 years ago, and to anybody who bothered to check on this guy. But no, most 'progressives' just saw a skinny black guy saying sweet things and immediately concluded that he was a raging leftist radical, just like the Republican base I might add, which just shows the level at which most voters choose candidates, regardless of party affiliation. Sad.

KLM~ Didn't you know? Religion solves all ills. It truly IS magic!! Our daughter has dual degrees in English and Journalism, graduated Magna Cum Laude, plus has a degree in accounting. She works in a gravel pit weighing trucks and has just started keeping the company's books. All for $14/hr. She now lives at home since divorcing her emotionally abusive, controlling husband and is hoping to get her own place when her college loans are paid. She is also religious but apparently the "magic" only works for some.<br/>Our 30 year old son lives with his in-laws in a back bedroom of their rented apartment. He can't afford an apartment of his own, even on $20/hr. His company provided health insurance is over $800 a month. Not Cadillac, just mediocre but costs him a full before taxes week's pay. How does one get ahead against such overwhelming expenses?<br/>My husband, who never attended college but is extremely bright, was able to support a wife and 5 children on one pay working as a non-union service technician. We bought a beautiful home on one pay and I never worked until our youngest was in 7th grade and then this was only part time at minimum wage. How many can do this today on a blue collar job? And we're agnostics!!<br/>Our  married daughter is still as poor as she was when she was single. So much for marriage, according to Mr. Brooks, lifting one out of poverty. Simpleton solutions for complex problems. That describes the mindset of the right wing to a T.

Did the students want to be there or were they forced by their parents' to attend college? This seems to have a great impact on a student's performance.<br/>Two of our children chose to attend college on their own, without being forced into it. One graduated from a 4 year state university Magna Cum Laude with a 3.96 GPA, 1 of only 5 in her year. The second, who is still in college, has a GPA of 3.86. And surprisingly, the world does not "revolve" around them. Not all young adults are spoiled, self centered brats, no matter how hard one wishes it to be so!

Is Whole Foods really planning to use a program of deceptive labeling to raise profits?  Apparently they think they can pull the wool over their educated customers eyes.  If I wanted to buy conventionally grown produce, I don't need to spend extra and play guessing games at Whole Foods.  Way to destroy what sets you apart!  

81195
Why not use separate ratings systems for organic and conventional?  Using one rating system for both doesn't make any sense and separating them would alleviate the very sound concerns of the organic farmers.<br/><br/>A long-standing complaint of mine with Whole Foods is that they intermingle the organic and conventional produce.  I waste a lot of time hunting and pecking around to find the organic.  Example:  there may be avocados in 4 different locations.  The first three I suss out are conventional, do they even have organic ava's today?  How long am I expected to search to find out, especially in that our WF's is always (always!) mobbed, and it is physically difficult to even navigate the aisles of the too small produce section (excuse me, sorry, sorry, excuse me ...).

Hillary keep us from perpetual war in the Middle East?!? LOL Are we talking about the same woman? Hillary who voted for going to war in the Middle East based on the same Intel that W had?  The same Hillary who contributed to further destabilization of the Middle East through her actions as S.O.S.?<br/><br/>Keep us from polluting the earth? Isn't this the woman who primarily flies in private jets?  This 1 percenter who insists on $50k speaking fees even when speaking at colleges?<br/><br/>Wake up.

Oh please - really ??<br/>Do you know the past history of these officers especially the shooter? Found unfit emotionally to be an officer by a suburban town's<br/>police force - YET hired by the Cleveland police department who never looked into his recent past history of being denied a position as a law enforcement officer by trainers and supervisors/command of the suburban police department.<br/>And then we are surprised at the video and what transpired in about 2 seconds ?!

Isn't this the same argument President Jackson made when he dissolved the central bank in the 1830's? The economy collapsed! <br/><br/>No, federal banks play a key role, as shown during Paul Volker's tenure, in controlling inflation. It is left to us to demand legislation that controls the large banks. Stability is achieved by forcing out cash stuck in shadow banks, hidden by the rich, into the financial system and using these resources wisely to improve technology, infrastructure, education, take on risky new ventures, etc. Stability, in short is lots of money circulating: you need central banks to regulate circulation.

Was he "Republican" when he pushed the Obamacare monstrosity? Was it "Republican" to support gay marriage? How about playing footsie with Iran?  How about warning our enemies about pulling out troops in Iraq, leading to this mess with Isis? This president simply is problematic and does not really have a knack for doing the right thing for America - or to the point, he consistently harms America - an attribute generally not considered the best thing for an American president....I assume you voted for him!

Have you noticed?  Not a word about whether it tastes good!  The last time I ate an egg that tasted good was in Hendaye, France, in 2009.  The eggs were sold in a butcher's shop, stacked in the corner.  When you eat an egg that tastes good, you remember it.  The tomatoes from my garden taste good.  That is why I grow them.  I do not grow tomatoes because it is virtuous to do so, I grow tomatoes because you cannot buy one that tastes good.  Some of Sunset's Mexican offerings are sometimes tolerable.  So all this chirping about organic good not-organic bad is merely concealing the horror that most people have never eaten food that tasted good, and therefore don't miss what they have never experienced.  And if they did taste it, they probably wouldn't like it.  Like that group of scouts that went on a trip to Morocco some years ago and were fed French baguettes.  They rebelled and demanded good old Wonder Bread.  There you go.

81714
What is bias and what is recognition of an unpopular truth? It seems to have become illegal to suggest that women are different from men, but they are, and denial of that basic truth has fostered a bizarre sense of entitlement.<br/><br/>For months I had to stare out my window at a larger-than-life-sized poster promoting the TV series Rizzoli &amp; Isles. It depicted the two ladies in full make-up and eveningwear with captions something like "I saw five dead bodies this morning" and " I got punched in the gut today."<br/><br/>Apparently we have collectively hypnotized ourselves into believing that women can now spend all the time and energy it takes to look glamorous, clack down the streets in high heels, talk at each other without listening while texting on their cell phones, and solve crimes.<br/><br/>How dare anyone suggest that women might tend to behave differently from men in any situation! Except of course if they do it better...

@ Paulis<br/><br/>Maybe we were just more accepting that this was our lot? We didn't have higher expectations? I know I was thankful to get the cast-off towels with holes and my childhood bed and furniture for my first apartment. My parents sure weren't taking me on a shopping trip to Bed, Bath and Beyond to outfit my new digs!

Who was it who drove the police car to within a few feet of this child? It was the police. Normally they would have stayed on the road, across the street, and remained behind their car to shout "Drop the Gun!" several times before shooting anyone, much less a child.<br/><br/>The cops' actions sicken me. A dead child. How can Cleveland let this continued to go unaddressed? He wasn't even given a chance to hear and process an order and comply with it before he was shot down.<br/><br/>I even heard the excuse that it looked like a real gun. What are they supposed to look like, sandwiches?<br/><br/>It's as if Cleveland has no heart. Do you have a heart, Cleveland?

Yeah, do as clueless Romney suggested: If you fall on "hard time" like he and his wife di while attending college just sell some of your stocks!

Why not Whole Foods become more transparent about their foods? For example, non-subjective ratings such as - "grown without pesticides, fungicides and herbicides". In addition, there are many other chemicals that growers use on produce that are not easily classified as pesticides, fungicides or fertilizers. For examples chemicals to delay or speed up fruit ripening, chemicals to prevent sprouting, darkening, or drying, chemicals to improve the appearance (dyes), and many other! This is why Certified Organic is reassuring. If Whole Foods is honest, they should list every chemical that was used on a conventional produce.

Young college graduates without jobs?  According to the research David chose to report: They're lazy in school, go live with their parents, are pessimistic about the country but not about themselves...  No wonder they don't have jobs.  Who would hire this generation!  <br/><br/>Sigh!  More blaming the victim and absolving the adult generation from responsibility and accountability. Blaming the victim is a big conservative talking point to make sure the wealthy power elite is not held accountable and we do not solve any social problems requiring taxes in this country. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of fundamental principles from psychology and the social sciences to consider about how adulthood happens: <br/><br/>1.  Human development occurs within a specific socioeconomic context, and that context strongly influences how human development transpires. And the context for today's young people is ________?<br/><br/>2.  In every society, it is the job of the adult generation to guide and prepare the way for the younger generation to become productive adults. What letter grade would you give to today's power elite, corporations, and major employers in terms of how well they have met their responsibilities to our younger generation?<br/><br/>Sorry kids!  It's the Hunger Games--may the odds be in your favor.

Strauss-Kahn didn't know that some or all of the women at these sex "parties" were prostitutes?<br/><br/>That's like saying he couldn't be sure of whether or not the sun rose in the east if he wasn't up at dawn to see it.<br/><br/>As New Yorkers like to say, "Oh puhleeze!"

And what do all our outraged defenders of equality say about the woman who helped the two convicts tunnel their way out of the NY prison?  Or of the women guards who turned the Baltimore prison and even their own bodies over to the head convict?  Clearly there is an emotional vulnerability here which clever men are able to make use of.  Just getting a PhD in science does not change the rules of the game.  As the French advised us when confronted with life's puzzles, Cherchez la femme!

Use Twitter to propagate news? Ha! For a couple of years<br/>I've been posting to my Twitter account (@cvpacker) to try to<br/>generate some interest in a secret construction project that's<br/>been going on here in Washington, to no avail. <br/><br/>In principle, though, I believe in Twitter.

Could you discuss----what are ratios of CEO to average worker pay in other advanced countries vs in US? <br/><br/>In your talk with Solow at the Cuny Grad Center, you cited very briefly that Germany manufactures and exports quality products and has good labor/management relations. Why do they allow union  reps on the boards of big companies? Why don’t they find it necessary for profits to destroy unions or at least weaken them, like the US does? <br/><br/>Suppose a big employer imports foreign workers from low wage countries and has US workers train them, or else no severance pay. Such a deal! Please discuss---the Disney tech employees salaries were 100,000, and their replacements—60,000. But Disney was profitable. Some of the laid off Disney workers might have still been paying their college tuition loans!  <br/><br/>Congress increasing h1b visas, per corporate lobbying, has been going on for decades. Could you discuss effect on US wages? <br/><br/>Does Germany, with it’s good mgmt/union relations do the Disney thing to it’s citizens? Why not? What countries are comparable to US in importing foreign educated workers and laying off qualified, productive workers in their own country? So fascinating. Any discussion would be most interesting.

I'm not sure I agree with the concept of choosing what you want to do, especially when it follows a period in your life when you are told, repeatedly, by others what to do?  When I was young, people would ask what I wanted to do, but, I think I might have benefitted from being told.  I ended up taking life as it came, making myself useful where possible --- grew up with saying, "make yourself useful as well as ornamental."  I never found myself without anything to do -- it didn't make me rich, but I was never hungry, either.   Maybe, we make it all too hard on the kids, as we are the ones that set up this nonsense of what they need to be --- just be useful!

Please explain how gerrymandered districts effect statewide or national elections?  They don't.  <br/><br/>The left was fine with gerrymandered districts when it was they who drew them.  That the other side should put in place the same-disaster!<br/><br/>No mention of the left's own political heavyweights like Soros, Jon Stryker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, every union, the trial lawyers and on and on.  The Koch's want us to follow the Constitution-HORROR!  I would think our Constitutional Scholar president would be fine with that rather than "transforming" our nation.

Outliers? Really? Blue Cross and Humana are outliers? CareFirst Blue Cross in Maryland has an 80% share of the Obamacare market, and they're asking for a 26.7% rate increase. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee has a 70% share of the Obamacare market, and they're asking for a 36.3% rate increase. In Iowa, Wellmark Blue Cross is asking for a 43% increase. CoOpportunity Health used to have the lion's share of the Iowa market, but they went broke last year and were taken over by the state's insurance commissioner.<br/><br/>And these are only the larger increases. Many more are asking for double digit increases. Yes, insurance commissioners in each state can refuse the rate increases. The companies can also pull out of the exchange marketplace, as so many have already done.<br/><br/>C'mon, Paul! I thought you were a Nobel Prize winning economist. Didn't you learn anything about actuarial science? The actuaries have been saying from the beginning that the risk pool has to consist of at least 40% low risk customers in order to be sustainable. So far, the average has been about 27%. They predicted that this sort of risk distribution would lead to the so-called death spiral with ever increasing rates leading to dropping enrollments. The CBO originally forecast enrollment for 2015 to be 13 million. It came in at just over 10 million. These rate increases are going to make the 2016 enrollment numbers even worse. The death spiral has already begun.

Thank you George Bush?!  Wasn't it Obama that winked at the negotiators and told them to wait until he was re-elected and then he would do Russia's bidding?  Hasn't he been doing Putin's bidding all along?  I believe Obama is disappointed that Putin and he don't get together as friends for all the world to see, but then Putin has no desire to meet with Obama or do anything for humanity or the globe.  He's focused on a new communist Russia, and perhaps a re-establishment of the USSR.  <br/><br/>But seriously, you are blaming Bush?!

Why does it have to be one or the other? Can't Baltimore police patrol crime-ridden areas without treating the inhabitants like animals? <br/><br/>Some will surely portray this as a "see, we told you!" moment, but the reality is that the fault of this lays at the feet of the police department. There are towns and cities throughout the United States where police treat black people with dignity, while simultaneously enforcing the law and keeping violent crime low. If Newark can lower the murder rate without an uptick in police violence against young black men, surely Baltimore can do the same. <br/><br/>I would further point to New York City after the federal courts put a stop to search-and-frisk; no crime wave. NYPD continued to patrol (although I'm sure there were and are continued abuses), but poor black and hispanic neighborhoods didn't go up in flames. <br/><br/>The solution here is simple: train Baltimore cops to not harass people, have more foot patrols, and increase the number of drug treatment programs. Relations between West Baltimore residents and the police will heal, people will trust each other, and crime will go down.

How is it even legal for Disney to fire all its American IT workers in order to hire H1B workers?  The alleged rationale for H1B visas is that there are technically qualified Americans to do the H1B jobs.  Obviously  in this case the American IT workers are MORE qualified as they have been doing the job for years and obviously have experience in actually running Disney's IT...<br/>Like so much other Corporate welfare the H1B visa program is a scam which has been destroying IT and other professional jobs for middle class Americans for years...<br/>The Disney example shows just how ludicrous it is!<br/>Boycott Disney!

Men's soccer is and will always be "dominant"? Women's soccer has never been given a chance! Of course the sport that gets all the marketing dollars and airtime will be the more popular choice.  Playing on astroturf (Really?!?), pathetic funding (maybe 1% of men's even tho viewership is not THAT much lower), male only FIFA board, and the over-sexualization of women (US team's owner requested to be called "Daddy" for crying out loud!).  These women are being straight up discriminated against. <br/><br/>The US women's team is amazing - better than the men's. Women want to watch other women play soccer - we are 50% of the population.  Plenty of men want to watch women play soccer.  Your opinion is not "fact".

Really Curtis?  You think girls are having babies to get welfare?  And then spend the rest of their lives in poverty?  Sounds like a plan.

Porter:<br/><br/>Greece is a poster child for the failure of conservative austerity policies? Or crony socialism?<br/><br/>What did conservative austerity have to do with the following Greek policies reported by Suzanne Daley in the NYT back in 2010? “'Greece is the last Soviet-style economy in Europe,' said Yannis Stournaras, an economist .... 'Other countries have some closed professions. But nothing like Greece.'” <br/><br/>"For selling a cancer drug for $4,200, Mr. Stournaras said, a pharmacist makes a profit of around $1,400. 'That’s a movement of the elbow that is more expensive than one of Roger Federer’s.'”<br/><br/>"Experts say there are about 70 closed professions here, including those of lawyers, engineers, taxi drivers, speech therapists, welders, notaries, street market vendors, newsstand operators and architects. Each is protected from competition by a byzantine tangle of regulations and licensing requirements that result in high prices for consumers and a reliable living for insiders."<br/><br/>"No use shopping around for a less expensive lawyer or notary, for instance. They all charge fixed fees, as do many other professions....  [T]he the number of long-haul trucking licenses, which has been frozen for 25 years."<br/><br/>"A study carried out ... 2006 estimated that opening these professions would increase gross domestic product by about $35 billion, or 10 percent, in five years."<br/><br/>$35 billion! -- that would go a long way to helping Greece's truly needy as the Greeks start to clean up their economy.

What is the issue here? Can't any human compare themselves to another human that they admire? Another frivolous piece of writing about Women's World Cup from the Times.

Actually, if truth be told, all professional male players should watch women to learn how to 1) fight for a ball without diving; and 2) learn some grit - if you need to fake an injury and roll around on the ground looking for a call, go warm the pine!

A disinformation campaign by Obamacare's OPPONENTS? <br/><br/>LOL. Look who is talking! From day 1, bereft of all but the flimsiest evidence, Paul Krugman has been trying to talk up Obamacare. If Krugman sees disinformation campaigns everywhere, it is in large part because he is seeing his own reflection.<br/><br/>True, last year approved increases were smaller than requests, but as Robert Laszewski points out, (1) unlike last year, the carriers now have hard data to show the insurance regulators, and (2) a 35% increase is not suddenly going to become a 5% increase. <br/><br/>The point is not that Obamacare has failed, but that Paul Krugman jumped the gun when he instantly pronounced it a success; and he did that because he chose to use his bully pulpit at the NYT to try to spin the debate over Obamacare. With Krugman, politics always trumps economics.

 "Do you think the police live in these neighborhoods? Obviously not."  And that is a great part of the problem. In many communities throughout the United States police who live in the communities that they work and patrol, those officers take their cruisers home at night and weekends.  It creates a police presence. It assures the residents that one of their own is there and on duty. I know. One of those police lived next door to me and she often parked her cruiser in the driveway.  We loved it.  Criminals never knew if the officer was there on duty, responding to a call or just about to come out the front door! It worked. By the way it was a community of modest means and mixed races.<br/>Baltimore could do the same. Yes, some housing would have to be seriously upgraded and money would have to be spent.  But imagine the possibilities. I don't know how large West Baltimore is but lets say that about 45 homes are upgraded and volunteers are sought to live and work in the community. Its a great opportunity to rebuild trust on both sides and deter crime as well.  I hope that Baltimore is willing to give it a try.

Are you kidding? Have you read the agreement? No? - that's because almost no one has!!!  Organized labor IS the way to go if you enjoy not being a slave at the mercy of the richer and more powerful organizations that offer employment; if you enjoy having some ability to be sick or take a day off without losing your job and becoming homeless; if you want safety protections so you don't get injured by dangerous or ill-maintained equipment at work, etc. Europe has a social safety net so that even the least fortunate members of their society are not destitute and subsidize the uberpowerful. Their companies are held to higher standards in how they treat employees...ie "people". I'm a person and so I support labor rules that protect myself and those I care about...ie society.

Only cute, smiling scientists.<br/><br/>NASA probably holds a daily collective prayer that some cosmic object whacks their own satellite for good out of the sky.<br/><br/>At least, after that first glitch, their climate scientists remembered the Climate 101 first lesson.<br/><br/>That the most important thing in modern climate science is to suppress satellite data. And ignore it, like Tom Peterson.<br/><br/>Congress votes now on cutting the funds of NASA-Earth (not NASA-Space, but the fellows who change all historic temps data every month) by 40%, for starters.

Why not bring this whole article to its logical conclusion? If you have to take on enormous debt to go to college, maybe you just shouldn't go to college. In fact, it would make more sense if all high school graduates would just boycott college--at least until universities start lowering their tuition rates. That's right. Put some pressure on the demand side of the equation. For $50,000 or $100,000, you could start a business. It might not be a big business, but you could probably start a coffee shop or bodega. Or maybe build your own iPhone app. Forget college. Forget taking out loans that just make bankers richer. Just don't go to college at all!

What does affordable housing have to do with "Whites Only"? Is it possible that the NY Times is unaware that there are twice as many white people in the US living below the poverty line than black people? Trying to prevent a huge housing development from destroying your quiet village is now racist?<br/><br/>I'd love to live on the beach in Carmel, or Malibu, but guess what? I don't have $10M for a house. So I have resigned myself to visiting. It never occurred to me that the residents of these towns had an obligation to buy me a house!<br/><br/>But of course, it wouldn't be me who would get the house; after all, I'm in the middle class. We're the people who pay for everything, and get nothing in return, so its only natural that we should help subsidize a house for someone else to live someplace we'll never be able to afford.

If someone is carrying such that you can see it, you have more information than if it were concealed, correct? So, if you are so disturbed at the sight of a gun, then turn around or otherwise put distance between you and your "attacker." Quick!

Isn't it obvious by now?  If history is correct successful Republican presidential candidates always target some group they feel is the source of the nation's woes.  Since the Supreme Court is likely to vote in favor of legalizing Gay marriage nationwide Republicans and Conservatives can't scare the  voters by uttering the word 'Gay' anymore.  So now it's time for the Republicans to pick a new scapegoat in time for the 2016 election.  The public sector unions seem tailor made as the new group Republicans love to hate.  Their tatic will be to portray the public sector union workers as leeches who are bleeding the poor hard pressed taxpayers dry with their lavish pensions and all sorts of mindboggling perks like healthcare and paid vacations!!!  Well we can't have that now can we???  Why should that mean guy who yells NEXT at the DMV have a cornucopia of benefits that the poor private sector  employees don't have ??  It's the classic Republican strategy  -- the good guys (the private sector employees) vs the bad guys (public sector union employees),  Republicans just love to pit people against each other.  That's the American way.

Can you imagine the frustration and utter disconnect that would result if this plan went through?<br/>Our government recognizes the ethnic and economic disparities in our nation, but rather than do something constructive -- better education, more jobs, raising the minimum wage -- it throws this population into a community where they cannot possibly integrate and where their chances of advancement are seriously curtailed.<br/>Where do they find work?  Commute into Manhattan every day?  Or do they become maids and chauffeurs to the "privileged" class?<br/><br/>Doesn't anyone realize that this is not democracy?  It is American-style Communism!

Who's in charge there? Who's supervising these cops who are "stepping back"? Fire them! <br/><br/>The idea that the officers decide when they will work, while continuing to "come to work" and, unsaid, by the union, take a paycheck is outrageous. Black communities aren't saying they don't want police. They're saying they don't want illegal policing that can lead to the murder of their loved ones. Everyone understands that. <br/><br/>They're pretending otherwise to show their contempt for these communities and to show their dissatisfaction with being criticized. They need to grow up and do their job, like the rest of us. <br/><br/>How many readers are "stepping back" at work, refusing to do what they're paid for, and still have jobs?

You say it outrages police?  That seems hardly the case in southern Oregon.  County sheriffs in this part of the state are quick to defend open carry, the gun carriers' 2nd amendment "rights" trump the rights of ordinary citizens to feel safe in public.

May she be as black as she can possibly be!!!! Scorn upon her parents and those who would criticize her because you can be sure their contribution to the black community will not be as great.

And, what would the US casualties have been?  There is nothing over there which is worth one American life.<br/><br/>We don't "have to take back city (Mosul) in urban warfare," nor any other place over there.  Let the locals do the heavy lifting, it is their neighborhood after all.  If they don't care, why on earth should we?  Part of the reason they don't fight is they don't feel a need to, since the Americans always seem to come in and do the dirty work for them.  Enough!

Why not?  We live in an upside down world.<br/>Why do these programs still exist, helping one and excluding another?  I bet there are many small businesses who would benefit from an SBA loan!<br/>Favoring one group is discriminatory.

No Russian aggression? You just took over part of Ukraine! And your claim that the US readily lies to its own people is beyond laughable, given your own nation's diet of state-provided propaganda. <br/><br/>This is happening because Russia invaded Ukraine. We, and the European Union, haven't invaded. Russia did. Do you really think the world wants another cold war? Your idiot leader Putin has given us no choice.

92159
Does anyone really think that the Russians are going to invade Eastern Europe? Of course not! This is a classic case of boosting your sagging economy via the military-industrial complex. A side benefit is fear-mongering that forces our allies to circle their wagons - around us, yay! Hopefully, things won't get out of hand and we will just be fighting proxy wars, like the one in Ukraine.

Slow sports day, eh?<br/><br/>Mostly men posters getting their knockers in knot because an NYT blogger has the audacity to bring up the fact that some women footballers are compared to certain notable men footbalers.<br/>Mon dieu! Really!<br/>Okay, what could be so objectionable?<br/><br/>I am fine with this and what I find interesting and commendable is that nobody compares a woman footballer to Cronaldo. That woud be scary, eh?

You mean the king has no clothes? The Lame Duck President? Mr. Interception leader of the Choom gang? Where are his college transcripts? Mr. Transparency? He reads so well!  Mr. You didn't build that. Fundamentally transform this country.<br/>Not once has he ever spoken on how great this country is, not once has any of his speeches inspired but to ridicule and condemn and blame. Has threatened the supreme court.<br/>8 years of Marxism. I thought this country had enough of Carter but we seem to forget our past and decided to take another change on "CHANGE".<br/><br/>We haven't even talked about the IRS scandal for which Nixon was impeached on far lesser infractions.<br/><br/>The Fast and Furious operation which blew up in their faces<br/><br/>Benghazi where and inept sec of state and an absent President allowed several Americans to be killed without even trying to send in some sort of support.<br/><br/>Flickering Greatness has only exposed his dim view on this politics and has shone a bright beacon of what America needs less of.

Carefully edited video?  You are out on a thin branch on that assertion.  What I don't get is all the police apologists who will find any reason to excuse abuse of force.  I wonder how any of you would feel in a similar circumstance of excessive force for a minor infraction.  Death for selling cigarettes?  What a democracy you uphold!

Did anyone really think that the Russians were going to invade Ukraine? Of course not! Until they actually did.<br/><br/>If I were Lavtian, Lithuanian, or Estonian, I would be justifiably concerned about Russian aggression in other parts of the world--up to and including it's designs on my country's territorial sovereignty, and its attempts to exert influence on my government's internal affairs. In fact, I would be deeply suspicious about the prospect of an alleged "pro-Russian separatist movement" suddenly appearing out of the blue in my country, prompting a similar "Russian rescue" to "liberate" my oppressed nation of its autonomy and self-determination.<br/><br/>You can argue that the U.S. has no compelling interests in Eastern Europe if you like--but as a NATO member the American government still has treaty obligations it is required to live up to and including supporting NATO member states that request military assistance. If the American people decide that those obligations make NATO more of a liability than an asset, that's a separate issue, and a valid topic for discussion. But unless the U.S. government formally withdraws from the treaty, deployments like these are par for the course--and rightly so.

The phrase "damning by faint praise" comes to mind, don't it? Don't worry, Bernie, the article gushes, you can win an award, just like a Broadway musical! Puh-leeze. Political articles don't have to be all grim and sober, but comparing Sanders ' run for the White House to a musical's run for a a Tony is like -- well, it's like saying that Hillary Clinton's campaign is like watching a cement-drying competition: it'll take a long time, and when it's done we'll have another gray edifice.

As someone who served as a Marine in Iraq during 2003 and supported operations there from in the rear with the gear 2008-2012, can I offer one view?<br/><br/>When will all these pencil necked pundits (Maureen excluded), politicians, public talking-heads and Chicken Hawks of the Right, and Humanitarian Interventionists of the Left stop appropriating and using military terms?<br/><br/>We are not "boots on the ground", we are soldiers and Marines.  <br/><br/>We do not "go into harm's way".<br/><br/>We go into combat and out on combat operations. It's called war, not the quaint harm's way (great John Wayne movie, but not reality).<br/><br/>Soldiers and Marines and SEALS sent to train Iraqis are not "advisers" or "trainers", we are combat forces, we are soldiers and Marines.  <br/><br/>We are not working like DeVry University teachers or Harvard dons, we are in a place trying to make it harder  for ISIS to kill Iraqis and serve as targets from 360 degrees all the time.  Trainers, advisers, please!?<br/><br/>These terms should not ever be used as they are so freely by pols and pundits or the public; we who serve can use them as needed.  But the problem here is that both Republicans, Democrats, Congress and the Executive Branch, and much of the media are being intellectually dishonest.<br/><br/>They are using tough-guy terms for things that are in fact very basic, and they distract from what we are doing and deceive the public.<br/><br/>If you send men and women to WAR, that is not a police-action or hum-int, or training it is combat, and people die.

Too much choice? Consuming people like commodities? Walter Benjamin has a staggering essay on escaping the contingency of choice, which seems to suggest that in order to find a marriage partner you should grow up in the company of your future spouse, jump off a boat when they become engaged to someone else, and then pray that the first dry clothes you find when you come to land just happen to be wedding attire! Um, so much for the saving grace of necessity over choice.<br/><br/>I've been online dating for just over five years. I've met over a hundred, if not hundreds, of women. For me the most salient point from this article is that online dating is really just a way to meet people. I've had one longer relationship with someone I met online, but mostly I've found a few cool women in far flung places to read things like Benjamin with (discussed via Skype!). It might not be true love, or even a boat, and I'm not even sure it was worth all the effort and frustration. But, we'll see-- I just shelved my dating apps last week, and that's how I have the presence of mind to write this comment!

Appeasement, who arms these faction in this imaginary global conflict? The US! Who armed Russia and China, the US! Who armed the Islamic militants? The US! War is our game and death is our policy, so appeasement? A very hollow term once you turn the beast over.

Oh, boy, who thought this move would deter Russia?! What I see is the escalation of the Ukraine war in the next 2-4 weeks. Putin will bring his Army in a short order, because Putin will not "lose face" in face of such "aggression". Now US and NATO gave him an excuse to do what he really wanted to do from the get-go: invade Eastern Ukraine, and annex it to Russia.<br/>So, when Putin does this, what is US/NATO going to do? Go to war with Russia?! Puhleeze. I think they are going to scuttle back, and hope for the best, and the Dictator Putin will have even higher approval rating.<br/>Sheesh! Don't they have anyone thinking in the Pentagon/NATO anymore???!!!

Women, on their own, don't get to make life and death decisions for others?  How unfair!<br/><br/>I am certainly conflicted about abortion, so I cannot take a firm position on the act itself, but the hypocrisy of the pro-abortion folks is irritating.  Pro abortion folks see the abortion as solely the choice of the pregnant woman, which is a clear (if in my view flawed) view of the fetus/unborn child.  <br/><br/>But these same pro-abortion folks take a quite different tack when it comes to supporting the child they decide to have -- in that case the father (or the state), neither of which has any rights regarding the decision to have or not to have the child, must pay for the woman to have and raise the child.  Only women have legal rights; only men have legal responsibilities.  Doesn't that seem a tad hypocritical to even the pro-abortion folks?

95937
Why on a page about misophonia, where these sounds annoy and anger people, have they placed a video with exactly these sounds that plays automatically?! Seriously?? I mean, why would they do that? What is the point? We know what those sounds are. Other people know what the sounds are. The only thing that video serves to do is anger and annoy those of use who have this problem. Take that video off of the page! Or at the very least, let us choose if we want to listen to it rather than bombard us with the sound while we are unsuspectingly attempting to read the article.

What is to explore? The climate change is affecting all of us but the effect on the poor is exponential. I hope that once the "exploring" comes to a conclusion, it is followed by a scientific statement response that will erase any doubt from the faithful community. Otherwise, the only "exploring" we will be doing is in another galaxy!

And are people happier today? No.<br/><br/>Extreme levels of choice do not lead to happiness, as we think they will. We THINK if we have unlimited choice, we will find that rare, rare gem that otherwise we would never have seen.<br/><br/>What really happens is we get blindsided by all the different sparkly choices we could have. Whatever we choose, we are obsessed with what we did not choose -- or what might have come down the pike the next day! or the one after that!<br/><br/>Even worse, it makes us reluctant to "settle", because after all, Prince Charming or George Clooney might be in the next batch.<br/><br/>Often when overwhelmed by choice, people's default is ... to choose nothing. They are just frazzled, and can't pick ANYTHING.<br/><br/>There is a sweet spot between almost no choice -- the village girl who has exactly two village boys to choose from -- and the 21st century urbanite who has 10,000 choices on Tinder. Unfortunately nobody seems to know where that sweet spot is.

Could you tell me waht is a difference between Warsaw plus Riga and Berlin plus Paris? As far as I konow, all this capital cities are part of the NATO!

Thank you in advance for your reply.<br/><br/>J.I.<br/><br/>P.S. Again, Poland, Czech and the Baltics are no longer part of "Russian backyard." The are full members of the West now!

Russia "attacking civilian ships in the Baltic"? You mean Russian Military exercising in international air space and open sea - thank goodness that the USA or NATO never does anything like that.<br/>Is this a slippery slope?<br/>Next thing you know they will be using assassination, torture, indefinite imprisonment without trial and Orwellian levels of spying on their citizens while claiming that national security warrants such measures.<br/>Or even worse the police apparatus will be armed with war fighting weapons and occupy the country.<br/>Oh these Russians are such shameless hypocrites!

Why are societies breaking down?  Because there are today at a minimum 800 million food-and-water deprived people in the world -- for a multitude of reasons, including wars.  That is more deprived people that at any other moment in human history.   We celebrate the prosperity of two billion so that we can encourage four billion with messages of consumption and ignore the approximately one billion who "find the water safer than the land."  The world never had two billion with such incredible prosperity.  Hurrah for the blindness that made it all possible!  The solution:   All the world's military budgets need to be put into one pot and applied to the collective problems facing man.  That was the whole point of united efforts following the two world wars.  Do we need a third to reawaken the effort?

" People call African American names they did during slavery " And how does Nasir feel? Angry! And what does he do when he is angry? Sit down and wait until it goes away. What a sad commentary of our society. The young, innocent boy is instigated to be angry because he is insulted, demeaned, uncaring of his sensibilities, an outsider. Anger would be the natural response of every human being. But what does Nasir do? Sit down until anger passes. What a heavy burden for a little boy to carry! Not only has he to suffer insult and indignity but his natural anger has to be forcefully, willfully curbed. And fearing retribution for his natural response he has found an unnatural coping mechanism. It is so heartbreaking. Which explains why African-Americans have a higher incidence of hypertension, heart and kidney problems. Coping with lifelong slights and bigotry will manifest in unhealthy ways. And it does'nt stop even when you become The President of the U.S.A.!!

What's your problem?  Stop whining.<br/><br/>• I am 33 and free of medical issues. But because my partner and I are not legally married – six weeks pregnant with a 5-month-old baby at home [and using no contraceptive or having unprotected sex?].<br/><br/>• I felt some relief knowing that I had a clear ticket out.<br/>You wanted to shirk YOUR responsibility for YOUR pregnancy, whether deliberate or due to carelessness.<br/><br/>• Still, I balked at the realization that I had to request permission. (?)<br/>• I had no control, no privacy and no anonymity over this intimate, difficult matter pertaining strictly to my own body. The idea that anyone but me had the power to decide my family’s fate and mine was harrowing.<br/><br/>You did, as much as with your gynecologist; like you had the "choice" to become pregnant. You went before a panel of two doctors and a social worker, not reality TV. Were you 'outed' by the panel?<br/><br/>• the law does not recognize a woman’s right to make her own choice?<br/>It does.<br/>• 98% of abortion requests are approved.<br/>Seems like an innocuous bureaucratic procedure, a public health measure.<br/><br/>Come to America. Subject yourself to the "Choice" wars. Go back home and be thankful that "religious fundamentalists in Israel aren’t particularly vocal on the issue"; that "Jewish law actually permits abortion...because a fetus is not considered an autonomous entity"; that "Israel’s leaders do not have to contend with radical anti-abortion groups the way the American government does."<br/><br/>Count your blessings!

@ John — “What kind of •investigation•”?! Is U.S. Soccer the chief law-enforcement authority in the State of Washington? Just imagine the bellows of outrage from observers, such as yourself, had the federation charged into this matter, interviewing witnesses, and arguably stepping on the toes of •official• investigations. Private entities such as U.S. Soccer have an obligation to seek information in such instances, but they also have to know their place. The federation has •no• expertise in law enforcement matters, and everyone is far better off if they don’t pretend they do.<br/><br/>— Brian

Here's a unique idea:  Why not allow European countries to handle perceived threats to their interests?  Do they not have the money?  Do they not have the political will?  Do they not perceive a sufficient threat? Are they waiting for Uncle Sam to predictably pony up yet more treasure and blood because that is the knee-jerk reaction of a political system so thoroughly corrupted by the influence of military/corporate interests? BINGO!  There it is.

Do we need anymore proof that organized religion is the worst thing to happen to women since the Partnership Society, in which women and men shared power, disappeared around 2300 BC when the bronze age allowed men to create weapons and start domination over society through fear?  Keep organized religion out of politics and in places of worship and homes where it belongs.  Women and men who love them, and were nurtured in their mother's womb, must stop this attempt to suppress the rights of over one-half the world's population - women.  NOW!

  Ms Macur, what game were you watching?  Abby didn't look dangerous, she looked tired and cumbersome... missing a couple of attempts at heading the ball, and the one she did hit, was way off base.<br/>  You are right that this US team will not win this tourney, unless they catch a lot of lucky breaks.  As to the teams you mentioned, Germany and France have shown vulnerabilities ... as to Brazil, why do you think so highly of them?<br/>   This US group is as talented as any other, they just are not as good of a team, as some others.  They need to find a way to win and control the midfield (geez, why is it so hard to make simple passes?.. keep the ball?), and more than anything learn how to finish!

I'm an actor who often asks "What good has my work done for anyone?"   I love doing it, but is it just selfish play?  I've experienced the audience's appreciation in laughter, tears, applause, and gasps, an evenings intervention, a few hours of relief for a ticket, nice but so what?  This story makes the stories I and my fellow actors tell have meaning and value, perhaps even to change lives.  Art what a concept!

Might the views of a retired Major General who twice-received the MOH and spent 30 years in the USMC matter?<br/>General Smedley Butler's impassioned views are easy to read in a pamphlet that is readily available on line -- just search for "War is a Racket." He expresses tremendous respect for soldiers, families, and veterans.<br/><br/>Another USMC Major General, Sam Griffiths, was the first person to translate Sun-Tzu's "The Art of War" into American English. He made the translation in retirement while pursuing a doctorate in classical Chinese. [Never think of a Marine as dumb!!]<br/><br/>Then consider this:<br/>The first person to translate the Art of War into a Western language was a French Jesuit in 1752 -- a time when France was reeling from its loss of Canada and seeking covert ways to encourage and support rebellion in the colonies. If you read "1775", you'll see we followed Sun-Tzu to the letter. By then, Patriots contolled colonies, but the British didn't see that. So, the mightest nation on earth sent an elite special forces team to Worcester, which never made past Concord, MA where it was mauled in retreat by veterans of the French and Indian war. Our revolution began in earnest at Bunker Hill where England lost 25% of all the officers it lost throughout the war -- in a single day.<br/>George Washington took over on 3July1775 to let the world know we were playing for "keeps." No turning back, and looking for allies.<br/>BTW - if you never noticed, the Earth is furthest from the sun on 4 July.

1) Why can't the Times write a piece about Bernie Sanders as a candidate, instead of those ostensibly about him but really talking about something else, like The Little Musical That Could, or Hillary Clinton?<br/><br/>2) I'll bet that if you researched Barack Obama's stature in the public eye 16 months before the 2008 election, no one had ever heard of him outside Illinois, either. Go Bernie!

I'd love to know how many reviewers cakes looked the the "fine crumb" slice in the picture?  Mine weighed a TON, and consisted of a lot more fat (cream of coconut, coconut milk and butter) than seemed necessary to produce a moist, light coconut cake.  It's like adding another stick of butter to the 2 it already calls for - and pre-sweetened.  Also, depending on how finely shredded you are able to buy your coconut, adding it to the batter, and between the layers seems like overkill - especially when you attempt to slice through it and it produces a mess instead of a slice.  Miles too much powdered sugar and butter for frosting - I stopped after the first box and a quarter and the frosting was still very sweet.  I still have enough left over for another layer and I frosted all three!  This is one heavy, heavy sweet cake and although it tasted good, my guests all felt like they would have a heart attack.   I would rethink the entire recipe before attempting  again...there has got to be a mistake in the proportions.

Oh yeah? The people who came together and presented this edition to the King were themselves Barons and such. The "people" were more or less, mostly more, still surfs that had no rights and no more rights thanks to the Magna Carta. Rights of the people? Even if you don't know law you should at least learn some English history before believing what is said by people 800 years after the fact!

Why are you so opposed to the study of Magna Carta?  It's an important historical document and one whose historiography has changed significantly over time.  The alternate interpretation of "The Myth of the Magna Carta" has only been around for about a hundred years, and it's shed a lot of light on our understanding of medieval England.  Even today, new evidence is being discovered on the origins and the reign of "bad King John" almost necessitating historical revisionism.  As Keynes said: "When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?"<br/><br/>On the subject of tedium, I can appreciate that most people don't have the temperament for precise, detail-oriented, analytical work.  That may make the inner workings of scientific and historical disciplines seem extraordinarily dull, but I certainly wouldn't say they should be abandoned (let alone outlawed!)

Seriously??!! The "people" have the right to pass whatever (hairbrained, unconstitutional) laws or amendments they want, but ALL laws, whether passed by their state legislatures or “the will of the people” via a referendum, must pass FEDERAL Constitutional muster! It serves to prevent the “tyranny of the majority” from denying equal rights and the equal protection of the law to a minority.  <br/><br/>This is basic civics &amp; gov't 101, yet sadly, i see uneducated comments like yours every day! You would do well to familiarize yourself with the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution which applies to ALL citizens and reads: <br/><br/>"ALL persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, ARE citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. NO State shall make or enforce ANY law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; NOR shall ANY State deprive ANY person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; NOR deny to ANY person within its jurisdiction the EQUAL protection of the laws. <br/><br/>It is the RIGHT and DUTY of the FEDERAL courts - SCOTUS ultimately - in our *tripartite* Constitutional Republic,  to make sure that the laws passed by the “will of the people” or legislatures pass Constitutional muster. It is their RIGHT and DUTY to make that assessment and to strike them down if not Constitutional when a case is brought.

Otherwise pensions would literally NEVER end, they'd be passed from generation to generation. <br/><br/>I am sure the residents of your grandmother's home state -- who actually guarantee that absurdly generous pension -- are thrilled to have to pay it to a woman who NEVER TAUGHT SCHOOL and is only in her 50s.<br/><br/>Either you misunderstand the arrangement, OR some terrible fraud is being perpetrated here.

But what does it mean to feel like a woman?  My lack of understanding, as a biological woman, is based on not knowing what this means.  When a boy cries because his mother puts him pants and not a dress on the first day of kindergarten, there isn't a sexual context. He's pre-pubescent.  He just wants to wear a dress.  I say:  let him!  If that's what "being a girl" (or a woman) is all about, if that's what gender is reduced to. But as a feminist, when Jenner reduces his strong, lifelong desire to wearing nail polish (as he did) it can't help but offend.

Genetics? How absurd! Has the gene pool changed over the past 50 years. Inconceivable.<br/>The food industry has addicted us to high caloric foods, high fructose corn syrup etc.<br/>it is very rare to  see people lose weight and maintain that loss. Only 2 ways  to lose weight and keep it off. One is bariatric surgery, and the other is emigrate to a country where being fat is rare. There would be no obesity problem in the US if the blah blah blahing consumed calories.

Just how bad are our universities if we have to recruit better technical expertise offshore? Management preyed on the low hanging fruit first by moving the workers and factories overseas. Now it's time to abash the college educated worker. From data center callers to physicians and every discipline in between, the profit incentive is in play. What to do?<br/>This is one grandpa that will vote with not just the ballot, but, with his wallet. My grandchildren will not, I repeat, will not be taken to Disney any where!

"The Trans-Pacific Partnership and a President’s Legacy"?<br/><br/>NO "legacy" is better that a BAD "legacy" or one with a documented bad path for the nation after the president leaves office<br/>(cf. Clinton and NAFTA--sold with all the same lines and we've seen how well THAT worked out for jobs--Bush's legacy of torture, international illegality, and endless war, or even Johnson's legacy (Vietnam and social unrest, not vast social change as he'd planned for his Great Society)<br/><br/>Working about carving a place in history and being utterly egomaniacal about it at the end of a second terms seems to infect all presidents...sad...for the nation!

SAY WHAT?  Silly me!  Here I thought that only Dubya had a language processing problem.  Now it turns out that Jeb was also born with a silver foot in his mouth.  But which side did it come from?  I've always thought of Daddy Bush as self-effacing and adequately communicative, though he himself has said that he's not the most articulate guy around.  Must be Mommy Bush, then!  Her comment about the plight of survivors of Katrina from New Orleans housed in the Texas Superdome that they were making out quite well, set a new standard for nastiness in political discourse.  I guess that in the Bush bear family garden, Daddy Bush likes his porridge too hot, Baby Bears like their porridge mixed up and Mama Bush likes her porridge downright nasty!

Why should tax dollars go to support an industry that currently creates so little of value for the nation as a whole?  The purpose of Wall Street these days seems mainly to use clever maneuvers to fleece outsiders of their truly-earned money to line the pockets of a few private individuals.  Let the Wall Street CEOs shed a few of the mega-millions and billions they reap (I wouldn't say it is "earned") and pay for what they think is needed themselves, if they truly think that will keep those jobs in New York.  <br/><br/>This is where the arguments made by this article falls apart:  if the cost of living is far cheaper everywhere else and these back-office jobs, which produce no tangible goods, can pretty much be done anywhere, what guarantees that any public funds expended won't just be pocketed (again!) as by the fat-cats at the top of the industry, as "profits"?

What do you think they are teaching future executives at Harvard, Yale and the Wharton School?  How to get bigger pay checks and bonuses and perks for themselves.  They are learning how to run a business into the ground for their own personal enrichment.  That is why America is no longer a world class business leader. Mitt Romney is a case I. point. I still can't believe people voted for him!

The New York Times and other papers keep deeming this horrible bill key to President Obama's legacy, but according to whom is the TPP central to his legacy? Did he SAY this? Who is saying this? Why do we keep hearing this, and who is this supposed assertion of a legacy for?<br/><br/>This president already has a substantial legacy that will place him among the best and worst presidents in US history. On the plus side, he saved the country from financial collapse, and presides over a growing economy, especially for the very rich; put us on the path to energy security more than any other president; passed the most sweeping health care law that has brought health insurance to 16 million more Americans and prevented over 169 million from losing their coverage because of pre-existing conditions; passed the strongest financial reform bill in several generations; pushed for visionary equality legislation (ending DOMA and DADT); and appointed two brilliant women to the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>On the deficit side there are the drones; Guantánamo (which he didn't start but didn't end either); growing inequality; the horrible secrecy and prosecution of whistleblowers; and the ongoing mess in the Middle East.<br/><br/>With all of this to speak for, why is TPP central to his legacy? For whom? Global corporations? Billionaires? Give us a break!

Why is every story about Obama primarily concerned with his legacy? Is the NYT Obama's press office? Why doesn't the NYT write as a representative of the people? I don't care how anything Obama does effects his legacy! He has failed. I do care that Obama's actions have left the Middle East in turmoil, our economy on life support, Russia and China increasingly provocative, our military weaker than it was before World War I and our government personnel records in the hands of our enemies. Obama has weakened the USA in every way he could. That is his legacy.

How are they denied the "means" not to get pregnant?<br/><br/>1. 100% free Medicaid welfare (which pays for every form of BC, including sterilization).<br/>2. Obamacare, which also pays 100% of contraception.<br/>3. Every drugstore, gas station and supermarket (including Walmart) sells birth control, both prescription and over-the-counter types.<br/>4.

I am hoping (against hope?) that the USWNT's strategy is to hang back a bit and do the basic minimum needed to advance, then come out guns blazing once out of the group stage.  Part of this fantasy requires Morgan to not be so injured after all, and Wambach to find her mojo again. But I agree with other poster who said the "if you have a hammer everything looks like a nail" problem applies to their scoring strategy with Wambach.  They need a couple other good plans, besides the Rapinoe cross to the Wambach noggin.<br/><br/>In any case, my daughters and are enjoying watching excellent women's soccer from so many different teams...  but c'mon USA!

Last week, the NYT Sunday Review ran an op ed entitled "What Makes a Woman?" that was essentially a hate piece directed at trans people by Elinor Burkett, a cis gender feminist. It accused trans people, particularly trans women, of being walking gender stereotypes who are undoing the hard work of generations of feminists. It was presented in a sympathetic tone ("Of course we feminists want to fight oppression! But we can't accept trans people until they change their antifeminist ways.") And taking that tone, rather than the forthright hate visible in many comments on this Retro Report piece that call us crazy sexual fetishists walking around in disguises, it had a mass appeal. It was the most e-mailed NYT story for several days.<br/><br/>This shows how far we have to go.<br/><br/>I am a trans man married to a trans woman, and both of us have been feminists all our lives. Of all the people I have met in my life, if you pick a random trans person and a random cis person, the trans person is more likely to identify as a feminist. This is due to our experiences, both with thinking a lot about gender as we realize we wish to gender transition, and to the gender policing we must deal with when we do so.<br/><br/>It's a sad demonstration of the power of transphobia that we face derision and exclusion, not just from social conservatives who are also homophobic and think "feminist" is a bad word, but from people who frame themselves as social progressives and supporters of same-gender relationships.

Why don't we just require that all politicians drop their last names completely?<br/>Then they can add in the diminutive to their first name that will make their politics more palatable to their constituents. Jebbie. Hillie. Teddie. Randi. Much more friendly sounding. Even our kids might like them. Except, perhaps for "Randi." Not a good idea for kids, I think.<br/>Or, we can bracket what would have been their last name with (no last name required).<br/>Or, better yet, we append a favorite character from, say, Game of Thrones, to their name and we could get voters really excited. House of Wall Street: Hillary the Slayer.<br/>House Beyond the Wall: Jeb NoJoy. No House at All: Ted Whatsisname.<br/>After all, we have one candidate already, who in a Robin Hood moment, promises that every American will get the same chance she did to "make ends meet." Or was it, earn a living wage? Can't remember - there have been so many promises. Must have been earn $200K for a speech or two. And then "the challenger" seems bent on leaving his personal legacy at the back door - except for the cash withdrawals from his family's ATM. Can't decide to use your surname? Just turn it into a new logo. Rebrand…it's the way of the world, and everyone is doing it. Hillary is now "Nixonian" in her political probity. I can envision a "Hillary's The One" campaign with her surrounded by her favorite average Americans. Jeb could Hispanicize his logo with "Esto Es Jeb! - Vota, vota, vota!"<br/>Frankly, the whole thing is silly.

What is this "legacy" business the media has been harping on all year? The president's job is to lead the country, and to be not only responsive to, but fighting for the people who brought him to the party.<br/>Somehow there was a collective delusion about Obama. I smelled a rotten fish when the media appointed him their darling, the next president, after he gave a 5 minute speech at Kerry's convention. And as the NY Times once reported, he had his speech writer pattern his words and cadences on Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Which is to say, for a while, he gave some good speeches, and a lot of college students bought it. Maybe it's time to raise the voting age rather than lower it!!!! Identity politics was the other half of the equation that brought us this stealth corporate weakling.<br/>People were telling me even before he was elected that he was the Manchurian candidate. I scoffed even though I saw him for what he was (actually not so, he is way way worse than I ever imagined.) It turns out they were right.

Great introduction, especially in todays America, to the perplexing and often vexing question as to:" What is Race?" I note even such luminarys of Black culture  as Malcolm X  struggled mightly with that question, and Malcolm (if one reads his Autobiograpy closely) may  in fact  have lost his life over the non-resolution of that question. And certainly our own current President, Barrick Obama, acknowledges a long and only partially resolved self struggle with the question of his own race. So,WHY NOT open the question up  of who or what constitutes being a member of a certain Race-Certainly, the genetists amoung us (to say nothing of the out right racialists) seem to be as confused as the rest of us!

How can an ostensibly smart person launch his campaign treating voters like we are stupid? Will he tell us the ACA is not working when it clearly is?  His brother is his advisor on the middle east?

FREE SPEECH?  Speech is not going to be free on the Internet much longer, if the Republicans have their way.  There is to be unequal access to the public property (i.e., broadband access), since only those who pay a higher price will be able to use the public property of cyberspace at top speed.  Since corporations have the same rights as people and unlimited anonymous funds can be used for any political purpose, since the donors are unaccountable, clearly those who have no access to unlimited funds no longer have unlimited access to free speech, or to public property, either.  This scenario reeks of social engineering by the Republicans and their operatives on a level that outstrips anything the Democrats have even dreamt of!  Why are the Republicans becoming more and more exclusionary and elitist over time?  Very simply, because they can!  How long will it be before we have to start paying to submit these comments?  Gee, I guess I let the cat out of the bag!

Where HAVE all the "normal weight" people gone? I can't say that I know too many. I recently helped in cleaning out my mum's home after she passed away. My sisters and I spent a considerable amount of time looking through boxes of old photographs. They were photos of my mum at summer camp, of her father ( a teacher) with his enormous classes of 40 children or more, of our relatives dating back to the 1930's, her wedding photos and photos of her classes which she taught in the 1950's and into the 1970's. In all the photos the subjects were of normal weight, what we might call "thin" these days. We might even call them "skinny" or "scrawny". In my mother's day, one did not go to the gym or run on a treadmill. She walked or rode her bicycle to school but did not exercise excessively. I can only draw the conclusion that she and her contemporaries ate much less than we do now.<br/><br/>I recently took my normal weight 17 year old daughter in to have her prom dress fitted for the final time. The dress was a size 0 and had to be taken in<br/>quite a bit. The staff at the dress shop were amazed and had to gather around and comment on how "tiny" my daughter was, and that the smallest dress they could find was too big. Apparently, " normal weight" is not that normal anymore. (I am suspicious that what is labelled a size 0 now was probably a size 6 when my mother was a teenager. Not only are we much larger now we are also much more vain!).

The flagging sense of community ridicule and shaming of unmarried women giving births ? That is a damning evidence of the retrogressive evolution of community. Bush is right about the need of a father or a father figure in a child's life. But why does the sanctimonious community blame the unmarried mother only? Don't they know a baby is the result of a sperm and ovum fusion?  The sperm-donor vanishes and the woman is left holding the bag ( literally ). It becomes a living nightmare for the mother to keep body and soul together - her baby's and her own. And the community badgers and shames her alone Also she is blamed only for couples who co-habit. That is again just to shame the woman because the couple decides not to have a piece of paper! It would help a great deal if solutions are found to end this cycle so that every child's potential is realized. For starters, we can stop the disappearance of 1.5 million to incarceration. We should find absentee dads and make them pay for child support and maintenance. If they don't a heavy penalty follows or they are given opportunities like jobs and forced into drug rehab. programs. The moms need help too where they can find decent jobs and childcare services. And most important- don't interfere with a woman's choice to have an abortion. It is her body, her life and a decision between her and her doctor. The community and the hypocritical and sanctimonious politicians and clergy cannot have their cake and eat it too!

The TPP has (was?) been foisted upon us and we've been told to be 'good' and accept it. Really? Some of us are actually tired of the 'masters of the universe' deciding our fate. As for Democrats being Democrats, I don't feel they've gotten their 'mojo' back YET. Working on it though. Definitely. Friday's vote on TPP was evidence of that. I'm quite certain Hillary is more than qualified to be President. Our first woman as President (others have beaten us to that). And she's desperately trying to say 'the right things'. My fear is, it's only because Bernie is out there pushing those ideas. And my last caveat: Democrats can ONLY BE Democrats when Hillary (or ANY Democrat) can run without $1B. Republicans included!

How indeed? You assume the people having children outside of wedlock are at least physically mature, that their brains have reached full development. That assumption will be erronerous with we are talking about people under the age of about 25. People under that age are at the height of reproductive readiness (early 20s) but lacking in the cognitive functioning necessary for impluse control. What's a mother (or in this case nation) to do? <br/><br/>We can begin by acknowledging the reality that the human sex drive is very powerful, so powerful that we use it to sell everything! Universal comprehensive sex education starting in middle school and provision of free birth control have to be part of the solution. It unrealistic to think that shaming and finger wagging are going to be stronger than the sex drive supplied by Mother Nature. We are hard wired for sex, not for good judgment. <br/><br/>In this country we tell young adults to "wait until marriage" to begin sexual activity. It has been as abject a failure as the "Just say no" silliness and War on Drugs have been at curbing drug use. In Europe, teens are taught "no sex without a condom". That is more realistic.

How can a man who disowns his own family be trusted? Not that I blame the guy. Who would'nt? But family is family for better or for worse. That said, the declaration, "I know I can fix this because I've done it " sounds very ominous What has he done in Florida as Governor? Ruin it. Ask the retirees there whose lives have taken a nose-dive. And one cannot forget the part where he actually stole - stole an election for his brother ( along with our wise, complicit Supreme Court Justices ). And his Foreign Affairs experience ? He went to Europe and showed extreme curiosity UNLIKE his brother! On the plus side, he does not wear glasses for effect like Perry, he is a relative moderate compared to the likes of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and unlike Scott Walker he is not a college drop-out ( but no genius either ). He is the most moderate of the Republican fray where women's issues are concerned. And most important - with this delayed announcement he has assured that his coffers are full ( although stretching and bending the rules  as much as possible).

"Misrepresenting her biological ancestry was an ethical lapse"?<br/><br/>QUITE an "ethical lapse" (aka lie, misrepresentation, falsification of background, etc)!  <br/><br/>But she's still got her academic appointment--based in part on her bogus bio and background.  Most academic instructions will fire someone with falsified background or credentials (especially since you sign something specifically attesting to the truthfulness of your info, when hired, usually upon pain of termination for cause)<br/><br/>Will she do the "honorable" thing with her academic gig, before she gets fired?   I'd bet not.  <br/><br/>But as the old Magic 8 Ball said, "the future is cloudy"!

"That her body did not conform to her self-identity"  ? <br/><br/>It's not her "body"; it's her genetics!<br/>Which has nothing to do with how you identify or your self image.  Anyone is free to identify with whatever ethnicity they like, or whatever body image they like.  But claiming your genetics are something else, is simply contrary to the fact of science.<br/><br/>But, that said, I agree with your point that this whole flap is "much ado about not much" in the larger scheme of all the reel issues in the world actually affecting the lives of most people: jobs, food, war, etc...

Which corporations and industries make money if we eat less? No one! That's why gym memberships, home gym equipment, gatorade, nutritional supplements, and Biggest Loser tv shows (which have advertisements for all of the above) flourish in our society. Not to mention all the food sold everywhere these days (shopping malls, hardware stores, car washes etc) - a generation ago the only place to eat was at home!

Wait, what?!<br/>I can just give up the sugary sodas and I'll lose weight?<br/>Is that all it takes?!!?!?!?<br/>My cousin gave up beer for Lent and lost 8 lbs.  I never drank beer to begin with, so giving it up gave me no weight loss.  Have had one or two soda's in the past year, a ginger ale to quell the occasional nausea -- it's not a diet staple.  So cutting it out has had zero measurable effects.<br/><br/>What does make the difference, for me, is exercise -- and a particular type:  weight training.  If I lift weights, I remain slim &amp; toned.  If I ease back into only endless cardio, I get a thick midsection and spongy, floofy arms.<br/>The conclusion I draw from my sample size of exactly one is that any discussion of diet versus exercise that doesn't account for different types of exercise is a load of hooey.  A 30 minute walk or jog is really no where near the same as 30 minutes of pumping iron.  No. Where. Near.

Brienne - you do realize that Stannis was a dead man, with or without you, eh?

Jack, you do realize she is most likely a sociopath? It is a known fact she is a pathological liar. She should be prosecuted for the false hate crimes she has been committing against her "white self", and reporting them. I feel sorry for her parents. Ms. Dolezal also needs a tremendous amount of psychological help, but I doubt she will see it that way. She will be too busy sharpening her story and lies for her book deals.<br/><br/>I want someone to please tell me all about Ms. Dolezal's great works she did to help black Americans, so I can benefit from being black, as much as she has!

How does that even make sense? How are you able to decide on what gender you want to be and not race even though you are BORN with BOTH! It's a very basic comment that either comes from ignorance or you just want to hop on this Caitlyn bandwagon. If we are gonna praise a 65 yr old man for becoming a woman, then why not praise rachel for changing her race and on top of that doing nothing but positivity with it. Alot of you people are foolish to think one is ok and the other isnt when they are both the SAME. They both relate to how these individuals are identifying themselves, so if you think rachel is crazy then bruce must be crazy too...

The Biggest Loser is your family's favorite show? Despite everything else you have written, I cannot get past that first line. As a mental health professional who treats eating disorders (23 deaths a day, 30 million sufferers in the US), I am appalled that anyone supports a show that demeans others, shames obesity and sends a message that losing weight is a competition, a game! <a href="http://proud2bme.org/content/biggest-loser-contestant-kai-hibbard-speaks-out" title="http://proud2bme.org/content/biggest-loser-contestant-kai-hibbard-speaks-out" target="_blank">http://proud2bme.org/content/biggest-loser-contestant-kai-hibbard-speaks...</a>

Can we talk about the impact of car culture on this epidemic, as well? Many of our communities are designed so it is unsafe or unappealing to be able to walk or bike nearby to accomplish simple errands like shopping or even walking to school. I lived in a community where my neighbor wouldn't even allow her daughter to collect the mail on the street of her house because there was no sidewalk and cars regularly sped by (and occasionally crashed) at 55 MPH. I love the convenience of a car to get to remote places, but we need to restructure our cities and suburbs to encourage safe walking and biking over car commuting for local needs. It's ridiculous. Motor vehicle accidents are the largest killer of children according to the CDC. If a drug or a food were killing that many children per year we would be outraged. Yet we accept death by car as if it were inevitable and unchangeable, like earthquakes, rather than seeing it as a choice we make (or one that the structure of our communities makes). We are literally sacrificing our children here, people. It's time to make some change. I don't see anything in the Constitution that privileges auto transport over other transport. Walking is a civil right. What do we celebrate first after a child is born? Their first steps!! We need to take back our right to walk in this country.

Seriously?!? You actually think there are many people who "deny" "climate change"? I haven't heard anyone or read anyone claim that there haven't been multiple Ice Ages and interglacials and so forth.<br/>If instead you mean "human-driven climate change", it would be helpful to spell that out, since otherwise it seems like a "merchants of doubt" type of claim.  Science is precise; these sorts of vague claims and allusions to e.g. Holocaust denial are not in the public interest.

Where in Hawaii do you suggest the 'pumped storage' reservoirs be located? Whose homes will you destroy? Not the rich ocean side mansions but the poor, away from the tourist centers. In Germany the main result of large solar and wind power facilities  is also a sharp increase in coal-fired power plants, yeasrs after they were shuttered for clean nuclear! Coal is obsolete yet German usage is UP over the last 5 years, not down!

What about non-competitive sports or physical activities?  I used to absolutely dread gym.  Yet I was a decent athlete and wound up becoming a dancer (big shock to my classmates and parents who truly thought I was hopeless!)<br/><br/>But, some of us think team sports are rather frightening, especially if they involve mean people who form cliques (otherwise known as "teams") and also if they involve fast moving objects such as balls (otherwise known as Things That Might Break My Nails:)<br/><br/>Seriously - we don't provide for individualism much at all.  This includes dance, but also encouraging people to get out and walk, look at nature.  Horses are expensive for individuals but maybe communities could figure out how to maintain some kind of pony club - little girls and boys who hate "sports," who aren't competitive by nature and dread being picked on gym class, sometimes love riding. <br/><br/>This helps people integrate with nature too, which is increasingly remote and contributes, I think, to our feeling alienated from our own planet.

You bring up a relevant point: to what degree must an entire family go on a diet, in order to accommodate one member? The lead paragraphs here show a mother, who resents being told what SHE can eat (or have in the house) in order to (MAYBE) get her child to eat less or slim down.<br/><br/>What about the other children? If they are slim or average weight, do they have to give up treats or snacks -- because their sibling cannot easily control  their weight or their appetite? Must the parents? Frankly, that is going to be a losing cause. The child forced on a diet is ALWAYS going to feel like an outsider -- blamed because "we can't have ice cream BECAUSE OF YOU!" -- made to feel different or ugly or inferior.<br/><br/>Those things are 1000 times worse than being fat. How sad that you had to give up eating with your own family -- in order to "diet". Did that work out? How do you feel about missing so many meals and bonding experiences with your family -- chasing an ideal of physical beauty, that may not have been possible anyways?

Why do we care?  Simple:  because shes a liar!<br/><br/>If NAACP and any other orgs want to hire people outside of their own demographic I fully support it. In fact that would add consensus and credibility. <br/><br/>But this is one big fraud - and does a huge disservice to the cause.

What's with these parents? Why did the parents adopt 4 black children?  Did this teach Rachel, at a young age, that her folks preferred black childen over their two white ones? I read on some blog that the parents are religious cultists who home-schooled Rachel until she was in her teens. Who knows what they programmed into her head? Yes, she's an adult, now, but Dolezal's growth as an adult and ability to live with her true self seemingly involves ovecoming a lot of cognitive dissonance, courtesy of her parents. Maybe they told her she was born in a teepee? (They did admit they lived in one!) Maybe one of the myths they told their children was that Jesus witnessed their births...or something equally nutty? Kids believe what their parents tell them; they have no choice. Children who grow up in religious cults have many difficulties upon reaching adulthood. It's tough to survive comfortably in a reality that's nothing like the fantasy that had been presented to them. Of their two white children, the Dolezal parents have a son on trial for sexual abuse of a minor, and the other is being hunted by villagers with pitchforks for assuming an identity other than the one THEY claim belongs to her. One of their black children wanted to be away from his parents so badly, ultimately a court decided to give his sister (Rachel Dolezal) legal guardianship of him. These people have some screws loose. It's obvious that their conflicting racisms caused a lot of their terrible behaviors.

What exactly does "denialism" deny?  I understand that the word itself evokes the spectre of evil as in Holocaust denial, but nobody ever seems to be able to state what exactly is being denied here.<br/>If this weren't such a serious subject, it would make for a classic Monty Python skit!

How many times have you heard this statement?<br/><br/>Don't tell me how to raise my child!<br/><br/>That's a big part of the problem.  Children don't come into this world with an instruction manual. Parenting is an on the job training program of the most difficult kind.  No two kids are alike.  Parenting is a journey of discovery, hardship and joy.  Far too many parents don't want to listen to any advice.  They don't know how to use the dreaded "N" word, No.  Give the kid what he or she wants to keep them from complaining.  They want sugar and they get it.  They want crunchy snacks and they get them.  They want video toys and they get them.  <br/><br/>I have had parents tell me things like, "My Johnny played in the yard for an hour.  He got exercise."  Kids can keep moving their entire waking hours.  They can run and play and jump and climb all day long.  One hour is nothing.  We played constantly, only stopping for food and mother's call to come in for the evening.<br/><br/>Parents do not want to consider, let alone accept that they may be doing something wrong.  Our politically correct society prevents other correcting them.  My mother would yell at any parent she thought was doing wrong.  They thanked her later.  <br/><br/>Parents have become enablers of childhood obesity.  Tough love seems to be a forgotten concept.  There are other way to show a child you love them besides feeding them all the junk they want.  <br/><br/>I'm not too thrilled with modern parents.  They aren't like my mom.

Do you want to see this problem in a nutshell? Then read all the posts here that insist we shame and embarrass children &amp; their parents -- one woman wants all fat children forcibly taken from their families and put into foster homes (where presumably harsh foster parents will systematically starve them into slimness!). Someone basically is inferring that all fat people are "stupid". Other imply laziness -- greed -- selfishness -- ignorance -- gluttony.<br/><br/>Imagine how a fat person feels in this culture, when every article and diet book and media piece is aimed straight against them? They are alleged to cause every cost in the health care system (just them!). They are considered hideously ugly and undesirable. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, a million different "experts" (most without the slightest training or science to back them up) have a million different theories -- eat only vegetables. Eat only low carb. Eat only what you cook yourself. Give up all sweets. Give up all carbohydrates. Give up all gluten. Give up all soda pop, etc. Except that NONE OF THESE is proven to cause permanent weight loss -- many times (most times) diets BACKFIRE and end up causing MORE and not less obesity -- by making people (especially kids!) feel deprived and miserable. <br/><br/>A child who feels singled out and shamed -- a child who is made to hate their own body and image -- a child who is told he can't eat the ordinary things that all children love -- is a child who is almost certainly going to grow into a fat adult.

"I bought some wine at Target (house red?) The checkout girl carded me. I don't look my age (64), but I certainly look 50! I was dumbstruck. "I'm sorry sir, it's Target policy." I left the wine and other junk there and walked out, it was too crazy to cooperate with."<br/><br/>Charles, let me get this straight.  You were actually OFFENDED because a cashier thought you were a LOT younger than you are?  Most people would consider that either a complement -or- an indication that the cashier had trouble with determining someone's age.<br/><br/>I don't look my age either and I have been flattered when I got attention from men young enough to be my son.  By your logic I should have been offended.<br/><br/>The first time my dad got carded it was to prove that he was old enough for a senior citizen's discount.  He came home with a BIG smile on his face!

The taxpayers should have been more generous?!?<br/><br/>Is anyone else as sick of people like Judge Wheeler and Maurice Greenberg as I am?<br/><br/>What an absurd ruling, Judge Wheeler. The taxpayers were overly generous because Maurice Greenberg, and the rest of these bankers who brought us to the edge of a fiscal cliff in 2008 with unethical, criminal behavior didn't go to jail.

Hasn't' anyone heard? More than a decade ago the findings of the Human Genome Project revealed that there isn't enough genetic deviation from one person to another on this earth to classify someone as a different species (race). We're all human--all people. We come in different colors, genders, innate behaviors; but no one can be classified as a different race. More revealing from the Genographic Project, we find that all modern man originated from Africa. So, en route to wherever we find ourselves today, because of environmental factors, some people have darker skin than others, and have been mating with each other since. <br/><br/>So all this talk about what race people believe is really about ignorance; because do a DNA test, for one, offered by the Genographic Project, and we find that we have genes from most of the world's population in each of us! So who is the true "black" person, the true "white?" They don't exist because we all started out with dark skin in Africa! But only those who want to perpetuate divisiveness and supremacy persist with this conversation. Better yet, Teach our children that humans come in different colors, sizes, shapes, genders, and innate behaviors, and no one had a choice, but on the inside the variation of our genes are insignificant in meaning. Maybe then racism will fade into history.

Have the family of Rachel Dolezal done any research on their ancestry ?<br/>If they have how many generations they have gone back with such ?esearch ?<br/>The answer would be NO.<br/>Yet they were so busy exposing their own who wants to dedicate her life to fight for the cause of Blacks !

"The taxpayers should have been more generous?!?"<br/><br/>I believe that "The taxpayers should have been more generous OR  not have made a deal at all" is a more accurate reading.

Hey, what's the problem?  How can these people be bad when they are WHITE MALES?  This is America!  These MEN need to be treated with RESPECT!  Don't you know that only darker skinned people are thugs?  <br/><br/>And what is this using statistics and logic to show that these PATRIOTIC AMERICANS are a way more real threat than those muslims?  Ain't no math or science in the BIBLE.

Improve the lot of the world's poor by exporting our jobs and lowering our wages? Why that would be...REDISTRIBUTION!! All your buddies on the right hate when that happens, David!<br/><br/>No, you don't raise the living standards of others in the world by lowering the living standards of more and more people in the U.S. When knee-jerk free trade conservatives and their delusional think tanks come up with a corrective to solve that problem, then we might be able to take them seriously.

EricF "What was the point of Anthony Watts original email?"<br/><br/>The man was just upset by the idea of giving up satellite data, going back to buckets and adjusting the bucket results as well.<br/><br/>Just to try to get a ridiculous 64th excuse for the lack of atmospheric warming. No effect after a full 1/4 of all CO2 historically emitted by humans.<br/><br/>Anthony is idealistic enough to think that science is done the old way, for an interest in what is really happening behind the data.<br/><br/>Rather than, as in climate science or with tobacco doctors, with scientists being paid handsomely to reach a predetermined conclusion, profitable to their employer.<br/><br/>And, my, oh my! reaching it.<br/><br/>Just how many people will fall for the 64 excuses put together, instead of "What is he/she talking about? Satellites show no warming for two decades now!"<br/><br/>Time will show, and so far the answer is: very few.<br/>****<br/>A lot of people, many who gullibly fall for the climate scam, mistake the real reason for which scientists use evolution rather than creationism.<br/><br/>The reason is that the explanation provided by evolution is simpler.<br/><br/>To say:<br/>There were a few dozen warmings of 1C/century in the last 10000 years, <br/><br/>the warming 1910-1940 was natural (since CO2 emissions were 1/10 of the historic total)<br/><br/>but the nearly identical warming 1970-2000 was human made,<br/><br/>since all the previous physics miraculously ceased to function but was amazingly replaced by CO2 physics with THE SAME EFFECTS,<br/><br/>That's as convoluted as creationism...

I thought the same things: that someone would sneak up behind Brienne (Ramsey?  No!!), and that the angle for a de-cap was awkward.  Brienne is one of the coolest and most satisfying female characters ever; a great blend of masculine and feminine qualities.  I have been frustrated by her waiting for the candle signal-didn't even realize she knew about the candle arrangement.  An overall frustrating element of GoT is the start/stall/stop pacing for so many characters.  Where was Varys all that time?  Looking around the brothel?  But on another note, did anyone expect Theone to get back in the game?  Go Reek!

But what about the children who don't discover "making 10" on their own?  Not everyone is very good at pattern recognition.<br/>I actually posted that link up on facebook once before, and I had my friends from high school mockingly yelling at me for the triangle in a box trick saying "you knew all these kinds of tricks in school, and you never told any of us?!"<br/>Why hide all this away from kids and hope that they pick it up on their own?  Not everyone is intrinsically that good at math.  Why not just teach them?

Could you provide a link to this research that you quote?  Also please note that the global warming scientific community is actually quite a diverse one and does not draw exclusively from folks who lean left.  As more data comes in, those who were initially skeptical have reconsidered their positions.  At the end of the day, if the climate change deniers are right, there really is no harm done - we simply would have multiple forms of energy available and we'll all bow down to them.  However, if they are wrong (which is more likely), then we just would have screwed the planet beyond recognition through inaction.  And all so that they can have some grant money and 2 seconds of fame?  C'mon!

David, Is one of the requirements for reading this column an annual salary of 500 K or more? For wealthy Republicans only?<br/><br/>"Impoverish the world's poor," "Damage the American economy," "Stifle future innovation," "Imperil world peace:" good heavens! <br/><br/>This litany of foolishness sounds like an advertisement encouraging the public to go Republican.

So you want to reward corporations for avoiding taxation again? Bush 2 let them bring their money back and it did nothing. And just how are you going to tie it to job creation? It's easy enough to create a position and shuffle someone into it, call it new and then lay it off for a million dollars.<br/><br/>Lowering the minimum wage while providing subsidies? So working welfare? You want the government to cover the costs because employers can get away with not paying a living wage? That's already happening throughout the service industry. How does increasing the government's share of wages to private sector employees through transfers make the situation better? If a private sector company can't pay the cost of a full wage for a full time position because the position doesn't add enough value then it shouldn't exist period! Why should tax payers shoulder such costs for a marginal benefit?

So what did his father and brother achieve?  Two banking crises (with the help another Bush brother - Neil).  Four percent growth? Hardly actually a pair of recessions.  Einstein said that doing the same experiment over again and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.  Maybe that';s the tag line "JEB! Crazy enough for you?" Alternatively "JEB! Just another Economic Bust."

When did I snap off the TV for good?  When I heard it's funny to make fun of fat people.  I thought kindergarten was over but apparently not.<br/><br/>I have spent a life watching my weight (we nearly perished at school at 9 in France), and I made up for it big time at 11 in Ireland, a wonderful summer on chocolate and cake where my mother fainted when picking me up at the airport in Spain.  Angry letters exchanged, asking for my dad for an explanation.<br/><br/>A disgrace!  Don't feed her, she would shout at picnics with her friends and my peers.  All to say, 'Fat' was a capital crime in her eyes, and finally a few decades later, I heard her say 'you don't eat enough'.  Tosh.<br/><br/>We eat too much.  Enough to turn one off food.  Walking in New York, it is Restaurant Row and everywhere one turns, there is a new diner, a yoghurt place, and the display at the supermarket is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Maybe food has become an obsession to fill an empty void in our lives?  Waiting in a car outside a convenience store, I saw a young overweight boy, his overweight parents and I realized that everyone was overweight in sight.  What is happening?  <br/><br/>Exercise?  Give me a horse to ride and maybe I'll get a bicycle when living in the country.  Maybe I'll take Chance, a happy rescue dog for a daily walk, although he is much stronger and fit than me.  Maybe I'll stand up from the computer every so often and see if I can touch the floor.<br/><br/>'Let's Move' is going in the right direction and Food for the Soul is good too.

How about species? Age? Education level? ("I'm a PhD in my own mind. Respect that or you are a bigot!") Where do we draw the line with this nonsense? <br/><br/>This is what happens when society feels there is no absolute truth anymore, and they can simply construct their own reality. These are dangerous waters we are treading into.

So, somehow Mexico is able to protect its southern border, but the United States is not?<br/><br/>I guess we're lucky that Mexico is doing our job for us. That way, we don't look like heartless xenophobes. Like with most other things, we've managed to outsource that to another country. Good for us! <br/><br/>The US has no obligation to accept immigrants that do not bring positive, constructive influences into our country and upon our culture. By allowing unchecked migration from countries with high poverty and widespread ignorance (i.e. lack of education), we are hurting ourselves and, more importantly, our children, who will have to live in the future we are building.<br/><br/>We have enough poverty of our own. Adding to it helps no one and hurts those that are native to our country, as it taxes resources and takes away from our own.<br/><br/>Oh, I care about America and Americans. I guess I must be one of those heartless xenophobes, not to mention a racist and an isolationist, eh?<br/><br/>No, not at all. I just don't understand why other country's failing are our responsibility to fix, or we must accept those who will eventually bring us down to the level of the countries they've escaped from.<br/><br/>If America doesn't start thinking about itself and protecting its borders, we will have no one to blame but ourselves, when our children wake up in the third-world country we are making for them.

So you are a nut? Perfect. What about other free countries who ban private ownership of guns or in your case, countries that allow guns but also have mandatory military service (there you go, you get the keep guns, shoot guns and kill people! what a great day!) Don't see a collapse there. As far as off the dollar, really? where and when - give me details -not hearsay and anecdotes.<br/>Common sense - you mean media propaganda.<br/>So do you pay taxes, collect ss, use the post office, drive on roads, take a train, use a library, do anything that involves the word public? Then you my friend are getting the benefits from this tyrannical state.<br/>Lastly, who are you going to shoot? your neighbors, friends, police, your neighbors kids-i.e: soldiers. If in fact the Gov wants you, you will be got so tell me, when and who do you start killing?

How did the House Democrats, a minority, manage to kill the TPP bill? They voted against a worker assistance provision which normally they support, and which Republicans execrate -- so even though they are in the majority, the Republicans cannot muster enough support in their own ranks to pass the worker assistance provision. <br/><br/>Then we get David Brooks coming and commiserating with the workers of Vietnam.  If the trade deal is so, so, so important to the future of America, shouldn't he be asking Republicans to support the worker assistance provision that helps American workers?   No, no, no, that is a unwarranted concession to organized labor and for the Good of the Country and the Vietnamese, the Republicans cannot hold their noses and pass that provision.  It is all the Democrats' fault!

What else is he supposed to run on?  The real platform, removing any impediments to the 1% grabbing more?  Of taxing them even less?<br/><br/>"Growth" is the ideal platform.  The idea resonates with a public that has seen wages stagnate for a few decades now.  Recall that Brownback ran in Kansas on a platform of tax cuts that was supposed to bring a burst of growth.<br/><br/>Expect with Bush the 3rd another round of tax cuts for the wealthy, cuts in aid to the retired and sick, repeal of finance regulation and consumer protection laws.  All sold under the magic title of "growth!!"

I'm so busy and I have so little time!!<br/><br/>It's fixed, it's a racket, you are either in or out -- no matter what you do -- every so often someone else gets on the list (never to leave) but that doesn't include the rest  of us.<br/><br/>Or does it?<br/><br/><a href="http://malvernthenovel.com" title="malvernthenovel.com" target="_blank">malvernthenovel.com</a>

Really, she can't identify as white if her "child" is black?  I'm white (as anyone can see) and my daughter is biracial, but looks black and identifies herself as black.  So what?  My nephew is also biracial, and looks black and identifies himself as black, but his mother (my sister) is as white as I am.  Fortunately for all of us the divide between races is ebbing, at least slightly, but apparently Ms. Dolezal wants that divide to emerge stronger and more of a barrier than ever before!

Who is to say there is no 'therapeutic movement' in this relationship?  While not mentioned in this article surely there were other areas where Dr. Hellerstein was very effective.  Dowdy's reactions to this subject would lead me to gently back off.  I am dowdy, and like it that way.  There are no pre-conceived reactions to my appearance as I am vibrant and 'with-it' in all other areas of my life.  I think this Dowdy probably is too.  Let her be!

LOL, I wonder what you could possibly mean by "other teams using video"? You mean the story that was debunked as a hoax, the reporter who made a public and private apology, the newspaper that ran a total retraction, and the "videographer", who waited an entire season to say anything, provided no proof, and eventually admitted it never happened? I think your team lost because they underestimated their opponent. Happens all the time. You Rams fans are a truly delusional group. Well, good luck swatting away all those asterisks coming your way. Once a cheater, always a cheater right? Welcome to the club!

So let me get this straight, they allegedly hacked into the Astros computer system using passwords Jeff Luhnow left behind when he was working for the Cardinals? That's incredible if true.<br/><br/>The first thing you do when an employee leaves is revoke their access to the systems. That employee who left should be smart enough to refrain from using the same passwords that he used at his previous employer.<br/><br/>Paranoia &amp; insecurity makes us do boneheaded things, if the Cardinals really did hack the Astros.  Maybe they wanted to confirm if Jose Altuve is really 5'5" - the 2nd baseman is insane.<br/><br/>Play ball!

So, The Don wants to be taken seriously now (as opposed to when he thought of running for NY Governor?) as a Presidential candidate, but he does not treat the sitting President with any respect.  Mr. Trump has blamed Obama for everything from demonstrations against police brutality to Ebola in America.  With no global background himself, Mr. Trump called Obama's foreign policy a failure and has repeatedly cast doubt on Obama's eligibility to be President.  Trump is as cynical a person as one can find, in business or politics.  Don't let him merge his fields!

President Trump? I suppose that will all depend upon the other 393 who have registered with the Federal Election Commission and the people who support them. At least his is a unique platform--improving America's "branding." Only a complete narcissist raised up in our celebrity-conscious culture would think in those terms. <br/><br/>So, just for the sake of brevity, let me be the first to announce his departure from the race he just now joined. Mr. Trump, you are fired!

Why is it the assumption that the path to better schools is simply firing bad teachers? "Of course we have to get rid of incompetent teachers!" How tired. This plays into the narrative of bad teachers failing our kids, it faults the profession of people who have devoted their lives to working with kids for all of the failings of our society and economy. Why can't we compete? Must be bad schools! Poverty? Bad schools! Crime? Bad schools! So lazy.<br/><br/>We have some of the worst data metrics on health in the industrialized world - yet there is no assumption that we simply have bad doctors. If only we could fire lazy, bad doctors, our data comparisons with other nations would be better. No one would disagree that there are some pretty bad doctors here and there in our country, but their existence is not made the excuse for bad data. Our personal trainers and athletic coaches aren't faulted either. We instead recognize the complexities of such data, we recognize our own responsibility and the structure of our society in creating that data.<br/><br/>For education, we have embarked on a national witch hunt, playing into anti-union narratives, anti-government narratives, and, lest we not forget the face of the profession, anti-women narratives. The big corporations and noble philanthropists have to swoop in to save us, making a buck for themselves and their friends of course. In short, spare me the nonsense about measuring teachers because we HAVE to fire the bad ones.

Do I gather from this that you don't bother to have medical insurance, home owner's insurance, or car insurance because you might not need them?  Don't bother saving for retirement because you may well die before then?  No point in saving for college because your kid might not go?  I sacrifice to do all of those things, just in case (heaven forbid) I get a catastrophic illness or my house burns down, or my kid gets into a good college without great scholarship money.  Does it cut into my current consumption (heck yeah!)?  Is it worth it to prepare for things that might happen in the future, and the evidence suggests they will?  Yes!

Anyone seen Senator James Inhofe lately?<br/>When he's not embarrassing himself on the Senate floor, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee hasn't been very visible (or audible) at a time when his region of the country has been getting hit with some of the most devastating weather anywhere in the world! I don't want to be snide about this though, truly. The folks living around there, whether they voted for Inhofe or not, are having to deal with some horrifying affects of today's extreme, yet not so unusual anymore, climatic events. And no one deserves that, not even him.

Barb’s been wanting to make a Caribbean Salmon Stew and, especially after Ali’s thumbs up on Cajun salmon burgers, I thought, why not Cava? Because stewy isn’t fatty. That’s why not.<br/>But that’s retrospect. Tasting ahead, I thought, coconut milk base, bubbles? Check. Medium spice, 12% ABV? Check. Spanish/French wine heritage, Caribbean food? Check. And salmon and sparkler? A go! Also jotted down what I expected of the Gramona. I wrote, “big bubbles, lemon, and some of that Champagne yeast/nut I can never define.”<br/>Nailed the big bubbles. Even in a wine glass, it’s Poland Springs, not Pellegrino.<br/>The flavors surprised. The Gramona’s lemon is darker, softer than imagined. More preserved lemon than fresh. The nut/yeast was way darker, riper than the anticipated high-toned Champagne dryness. A contralto to Mr. F’s soprano! Lovely and deep. Also faint apple.<br/>The food match? Fail. The bubbles, shrill, unpleasant with the lean, uncreamy stew, coconut milk notwithstanding. (Sherry w the stew? Super!) The Cava nuttiness, adrift in the cilantro-y, tomato-y, broth. The 12% alcohol got lit up by the 3/4s small jalapeno. And the mood was off. The food, a calypso party. The Cava, dignified and Catalan proud. (A thyme garnish helped bridge food to Euro wine.)<br/>No bridge needed for our tiny side of crispy, garlicky asparagus. It shared a pull-back-the-corners-of-your-mouth, subtly sophisticated air with the nutty Cava. Alas, Cava and asparagus were wallflowers at the sloshy Carib beach bash.

What function does Phil Pavlov's local control approach bring to the table that an unbiased third party, educationally approved system would not?!  That's the question that has to be posed since this public representative has decided to very conspicuously politicize the situation.  Children and teachers, the most important parts of the equation, are put on the back burner for the proper political sound bite that week or month at best.  Meanwhile we have 180 days to make wonderful things happen for the improvement of America's future through the most precious resource of all, tomorrow's future leaders, laborers, civil servants, and private entrepreneurs!  We must stop letting politicians take the lead regarding what's best in education, unless of course they come with a background IN EDUCATION that goes back at least 20 years, and leave it up to the legitimate education professionals who work tirelessly at their craft to create motivate that better tomorrow.

Opposing TPP = Democratic Tea Party? Ha !<br/>While Democratic Tea partiers may oppose global economic arrangements they have NOT shut down the government, opposed healthcare for poor Americans, trample civil rights, etc., etc.<br/>Too much hyperbole to let this pass.

What do we really have to lose if he's elected? In the last 20 years, both parties have sold out to special interest groups and the Presidency has been reduced to a ceremonial branch. In 2016, anyone other than a career politician is going to win my independent vote; if it's the Donald so be it! It will be a hoot to watch him stumble and fumble around on the campaign trail. However, ff he can lay out a solid business plan for the United States- without getting us in a major war- I am more comfortable with him in charge rather than a professional politician. This country needs a change- I haven't been this enthused since the appearance of Ross Perot!

Can you show us one example of when the public was given the details to a trade deal while the deal was still being worked out?  IT seems some think that we live in a direct democracy.  WE dont!  WE live in a representative democracy, meaning we elect people to govern for us.  That entails relinquishing direct input on most matters of the state.

What's this "we" and "us"?  Speak for yourself!   I'm glad, for once, that the horrific middle ages aren't being portrayed as some gigantic renaissance fair.  It was a brutal time and even though Game of Thrones is a fantastical re-imagining of the middle ages vs. an actual attempt at history, it gets it more right than some of the other Camelot-like schlock out there.   I'm enjoying the ride and hope it continues for at least a couple more seasons.

"The case is a rare mark of ignominy for the Cardinals, one of the sport’s most revered and popular organizations"?<br/><br/>Well, there is the SMALL matter of McGuire... his acknowledge cheating later lying (under oath) and/or double-talking before Congress, and his "records'--all of which the Cards obviously knew about (nudge, nudge, wink, wink..."no idea why these suddenly Popeyed-armed guys are hitting 70 homes--must be unique skill!") and tacitly accepted.<br/><br/>A climate of corruption... And may only be the tip of the iceberg.

117014
More -- apparently compulsive -- cheating in pro sports?<br/>Surprise, surprise, surprise...<br/><br/>And of course the US Justice Dept will be laying off THEM (unlike FIFA), just as they did nothing about Pats, or any of the literally thousands of cases of corruption and blatant law-breaking on Wall Street (merely costing US taxpayers and the world economy untold $billions--next to which any FIFA loot pales as chump-change)!<br/><br/>But pro sports, Wall Street, Goldman, etc, are "different", right!<br/>After all, it's all part of business, sports, and the business of sports in the good ole' USA, right?  (see no evil, hear no evil...)<br/><br/>What's also so amazing about this is that this was (again!) done by an otherwise highly successful team, just like the two documented instances of Belicheating by the Pats.  The teams would probably have won anyway!<br/><br/>As I said, 'compulsive' cheating!<br/>Just like Nixon's ultimately self-destructive Watergate antics, as the author of a recently book about Nixon discussed recently on NPR.  Like the Pats and Cards, Nixon was WAY ahead of competitors in polls and at the height of power, but he apparently couldn't stop himself in a crazed desire to destroy enemies, in particular those opposing his Vietnam War.  <br/><br/>Somehow I don't think Nixon's darkest, most compulsive urges are what sports should be channeling...

Punished?! How? She's become an instant international celebrity and the latest media darling. Prediction: she'll either be Governor of Washington,a member of Congress, or a candidate for US President in the next 5-10 years. Either that or she'll be replacing or rivalling Mr. Lauer and Ms.Harris-Perry in their media roles. Many aspiring politicians and celebrities would pay huge sums for publicity like this.

In other words, you seek to further the cause of civil rights by invoking the exact same blind prejudice as has been directed at blacks? Brilliant! "Until they "whites" treat me as equal, I refuse to treat them as equals." (sic)  Now there is the nub of the matter: you are a racist, too! Rachel Dolezal did much good for the people she identified with as being her own. Skin color should NEVER be used to differentiate  (you would lecture anyone) but you commit the same sin yourself. You are as big a hypocrite as any southern segregationist, and that attitude brings glee to all those who say that discrimination against black people does not exist. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Well just why do they have to see the results?  Now working 12 hour shifts six days a week would wear upon anybody.  Poor management is part of the issue and somewhat not vetting folks enough.  Those that are sensitive about collateral damage should be on recon missions.  Not that I could do it but I would have no problem with doing this sort of work.  Eight hours a day, five and perhaps six sometimes days a week.  Protesters should be given very long sentences especially if they are trying to stop workers going to work.  Simple!!!

Why?  Because people are turning in to watch!  Right now there are 426 comments...How many people commented when Lincoln Chaffee or Mark O’Malley announced?<br/><br/>Every prime time news cast had this story as its opening story tonight.  YOU clicked on and made a comment right?  We want great productions not just “news.”  Circus and bread (and Kardashians!)

So what's the alternative? No Republican, all of whom have one or several billionaires that entertain them can even brush Clinton's heels in terms of credibility in the "looking out for the middle class" category. A "who's your billionaire?" campaign could easily take care of Walker and Santorum. Rubio is Cuban and thus less Latino than Jeb Bush. The Republicans lose ideologically at the moment as also shown in this column. Less regulation, less taxation of the rich, worsening infrastructure and failing schools didn't work and these are things that the shrinking middle class is interested in. Bernie Sanders will never be elected by the whole country and he knows that. He is, however, a good differentiator for Hillary towards the left. Her wealth also means that Hillary will go fish deep in Republican waters. While she personally exudes "meh" , the clown car that is the Republican field and the fear for the liberal judges' seats in the SCOTUS will turn out liberal Democrats and centrists alike as the No-Democrat!- sentiment in the South has since the sixties.

What do the republicans want me to do without healthcare insurance that i can afford, use a credit card? Take out a second mortgage? Or do they think if they "create jobs" the onus is on  the employer to take care of the health and wellness of their employees? <br/><br/>So far Obamacare has helped my underemployed household tremendously with a monthly subsidized premium of $530 for a family of 4. Yes we have a high deductible so using an HSA, yes I pay separately for dental, no vision. It pretty much is just like the plan we had while employed full time 2 plus years ago! <br/><br/>I am so happy to be able to shop the exchange, comparing plans and researching insurance companies, confirming that across the board my doctors accept ALL the plans (and why wouldnt they?). NTL, I left BCBS and found a happier place with Priority Health. Would i like lower premiums SURE! is ti gonna happen, NEVER!

So a transgender man, who identifies himself as a woman eventhough he was born a man, is  perfoming a "mascarade"? Is she lying so society (God forbid!)? Isn't also a "privilege" to change one's gender? Yet society is more or less OK with transgender people eventhough we have NO idea --whatsoever-- about how does it feel to live in the "wrong" body. So why do all these intelectuals and experts in blackness and race, seem to know everything about how someone may feel about living in the wrong skin? If we are so willingly accepting that a man can become a woman because she now has breast implantas, blond hair, red slipstick, high heels and polished nails... (and because she physically has transforms into that "woman character", and she says she feels like a woman and she is a woman), then we MUST accept that someone should have the right to be recognized as black or as white or as whatever he or she REALLY feels on and under her or his skin!

Moderate? He can't wait to go to war!!! Clueless single minded human being.

You don't call the cancellation of millions of policies a mass cancellation?? those forced into high-premium, high-deductible ObamaCare would disagree.  You don't call record unemployment among blacks and record numbers of Americans out of the workforce job destruction??<br/><br/>The fact is, not one single benefit has come to pass:ER visits have exploded, healthcare costs are soaring, premiums are going through the roof (wait until you see next year's increases!), nobody got the $2500 Obama promised, state exchanges are failing left and right, and If you like your plan, you can't keep it!

I'm wondering - how could humans NOT be responsible for global warming? These "leaders/Repubs" are so far down the rabbit hole, I doubt they'll ever come up. Do they not have eyes? <br/><br/>I hope the Pope brings this up when he comes to visit Congress this year. I'd like to see some of these guys squirm in their seats, but that's probably asking too much.<br/><br/>It continues to astound me how in the dark they want to be and bring everyone with them. Quick! Back to the Dark Ages!

Should we be surprised that a man whose family has long been major shareholders in the ExxonMobil corporation is denying man-made climate change largely brought on by the use of ExxonMobil products?<br/><br/>Money is thicker than belief, oil is thicker than blood.  Jeb Bush and his ilk join the ranks of earlier numbskulls who denied the earth was round, only Bush &amp; Koch Bros. &amp; Co. are far more pernicious since they deny reality not out of some deluded philosophical notion but for pure, dirty profit.  Shame on these monsters!

Well, the last time something similar was asked during the 2012 Republican primaries, the moderator asked, "Should we let him die?"

Look at the facts, which of these Bozos is actually transparent?  The only one I can think of is Donald Trump.  Which one doesn't carry the stench of Washington DC everywhere they go, once again it's Donald Trump and don't forget that he's gotten things done that he said would get done; have any of the others?  I'd much rather bring on the clowns than continue watching the sorry state of individuals who professionally keep running for public office and due to the stupidity of the electorate keep getting reelected.  Where has that gotten us but over $17 Trillion in debt and no foreseeable way out.  We took a chance with the Half-Breed and that fell flat, so what do you want to do, give an old broad who has done nothing for the country or its people a crack at it?  The government stinks and needs a fresh breath of air.  Neither Democrat nor Republican offer that.<br/>Trump has to run as an Independent and let his proposed polices determain what he is.  He's got my vote!

Ellie, what have you been watching?  I just saw a FIERCE dragon rider, mythical snow creatures AND sorcery. Yes, the books are different, but to me, the biggest mistake was killing Jon Snow! All this time we have been awaisting answers about his life, and now? They killed him.  THAT is the reason I won't watch any longer. I will hope that Mr. Martin keeps JS alive (as the last book was not clear on whether or not he was dead), and he finds out who his mother is, etcetera. If not, I'll just burn the books I have thus far.

A lot of this is about "designer babies" -- want a baby from a healthy younger woman's eggs? BINGO! just shell out money. Want a baby who is tall, good looking and thin? BINGO! just pay for some sperm.<br/><br/>Don't want stretch marks or weight gain? BINGO! just sell out money for some unfortunate woman to gestate your pregnancy for you!<br/><br/>Do some reading about what happens when these families get an "undesirable baby" who does not meet expectations and isn't worth all the money they spent on having them.

"Home Prices Return to Sanity"?<br/><br/>And where might this be?<br/>New York, where mega $millions deals get announced almost every day, literally boggling the minds of writers and readers alike.  Haven't seen any home price "sanity" reported in NYC housing prices for years!  Or in other record high places like Boston, SF, San Diego...?  Or do you consider it to be "sanity" when a tiny, mediocre house costs north of $1 million almost anyplace desirable in the US or a NYC studio easily costs $500,000 to $2,000,000? " Sanity" to WHOM?  (Brokers, maybe)<br/><br/>"After an Era of Ups and Downs..."<br/><br/>Glad to learn that the recent era  has 'ups and downs"--prices have been pretty consistently rising for the last 2-5 years, and certainly in the last 1-2 years, in 'normal' housing, as well as skyrocketing mega $millions prices.  Article are written daily about the high costs of housing, people having to move, and children staying with families since they can't afford their own places.  (Perhaps you missed these?)<br/><br/>And your chart suggesting that worker salaries have kept pace with rents over the last 5 years--especially in the last 2-3 years--is simply belied by all the other data, and documented articles demonstrating that rents have FAR OUTPACED renters' (flat) incomes!  This is especially true in NYC (even with affordable housing rules not lapsing) but is widely documented elsewhere!<br/><br/>This sort of Panglossian view of housing just seems at complete variance with what everyone else is writing.

"Compromise isn't really a solution", and "[c]entrists are irrelevant"??? If you are correct our country has no future. It is a fact that we all hold different opinions about the issues of the day. Your thoughts are exactly what a democracy will always reject, by definition. I hold strong, and very informed opinions. But if I were refuse to listen to what others have to say I will become irrelevant, and our system will be more like a Vladimir Putin led dictatorship. Bah humbug!!!!

If conservatives value freedom so much, then why do they fight so hard to control women's reproductive rights?<br/>If conservatives had their way, 50% of the population wouldn't have the most basic right to maintain control over their own bodies.<br/>Conservatives are also primarily responsible for the disastrous 45 year drug war that has led to the highest incarceration rate in the world. (We're number one!)<br/>"Freedom", to a conservative, is a euphemism for eliminating the safety net and winner-take-all capitalism without regard for the common good.<br/>Everybody loves freedom, but conservative "freedom" is not for everyone.

Who / what is an African American??  Why is the President referred to as an African American?  Because he resembles his father more than his mother.  This issue is phony.  <br/><br/>If you can answer the question I posed above please do.  I consider the President an American.  Drop the African part of the label, Please!  Or come up with an answer.  I have been told I look Russian.  What does an American look like and why does anyone care?

You are criticizing her parents for setting the record straight? She (falsely, by all accounts) accused them of abusing her and her siblings! Their "motives" were to end her slanderous comments.<br/><br/>As far as the harm she may have done, I'm not black, so I'll take the word of many black posters who *have* said she has done them wrong.

Why not utilize paralegals? The profession was designed to make legal services more accessible. Paralegals perform substantive legal work at one-third of the cost of lawyers, and are a valuable, cost-effective addition to a legal team.<br/><br/>I have been a paralegal for 16 years, and work for an attorney with 38 years of experience. I have worked on civil and criminal matters in state, federal, and appellate courts, assisting in all aspects of cases, from the initial client interview to the final brief in the Court of Appeals.<br/><br/>I have stayed up all night to re-do a relatively new attorney's work in a separate statement of a motion for summary judgment; had my work product in a number of memorandums, briefs, timelines, and motions "borrowed" by attorneys (once in a jury trial!); and been asked by opposing counsels of large law firms to instruct them on how to e-file. <br/><br/>I know I work under my attorney's license, and defer to him when appropriate. I also respect him greatly.<br/><br/>However, I feel that paralegals are a resource that should be considered in any conversation about containing the costs of legal services.

Do you think you journalists could please stop mocking the concept of avoiding all wheat in the diet, aka "gluten free", by calling it "faddish"?  I've had three doctors over the past two years order me to cut wheat out of my diet; one is a general practitioner who works out of Mass Gen in Boston, another a Yale professor with a practice in Dermatology (apparently going GF improves one's eczema), and the last is an Endocrinologist.  None of these doctors are the hippy-dippy/hipster type, and all of them were right: cutting gluten from my diet has improved my health ten-fold.  I haven't seen my allergist in a year; I don't need him anymore!  He was the only one who didn't tell me to cut gluten out of my life.  Guess he liked having me as a patient, but I'm just as glad not to be lining his pockets any longer.

Apparently some people in the USA believe that the USA should adopt some type of socialist/communist big government like Russia (had) where everybody has a job working for the government, the government owns everything, and the government collects everything that the people produce, and then some politically appointed government elite bureaucrat doles out the food, shelter, and clothing to each of us as he deems to be required to sustain our lives according to that bureaucrat’s whim, desire, or other subjective criteria? <br/><br/>Under the socialist/communist forms of government, some citizens, mainly the non-producing greedy elite family connected government bureaucrats, usually determine that they are "More Equal" than other citizens such as the lower class citizens that make the things that the elite government bureaucrats (and the producers) consume, and should get more income than others that produce the necessities of life!<br/><br/>Most of the individuals in any communist USA would want to work at something other than producing the basic food, shelter, clothing that is required to sustain life, and then demand that the disgruntled producers produce more and more so that privileged individuals of the government elite bureaucratic society class can keep themselves busy as politicians, bureaucrats, police, firemen, judges, military, school teachers, and other endeavors that do not create any of the food, shelter and clothing necessary for maintaining the lives of the population.

Hillary has said, “Why do I have to keep proving to people that I am not a liar?!"<br/>(From the book "The Survivor," by John Harris) <br/><br/>Hillary Congenital Clinton Lies:<br/><br/>She “removed” a boatload of stuff from the White House and called it a clerical error, returning everything.<br/><br/>She didn’t know that her staff would fire the travel staff….after she told them to do so.<br/><br/>She lied about her missing billing records which “showed up” on their own.<br/><br/>She was “always” a Yankees Ball team fan when she was running for NY senator.<br/><br/>She lied as a member of the house judiciary committee.<br/><br/>She lied about flying into Bosnia under sniper fire but admitted to the falsehood later on.<br/><br/>She misrepresented her record opposing the Iraq war—when she actually voted for it.<br/><br/>She lied about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary.<br/><br/>She lied about the “uninsured” woman who died after childbirth.<br/><br/>Like we asked of Nixon;<br/>“Would you buy a used car from that woman?"

122760
Is President Obama black?? In fact, he's correctly designated a mulatto and so far as I know not one drop of "slave" blood in him.  <br/><br/>IMO Dolezal in a sense pointed out the total hypocrisy of so many of these designations.  I am not so sure that African blacks identify closely with the prevalent American black "agendas"!!

Anita, if HC is the Democratic nominee, just which Republican will you vote for instead? Too many Democrats are saying what you said, and unless Bernie can win the primaries and then the General Election we are toast. The entire government will be run by the crazies, both religious and economic, and social justice issues can go down the tube.<br/><br/>White, religious, anti-women, racist ignorant people will run the entire country. Anti science so thelanet can keep on dying, as can our young men being sent off to wR all the time. I thought I would never see this non-stop military zeal, but it is the way of the right. Military industrial complex has real negative meaning, for sure.<br/><br/>We are the No. One arms dealer in the world and now we are watching the crazies use our weapons against each other and our soldiers, too. Sad and pathetic, while we yap about whether people who love each other should marry. Why not, for heaven's sake?! The more love the better....

Which brave Republican will be the first to come forward to offer legislation to reverse the FCC's terrible anti-business theft in the form of a fee, and allow AT&amp;T to charge whatever they want and provide whatever suits them? I mean they are the job creators, right? <br/><br/>Sorry, "This brazen anti-business theft, and interference with an American citizen's God-given right to form a contract!" I didn't read the talking point memo clearly enough.

So wait, we're supposed to feel bad for you? That you failed? Did you hope that she'd say "Why yes you're right! I've never looked in a mirror before! A makeover will surely solve my problems!" and then at parties you'd be able to tell your colleagues about her with a tremble in your voice, "So then, she emerged from her dowdy chrysalis a glowing, confident creature, and I was there to help her on her way." No kudos for you. You did not do right by your client then, and you're not doing right by her now, writing this piece.

And how often do you see women shivering in shirtless blouses, knee-length skirts, and sockless shoes?<br/><br/>And the comparison is unacceptable, because studies have shown that women are judged more harshly on their appearance. Working as a hospitality specialist, my boss once told me "I see the look you're going for, but those pants? Let's not ever see those again." Can you imagine your boss saying that to a man? Ha!

"What if It Wins?"<br/>(i.e.the right-wing suit against ACA)<br/><br/>The the right-wing Repubs and anti-government zealots will have inflicted MASSIVE harm on the people of the USA, denying many citizens affordable healthcare, and they'll have to bear the brunt of citizen's fury for denying them healthcare.<br/><br/>And the Repubs will be clearly "on record" as acting against the best interests of the nation's citizens, at the behest of the special interests.<br/><br/>And they'll be utterly unmasked for having not put forward even the faitest FIG LEAF of a PRETENSE of an ALTERNATIVE to ACA!<br/><br/>But the main result will be more HARDSHIP for the American people, inflicted by right-wing zealots and millionaire Senators, Congressmen, and the likes of the Kochs<br/><br/>But as for "citizen's fury" at all the above, I'm talking about punishment in the polls in 2016... <br/><br/>But at some point fury boils over--cf. France 1789, Russia 1919.  Food and resource shortages, government waging ruinous war inflicting further hardship on its own nation (1919), a 'let them eat cake' mentality from Congress and the ruling class, and, at some tipping point...

Why do so many people blame the ACA for expensive, rising health care costs? When I retired at 62, before I could get Medicare many years ago, our family health care insurance cost us $12,000 a year. That was in 2003! What would have happened without the ACA is unclear, but ACA certainly shouldn't be held responsible for rising insurance premiums, which were rising at a rapid rate well before the ACA went into effect.

Why are we so obsessed about race?  Many people, especially in earlier generations, Anglicized their names to gain acceptance.  Professor Lewis Gates announced on his PBS show that to his surprise, he discovered that he had a white English male ancestor!  Stephen Colbert said that he decided on his way to enter North Western U. that he would tell people his last name was pronounced the French way (Coll bear).  He understood his ancestors were Irish when, in fact, research showed they were French and German!  My parents always said we were English, but I found I have Irish and Spanish ancestors as well.

And do the Palestinians bear any responsibility for their present circumstances? Apparently not!<br/><br/>I find it disingenuous to condemn the current conservative government of Israel for being too pro-national defense. If you study Israeli history, previous  leftist governments, such as those of David Ben Gurion, Levi Eshkol and Golda Meier, have been equally, if not more so, concerned with the nation's defense.

“Can Hillary Clinton Be a Woman of the People?”<br/><br/>No, no, and no!<br/><br/>Bernie Sanders has stood up for ordinary Americans since his days as mayor of Burlington. He is honest, articulate, intelligent and a fighter for a fair and more equitable society. As Sanders says, “The billionaire class can’t have it all.”<br/><br/>Sanders does not take corporate money and super PAC money, and will not appoint Wall Street cronies and corporate lobbyists.<br/><br/>Sanders will represent the 99%, seek the support of the American people to advance a progressive agenda, address climate change in a bold way, and if elected president, he will have a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees who will say, “We are going to overturn Citizens United because that decision is undermining American democracy. I do not believe that billionaires should be able to buy politicians.”<br/><br/>In 180 Seconds You Will Be Voting For Bernie Sanders<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ</a><br/><br/>Sanders: The problems we face did not come down from the heavens. They are made by bad human decisions, and good human decisions can change them.<br/><br/>More than 200,000 people have signed up to be part of the campaign. Join the political revolution.<br/><br/>Sanders on obstructionism: One of the first things that I would do as president, and what I am doing right now in this campaign, is to put together a strong, unprecedented grassroots movement which tells Congress that they've got to start representing ordinary people, and not just the people on top.

Nothing like fetishistizing the most utterly gratuitously wasteful vehicles you can find, right?  What an utterly inane, insanely narcissisticly wasteful culture we have!<br/><br/>First there were Cadillac boat-cars, then SUVs, then Hummers, now armored cars...  What's next?  Bradley Fighting Vehicles or Abrams tanks tooling around town?  <br/><br/>Think how much gas each of these vanity items wastes?  (And how this sort of waste pushes up demand, and prices!)  And think of all the gratuitous pollution each belches?

$40 billion?!?  Really?  Maybe he'd just like his own state, complete with 2 senators, for a fiefdom with all the residents for his very own serfs. I nominate Texas for this honor.  If any billionaires already there object, the serfs can choose sides and help them fight it out.

<br/>Has anyone used the word "unconscionable" yet? No? This is "unconscionable" of the Sony corporation! No wonder they have been going down hill for the past 20 years. I'm outraged. I'll never buy another Sony product as long as this continues. What am I supposed to tell my niece who is heart broken about her pet robot dog, Fluffy, which no longer moves at all? You would think Sony was a big, multi-national corporation, a huge, heartless enterprise only focused on their bottom line. Save Fluffy!<br/><br/>Fake outrage self-rating: 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Where is my award, my comment Oscar?

124302
SERIOUSLY?!  $100 Million? I guess they were trying to find the corporate equivalent of sending AT&amp;T to bed without dessert? I used to say all the time that something was going on -- I was paying for faster cable but didn't want their flipping U-Verse package and I swear, I suspected they were doing something like this.  (And my kids said I was crazy when you suggest stuff like this is going on -- HAH!)

Does this person deserve all this notoriety? Isn't enough that we have to listen to the egomaniaclal  diatribes of Donald Trump, the most vile Obama "denier"? There are far more important problems in this country and the world at large that need our attention and aid. To waste all of this news coverage on this "poser" is unforgiveable! Please, give it a rest......

She has a spray-on tan and jerri curls ala Rick James, so what? Yes, she embellished and lied on various applications and interviews but that’s not so unusual, is it? I don’t care about the lies or if she wants to “self-identify” as a polka-dotted zebra; the only real issue I see is the filing of false police reports. If true, she took scant police resources away from those who really need them and blatantly and shamefully wasted taxpayers’ monies. She should be prosecuted and, if found guilty, made to pay back every penny of the expense of the investigations and court costs. <br/><br/>Then they can hold a ticker-tape parade for her in downtown Spokane; she can sign autographs, pose for selfies, and sell her artwork - laughing all the way to the bank. You go, girl!

WHO'S TO BLAME?  I'm fed up with critics who dump on Obama for playing the hand he was dealt.  Dubya was the president who made plans to withdraw from Iraq by 2011 without a clear exit strategy that would provide defense against the civil war we are now witness to.  We can't have it both ways--to withdraw from Iraq and leave fighting troops on the ground is nobody's idea of ending a war.  But let's look at how the war in Iraq began!  It was based on a pack of lies.  No international coalition was built.  Dubya stood under a Mission Accomplished banner during a visit to a ship, taking a victory lap because he felt like it, not because we had won the war!  Though Saddam was a murderous dictator, Iraq was predictable.  Now it's chaotic, as is much of the Middle East.  Dubya's grand plan for bringing democracy to that part of the world turns out to be ephemeral, chimerical, nonexistent.  And we taxpayers are left footing the bill.  So before dumping on Obama, it's only fair to look at the mess that was dumped into his lap.  While he's been able to reverse the dire economic crisis, he's been less able to intervene effectively in the ongoing war in the Middle East.  Things could be much better there; but they could also be far worse!  I don't see that the writer of this piece or the Republicans are offering any more workable solutions, though.  Their aversion to governance has become their trademark, as has their armchair generaling.

Seriously, you think US foreign trade risks "undermining American sovereignty and making Americans subject to international courts"?

Biased? Are you stoned?! The Western media has long been telling the news in favor of israel until recently and that is because they can no longer hide the truth with so many outlets reporting the truth.<br/>Israel has long enjoyed being shielded by the West but no more.

Isn't Hamas deliberate targeting of Israeli civilian communities, in violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, also "collective punishment?" As the aggressors, Hamas may define the "Rules Of Engagement," but when those same "R.O.E." are applied against them, Hamas has no right to complain! See my comment about "Payback" above!

Can we please have an expose about Jeb Bush's involvement with the Project for a New American Century?<br/><br/>He was one of its founding members, along with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz (at least 10 members of GW Bush's administration.  <br/><br/>These people expressed their desire for "regime change" in Iraq on their web site as far back as 1997 and wrote about "world-wide command-and-control system" in the middle east.<br/><br/>Let's have an informed electorate this time around.  NY Times, it's time to redeem yourselves.  Haven't these PNAC scoundrels done ENOUGH damage? <br/><br/>This should be the campaign slogan for people with a sense of decency:  <br/><br/>"Jeb Bush - He can run, but he can't hide."<br/><br/>As a newspaper I'm begging you for some expositive writing on this subject and EXPOSE HIM!

OK, is this enough? Enough for our leaders to take the NRA to task and to really understand that we have created a culture based on fear instead of trust? Get the guns out of the hands of nuts, and work hard to bury the long standing vestiges of race hatred! We have choices in terms of what kind of society we want to live in and one of those choices is to not have a society that tolerates weapons in the way that we do. Murdering innocent people in a predominatly black house of worship (I'm not religious, BTW) re-inforces what we already know. As the walls of inequality break down over time, the vestiges of race hatred will go up in volume. We will find a narrative with this young man (and it's always a man, we have failed miserably in raising our boys to resist the testosterone driven need to destroy) that fits this reality. And it won't do a damn thing to help those whose families and community have been shattered. Let's see what the candidates for 2016 have to say about this. Not one of them has the guts to take on the NRA directly and that says it all.

It should not be a matter of wealth - - but if that is so, why was Romney attacked for his wealth so viciously? He was not a career politician. Nobody ever alleged any criminal wrong-doing on his part, indeed many people spoke glowingly of his charity and concern for his employees.<br/><br/>Why is it so totally evil and bad for a conservative to have wealth - but when it is a lefty liberal, then they get a TOTAL PASS on this?<br/><br/>My objection is not to the Clinton's wealth, but the suspicious way they came into it -- right after Bill left office -- most of it in the form of "gifts" and "bribes" -- not earned from any endeavor. Hillary got some huge payout on cattle investments, something she knew zero about and it sounded totally bogus -- a way to funnel her money for favors!<br/><br/>If a Republican did that, he'd be toast.

WHY ISN'T THE TIMES USING THE TERM "TERRORIST?!?!?!"<br/>Seemed an appropriate term in 2001.  I don't know how this differs, especially when the terrorist in this case told a survivor to tell everyone what happened...with the intent to TERRORIZE!  MEDIA, just because he's white does not mean that he should escape the "terrorist" moniker.  For shame, NY TIMES.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/9-11imagemap.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/9-11imagemap.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/9-11imagemap.html</a>

Why does such a young person have such a deranged mind ? Why his hate towards blacks ? I am not understanding this at all ! A christian nation but yet in some ways so hateful ??? My condolences to the families of the victims who peacefully sat in a place. Unbelievable !! It is home grown terrorism !!!

Where are this boy's siblings?  Had child protective services been involved in the past?  If so, why was this child left in a miserable situation.?  If not, why not?<br/><br/>Concerning the vicious cycle of poverty, I'm truly torn.  I believe the vast majority of poorer people would work their behinds off to improve their situation if given the chance and some guidance.  But I have also worked with the subgroup who are as committed to using the support systems as is any entrepreneur to his company's success.   Lest anyone assume a racial slur, my first experience with this was with the occasional white appalachian man who appeared in the house monthly to collect his portion of the welfare check and make certain every female (including his own granddaughters) was pregnant-- true story!   

126777
How about something much simpler?  Ms. Dolezal is a woman who has devoted her life to helping the black community, has done good work for that cause, and has a mental illness that leads her to want to identify even more strongly with the community she serves than truth can permit.  Surely we can understand not wanting constantly to feel like an outsider in the community in which one lives.<br/>There is nothing wrong with her choosing to serve the black community – obviously – and her need to be perceived as black herself – even as she ties herself in rhetorical knots to justify it – should illicit our sympathy and concern, not our scorn.<br/>Mr. Blow's response, by contrast, appears by turns angry, stingy and petulant.  What a shame!

126799
Then why don't you leave the country if you feel that strongly against it?  You complain about our government.  What about the governments of the countries the people are fleeing from??  Look at how these people live!  In filth!! And they have nothing.  What about their governments!!?  The people need to revolt - fight for their homes - their countries - their freedom!  Just like we did so many, many years ago.

126885
Why are Americans in denial time after time?  Leave guns to the deranged; the rest is history.  Every other measure is rhetorical and rings fatuous in the face of this tragedy.  Republicans as well as democrats, do something about this stupidity!

Andrew, What's your point?  If they had brought in a load of Martians for the building work, the responsibility for making sure the building and balcony were structurally sound would still ultimately lie with the building regulators of the state/ or country!  It doesn't matter a damn whether the builders were from America or not...while they too might be partially responsible - American or not - the regulator passed the building as sound...which it was not!

I'm really sick and tired (in just 5', I'm impatient like that) of this deluge of "well, yeah, the recognition of antropogenic climate change and the evils of capitalism and all that is OK, but the guy is evil for not pushing for more birth control" Really? like the reason people have the number of kids they have is because the Pope doesn't alllow them to use condoms and the pill... People, wake up! every society known on Earth has been using one or other method of birth control since the beginning of times, all the pill gave us is a bit more convenience and reliability. Now if you believe the drought in California (main cause of the water shortage) is caused by population increase and the CCP and its compulsory one child policy caused the stabilization of China's population (something already noted by Adam Smith in the XVIIIth century) you need to read a bit more about how the world works...

127283
The church hasn't advocated for large families in a very long time (the 1950s-maybe?). Most Catholics use birth control and Catholic birth rates are not particularly high across  the world.  What planet do you live on? Your information is about 70 years out of date!

Living in a country where unprovoked multiple murders is becoming routine, how does a 21 year old punk get his hands on an automatic weapon? It's impossible to avoid the cliche, "It's the guns, Stupid!". How about a strict liability tax on firearm makers; e.g., $10 million fine when one of their respective products is proven to be the gun used by these delusion and/or deranged people.

Where is your sympathies for sick adults and children in the US that find relief from their symptoms of their diseases by using medical marijuana where other drugs have failed? The medicine has saved the lives of children with intractable epilepsy, among many other diseases. How can anyone with a rational mind state that prohibition is feasible? It goes beyond any sane reasoning.<br/><br/>The only fool in this equation is yourself from what you've heartlessly espoused.<br/>When there are sick patients who find relief from marijuana, you would rather have them go without, even though they've tried the pharmaceutical route and discovered that those drugs don't work.<br/><br/>I get it; you don't have a shred of compassion for others who are sick. To those who do get it, we champion for the rights of patients to have safe legal access of medical marijuana for sick and dying patients. That's something you may not understand, but despite your archaic and lack of feelings toward your fellow human being, medical marijuana is the safest 'drug' known to man. It has never killed anyone; it has helped relieved the suffering of millions of people worldwide.<br/><br/>Medical marijuana is legal in 24 states and is something, despite this biased courts ruling, that will become law in all 50 states within the next few years, regardless of how you or they or others may negatively feel about its use. Get use to it; compassion is coming!

Am I literally the only person who knows what imputed rent is? The new york times never uses it in its "buy vs rent" calculations, so let me try to explain it very slowly. When you buy a house AND live in it, you are assuming two roles---the owner and the occupier. By living in the house, you are paying the opportunity cost of not renting it out to others, so in effect you pay rent to yourself! Now, that imputed rent is not taxable, so you save some money there, but still by living in your own home you are not saving the entire amount of the rent you would otherwise pay.

127642
Why is the New York Times glorifying what this man did by putting his photo on the website's front page for the world to see?!?  Congratulations New York Times, you just gave him his 15 minutes of fame.

Really, Phila? He had no parenting - how ignorant must one be to even think that! Of course he had parenting, and he didn't learn to hate in a vacuum. And this isn't a single deranged individual but a product of a hateful right-wing gun-loving culture in the South. Read a book or two!

Anyone remember Joe Wilson and his infamous quote  -"You Lie" ? Dont tell me this shooting wasnt about racism but by a poor misguided lone gunman! Since Nixon the repubs have run on racism, fed racism and rely on it. And so many of these who support this go to church every week

Where do th writers and editors of the New York Times come from, and what are you doing in my country? Americans do NOT treat our guests this way! To those from Ireland who are looking in, please do not imagine that the staff of the New York Times are Americans. They are from some other planet.<br/><br/>This non-Irish AMERICAN says R.I.P. to the dead, best wishes to the injured, and offers bottomless sympathy to the family and friends of the fallen. And to the New York Times, nothing but scorn and shame.

Infantile? Absolutely not! It's a shame that people don't respect other's personal space.<br/><br/>I was in line at a store the other day and someone was so close next to me I thought it was someone I knew creeping up to say hi.

Gee, who did Al Sharpton gun down?<br/><br/>I love how every time there is yet another one of these entirely too predictable mass killings, right wingers who push gun rights as if they were handed down from heaven immediately start screaming, "don't politicize this!"    It needs to be politicized and stopped. <br/><br/> Chris - would you agree to stringent gun controls if you knew that these killings would stop?<br/><br/>Yeah, didn't think so ....  Sad.

How did the human race manage to replicate itself when for the first 100,000 years, women had to look sexually attractive barefoot?<br/><br/>Hey! maybe it was a matriarchal society &amp; the burden of attractiveness was on men.<br/><br/>Now there's a thought!!

129505
Oh, we're still weighing in on this?! We were doing this in the late 1970's with platforms and stilettos! The fact of the matter remains this: Females look a lot hotter wearing such shoes! They know it and the book is still out on whether they are really bad for the feet and posture! And when wearing them, it's a fact they get more attention from men! And aside from the samctimonious ones, the overwhelming majority of women, crave the attention of men...It sort of helps validate them! And I'm the messenger, not the message!!!

I just have one question: As employed scientist or any other title professional women receive, why do you all use this word "baby bump?" It sounds either - juvenile or somehow- badge of vanity at times.<br/><br/>It used to be called a pregnant belly, which I find a bit more accurate. I guess if you wanted to sound scientific you could call it a pregnant abdomen or midsection.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a pop culture thing that I missed because I haven't watch television or movies for the past 10 years. Wait! I'll do an image search. Egads! Overload.<br/><br/> This is indeed foreign to me. Annie Leibovitz, Demi Moore and Vanity Fair- I question if this vanity is fair even to other childless women. Seems to be a big bump used as a big tool in the money making machine)<br/><br/>Additionally: we waste enough water on this planet producing fibers and fabrics and fashion as it is. Do we really need a maternity lab coat to be used for four months and then discarded?<br/>Wear an apron extension under the lab coat and use some elastic extensions on the buttons,<br/> or<br/>go to a low paid (dare I say, Immigrant) Dressmaker. She will open up the side seams, add a triangular piece of fabric. Four months later, she can take it out. She'll be glad for the 15 bucks she'll earn as a non-scientist domestic worker.

Racism is suppose to stop at the church door?The coverage is how could this happen in church? Lets stop our pollyanna reaction to anything distasteful. The racist is suppose to honor the borders of the church to hold his hatred at bay. The racist was suppose to know this was sacred ground? My thoughts are he did it because it was sacred ground. Both sides need to cut the rhetoric both sides need to reaffirm the value of everyones life.Time to cut the speeches and the playing to each others base. Time to play the the base called America!`

Exactly how high is the heel we are talking about?  From my heel days- there were kitten heels 9 1- 11/2 inch), usual (2- 2/12"), and the .. never mind. but one-was-supposed-to-sit 4" variety.   <br/><br/>I think the super high heels with or without platforms look silly esp. on the young uns who cannot balance.. and wonder WHERE IS WOMEN"S LIB? or why is it all about SEX SELLS?  <br/><br/>Brainless .

"A more perfect union?" Give me a break! Yes, there has been change over time, but even when slavery and the slave trade were at their height many whites understood what they were doing was wrong--they just chose to rationalize their actions so they could make money. We today are no smarter, no wiser, and no less anxious to rationalize discrimatory practices; the recent events in Ferguson, Staten Island, and Baltimore are proof of that. The problem now is that despite all the marching, fighting and dying, people STILL don't want to really look at this nation's past. They crave a feel-good narrative that says the sins of this nation are all "antique" and in the past. The gaps in historical understanding I see in high school and college seniors terrify me, because their instructors prefer a neat package with no loose ends. In 1898 we helped the freedom fighters of the Philippines overthrow colonial Spain, but we don't want to deal with U.S. repression of the Philippines afterwards, which was only supplanted by the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. We marvel at the endless conflicts in the Middle East, but no one teaches that after World War I we were right there with the British and the French carving up the Ottoman Empire--and thereby inventing "the Middle East" ourselves--for our own interests. The old scripts have not changed--we've just gotten better at duping ourselves.

RE GFAGAN: What does the late Ian Paisley have to do with the killings in Charleston? That's like blaming Corregidor on Japanese Americans interned in this country during the Second World War. And while we are on the subject of hatemongers during the "troubles" in Northern Ireland decades ago, what about Martin Mcguinness, Gerry Adams and their entourage of IRA gunmen and bombers whose murderous actions took the lives of so many innocents from both communities. Do they have clean hands?I would not think so!

We need more rules, John Howard? To prevent others from doing something you somehow declare to be unethical and unnecessary and (hah!) "way too expensive?" It's not easy to see where you are coming from, but it's easy to see where you are going.

I can't help but wonder, What does it say about masculinity in America that, just before opening fire, Dylann Roof said, "you rape our women"?  Something about his sense of his manhood seems to have been at stake, for him (i.e., psychologically).  Surely the number of black women raped by white men far exceeds the number of white women raped by black.  <br/><br/>What would it look like if white women joined with black women--and with Hispanic women, Asian women, and Native American women--in setting the record straight about who has been doing most of the raping around here?!  <br/><br/>Time somebody did.

Are several of the savagely critical commenters above confirming the stereotype of sports fans as not-too-bright?  Does it really have to be spelled out that the intent of this article is humorous, that the writer is immensely impressed by Mr. Curry's basketball talent, and that this is a playful homage to him?  (If you don't know what an "homage" is, you can look it up in a dictionary!)

@Richard Luettgen from NJ<br/>A perfect pitch rendition of the right's standard response to those who confront them with reality:  "Hey, what's wrong with optimism?  At least we have a goal!  A little old fashioned moxie and amazing things can happen."<br/><br/>Selling desperate people the impossible and/or wildly improbable magical solutions isn't optimism, it is exploitation.  Those who engage in this behavior aren't leaders, they are con-men.

Is it going to happen again? YES! Was it a hate crime ? YES, YES! Was a gun involved ? YES, YES. Was the killer mentally deranged? NO! ( unless his lawyers make it out to be. ) Does Gov. Haley really mean what she has said? For the moment, YES! But is she going to take any remedial measures to prevent such a tragedy from happening? NO! The deflection to the question asked of her belies her intention, what all her poetic words cannot camouflage. Very sad state of affairs indeed! Just shows how we as civilized people have regressed.

James, did it ever occur to you to read widely and compare viewpoints, for instance, highly respectable outlets like the Economist and the Financial Times? <br/><br/>For a balanced assessment of the situation see recently:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21654598-greece-and-euro-zone-are-stuck-abusive-relationship-my-big-fat-greek-divorce" title="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21654598-greece-and-euro-zone-are-stuck-abusive-relationship-my-big-fat-greek-divorce" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21654598-greece-and-euro-zone-are-...</a><br/><br/>And did it ever occur to you that 18 European nations (of which Germany is only one) and the ECB and the IMF may have a few good points as well?<br/><br/>Of course not, because the good professor is guilty of what he is accusing his opponents of: incessant moralizing and cherry picking. Reading this column, one could walk away with the impression that everyone but the Neo-Marxists of Syriza are block-headed, narrow-minded, neo-liberal ideologues. Get real and READ!

Is it Terrorism?  Is it Racism?  Is it Anti-Religionism?  As Hillary Clinton so succinctly put it, relative to Benghazi, "...what difference does it make!"<br/><br/>Arguing over what to call this vicious act deflects from addressing the urgent issue in this country of easy access to guns by disturbed people.  We are not taking guns away from people, we want to keep them out of the hands of people who might possibly cause this heart-breaking devastation to the lives of others. Weeping and moaning is hypocritical.  We are enablers when we stand by and allow these horrors to occur over and over again. <br/><br/>It is time for back-ground checks when applying for a gun license.

What else can we expect from a man who marks his name with an exclamation mark? Here's a man who responds to the Papal encyclical on climate change by saying that he(!) prefers to worship for personal improvement rather that actually acting on the worldly moral challenges raised by spiritual reflection on the practical meaning of Catholicism.<br/><br/>Ah, Jeb! Give him comfort but hold the challenges, please! Such folks are little more than free-loading passengers on the Popemobile.

 Lindsay Graham: "You know, how do you go back and reconstruct America?"<br/><br/>The flag that your political cohorts are flying over their state house validates and encourages young racists, senator. But equally outrageous is your infuriatingly blasé attitude toward this criminal provocation. You, sir, are an utter disgrace!

133594
Wasn't the Doonsbury GW Bush  * ?  Then it's perfect that Jeb would be !.  Two parts of a cartoon expletive.<br/><br/>Based on the trajectory of our nation it seems that some of the wealthiest among us want a country more along the lines of Argentina.  Let the rabble battle and kill one another in the streets while the top tier dine on fine beef and watch the fray from their castle redoubts.  In the absence of a spirited response from the Dems I'm beginning to think the best prospect for the presidency is Pope Francis.  At least he seems to understand that the insatiable demand for growth at any cost is the root of most of our problems.  You can't spend your way out of bankruptcy... or can you?

133661
 where to start, where to start? Unbelievably insensitive comments by two men that do not deserve to be called Americans. Lindsey Graham, a so-called presidential candidate, should be putting a piece of tape on his mouth. In addition he should spend his time trying to get something done in Congress instead of making asinine statements that just proves he is clearly not presidential material. The other guy...well what are you expect?  let's just all bring guns everywhere and shoot the place up. We're bound to get some bad guys. Ridiculous!

Apologies?  Reparations?   To whom? From whom?  My family was poor and lived in Ireland during the famine.  Why should I apologize? <br/><br/>My family came here after slavery ended. No one in my family owned a slave.   We were more likely to be indentured.  As everyone should know, indentured servants were usually treated worse than slaves, because slaves were property, whereas there was incentives to "use up" the indentured servants before the contract expired.  <br/><br/>The other side of my family is from Slovakia.  The word "slave" comes from the word "slav" because in the 9th century many slavs were reduced to slavery after an ancient conquest.  Therefore, I am likely the descendant of slaves.  Why should my claims based on 9th century ancestors be any less important than someone else's 17th and 18th century ancestors?  I suffer greatly thinking about what my people endured.  Perhaps you are a descendant of those who enslaved my ancestors!<br/><br/>Penalizing companies whose charters were granted hundreds of years ago is foolish.  The past owners sold their stock many years ago and took the money. If we're going to ignore statutes of limitations, we might as well do so to find the heirs of the real people who were responsible.  <br/><br/>While you are at it, why not check criminal records for the last 300 years to find out who committed crimes of any kind, and ask the descendants to apologize and make payments to the heirs of the victims.

Why not just restrict the number of properties, in a single city, that a person can rent out on AirBNB?<br/>I rent out a room in my house on AirBNB sometimes, but if AirBNB didn't exist, in no way would I rent out the room longer-term. I'm not looking for a roommate--especially since that guest bedroom is often occupied by family or friends!

Why is climate change a political issue? Democrats have embraced the role of human behavior and Republicans have denounced the Science. Democratic politicians thus accept the conclusions of the Climate Scientists, and the Republicans have used Science as a political club. I am astounded by the degree that the Republican political system has exploited an anti-science, anti-intellectual bias that must pervade our electorate. I can only guess that many of those who call themselves "Conservative" harbor these anti-science biases either because of religious reasons, lack of education or self consciousness about their lack of knowledge and understanding. It will be up to the Republicans to make this right. In the meantime, Go Pope!

So, what is going on now in the mind of this miscreant Dylann Roof?   Is he experiencing pangs of guilt, shame and regret?<br/><br/>Although I am neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist, I would guess with a high level of confidence…that he now has a great sense of relief and exhilaration.  No guilt, no shame, no regrets.  If anything, he is basking and wallowing in all the attention and notoriety being given to him.  An "adrenaline rush", if you will.  Before he committed this heinous act he was just a frustrated and directionless NOBODY…without a girlfriend, to boot!<br/><br/>In his warped, pathetic mind he is now a “somebody” who will be remembered…at least as a footnote…for time in memoriam.  He will now face the consequences for his heinous act without seeing the light of day at least until the year 2100, i.e., if he lives that long.  The worst punishment  that we as a society can mete upon him now would be to ignore him altogether.

Maybe I've missed it, but has any adult come forward with the least bit of family responsibility or pity for this twisted kid killer? Or did he just spawn up from that swamp with his Rhodesian &amp; Afrikaner patches on his jacket? Was he suckled by gators or does he have a mother and a father? This must be your native son, South Carolina! States Rights, States Rights, you've been mouthing States Rights for 150 years. What kind of State do you have that lets a kid drop out of 9th grade, and 8 years later he's sleeping in a car, drugged-out and homeless but with a gun that he got despite two arrests in less than 6 months. Ah yes, the Right to bear arms, you gave him that. States rights, states rights. And now that this human accident has happened you want to kill him before he's even brought before a judge. I guess that's a States Right, too.

Seriously?  She was 49 years old!  It's not like she was 90 and an invalid.<br/>I hardly see the saving of her young life as an "opportunity lost."

"Or is it guilt by nationality? All Americans today are guilty of slavery? If that is the case please state the country or nationality that didn't tolerate or promote slavery in its history?"<br/><br/>1. Yes, it is guilt by nationality, and yes, we Americans do 'own' what America has done even before we were born.  When you belong to a nation you get its good and its bad in one bundle and you don't get to pick and choose.<br/><br/>2. "But everybody else did it too!" Seriously, you think that's relevant here?

134929
Where does the idea come from over the last couple of decades that the Civil War was fought over slavery? The North was profiteering just as much or more than the South!<br/>Do you think that the Union soldiers were going to battle to free the black man. History gets twisted depending who is running the lede....

(cont) Why are we here? Why weren’t we born into different circumstances, or in another time or place? What is the purpose of living, - why make the effort and endure the vicissitudes of life? Is this a question to be answered by the hedonist, or the ascetic? Shakespeare asks-Why not opt out? Yes we can choose to endure and perhaps influence the course of our lives or we can …shuffle off this mortal coil. Hamlet’s answer to this strictly human conundrum is No!<br/>…the dread of something after death,<br/>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br/>No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br/>And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br/>Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all…<br/>Kurt Cobain, 9-11, Adam Lanza, et al are all too familiar tragic names to today’s teens. Shakespeare had Hamlet spend much of his play pondering and only when the Prince choose life was he able to act. It may be many years before our graduates discover the “who” about themselves, and even then who they are will constantly go under change. The foundation our youth needs to build upon is the why-the purpose to their lives. Find that and they will find themselves.

OK - ban all guns - then what? The cat is already out of the bag - how do you intend to round up the millions of guns already out there?  Racism is already out of the bag - and guns are never going away - that is the reality - yes it is a horrible reality, but one that must be dealt with - so the question becomes how to prevent this from happening again? These events happen in places that are easily targeted.  If someone was armed in that church or that school or that mall etc, maybe these cowards would think twice before attacking.  The 9/11 attackers (since we are now considering him a terrorist) were cowards - they flew planes into buildings - easy target - how do we deal with them? Well, again a horrible reality - but with the REQUIRED opposing force.  It is not a popular idea, but a reality based idea - not a UTOPIAN idea.  BE aware of your surroundings! Why is this white kid in my church right now? I am not going to assume he is here to do evil, but I may just be a bit suspicious and consider all possible outcomes.  Again, is this a great way to have to live everyday? - no - not in a Utopian society - but this is NOT and Never has been a Utopian world - these are the facts of the world today - time to deal with them - and banning guns at this point is futile.

135148
So where are the white dads these days?  So many young white males committing mass shootings, and no talk of where the dads are, and what their proper roll in the lives of theirs sons should be.  Until we reexamine the home-lives of these boys, we shouldn't first point the finger at external reasons for their violent behavior.  White dads, take some responsibility for your offspring!

135159
We need mire guns in "sitting duck" zones? And people will only be antagonized if sane regulation and control were enacted? Ask the people in Charleston if they would be "antagonized" by regulation? You might find, that as with 90% of Americans, that background checks at loophole centers, such as gun shows are in fact supported! Who is it again that is behind, and out of step with America? The anti-gun lobby, the NRA, was always the correct answer to that question.

Hello moderation ( Prof K, you there?), is it verboten to remind you US folks of your very own Greek crisis, that's almost missing from the media? Puerto Rico? Don't point fingers at us Germans, prove that you're doing a better job on your very own territory, first! There's US citizens desperately waiting for help.

135185
What, we worry? Not at all! The highly inefficient Greek system will unavoidably fail to deliver the same standard of living as the Northern ones, especially under that economically incompetent "radical left" government (quote: "the PUBLIC sector is the primary one"). The Greeks may fool themselves with nominal numbers under their free falling New Drachma, but in PPP adjusted reality, they'll simply stumble along. Not a glowing example for others at all. The Spanish, Portuguese and Irish people will see the difference and know they made the better choice!

 Are you censoring me? You didn't bother posting my comments yesterday.  And my comment was sound. I disagree with the mainstream media's take on this. It's as if you are saying: Here's another juicy opportunity to talk about White Supremacy and terrorism against blacks. When we had 20 or so 5 and 6 year-olds being gunned down, no one called it: Hatred of Children and Teachers. When we had the Aurora Movie theater massacre, it was not Hatred of Movie-goers. When it was college students, we didn't see: Hatred of Collegiate Elites. But the Media gets the double whammy and rolls up their sleeves with this one and goes into all these discussions on White Supremacy and Confederate flags. This kid, this pathetic, mentally ill young man is just another variant on what has become an all too common theme-- especially here in the U.S.  There are a slew of video games that feature the lone killer mowing down innocents. No media gets into this subject. Nor is there really anything on the day to day shootings and killings among youth--many of them black--in the inner cities. No media really cares about that...but this is payday for the you guys--race and killings, and it happened in the south. Wonderful! The other aspect that is so hideous here is that this kid spoke of this to others and none of them reported it to the authorities as a warning and a potential threat. Not one of these kids did that. God bless these evolved souls who forgive this hideous act. Now censor me.

Dear NYT writers: stop trying to influence the public into "forgiving" or letting bygones be bygones by publishing stories about an Andrew Lack (who cares except insiders?) and sympathetic dispatches. We get it, you like him, you like him!<br/>I won't believe Williams again about anything. Tear drops, sweat, anguish,  "torture" aside - the fact that he is willing to crawl back to TV points to trouble ahead. How can he ever be taken seriously as a reporter again? He's a face who reads teleprompters and when he finally hit it big with a story, it was the one about him making up stories.<br/>Had Lester Holt done the same outrageous thing, who believes that Holt would have been given any chance at returning?<br/>Tragically, at the network, they are still pouring over the audience numbers for the interview to justify putting Williams back on the air. But the exces don't realize that most viewers who watched the interview also enjoy "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," "Survivor" and the like.<br/>Here's a news tip for NBC: A lot of  journalists have lost their jobs over the years. There are a bunch of smart broadcast journalist who beam charisma and inspires confidence (including people of color and older women!) who could contribute to NBC or MSNBC and help it begin a new chapter.

Please consider this, this ???!!? had hatred for the black race and the white race. His goal was to cause a race war, I don't know how many whites or black signed up for war but he didn't mind massive death of any color. He is a narcissistic, to him people are collateral damage as long as he accomplish his goal  "of separation". He didn't care who died, metaphorically people like this is pollution to the ecosystem all of  us would suffer.

135963
Why would you advocate for honoring the traitorous soldiers who fought to destroy their own country? That wasn't valor, it was ignorance (just like now). The descendants of those soldiers should be ASHAMED and embarrassed, not proud! The solution that preserves the Union: never allowing the confederate flag to be flown anywhere within the borders of the USA.

136124
How would we feel if Germans flew the red and black swastika in honor of their 'heritage' and the many 'brave' Germans who fought and died for it?<br/><br/>And what exactly is that Confederate heritage?  South Carolina made it very explicit when it passed its articles of secession, which are easily available to read for yourself online in case you have any doubt.  The 'heritage' in question was and is, the subjugation through violence and chains and the enslavement of human beings who happened to have a different skin color and different geographical origins from European-Americans.<br/><br/>Is this what you neo-confederates are so proud of?  How is this different from the same ideology that ran Nazi Germany?  They also preached a gospel of inferior and superior races, of enslavement of 'lesser' peoples. <br/><br/>At least modern Germans are ashamed and humiliated by the horrific behavior of their ancestors.  So ashamed, that the display of Nazi regalia is illegal in Germany today.  It flourishes here instead!<br/><br/>Just as the US Army marched into South Carolina and tore down that vile racist rag of the 'stars and bars' and marched into Germany and tore down that vile racist rag of the swastika, perhaps it is time to do the same once again.<br/><br/>Lets propose a constitutional amendment, call it the healing amendment, that prohibits the display of Confederate regalia or monuments, in the memory of the millions of slaves who were tortured, raped and died at the hands of the 'glorious' Confederate ancestors.

Now who is it that says people are not working because they get unemployment  insurance, and would rather live on that instead of having a job? Now we  are being told, people are not working because they get medical care!<br/><br/>I do not recall ever meeting anyone who did not want a job because they got some kind of government aid. As things are going these days, employers are cutting out employer paid health plans and defined benefit pensions as it is. <br/><br/>It is more likely employers would hire people who are healthy because they have the ACA. People who have to take sick leave cost money, healthy employees are far more productive. I would question this study, and wonder where they got its data, or from whom they got the data. It sure looks suspicious to me.

What is his explanation? He seems to want it both ways.  Was it all  unwitting befuddlement?  Innocent  "mix ups"  stemming from  pitiable  insecurity?  Did his actions emanate  from a bad place called ego or vanity, resulting  in an intentional  desire  to appear better and more important i.e. lies.? Unfortunately, despite  his oft-mentioned clarity,  torturous  unpacking &amp;  ownership,  Brian's aha moment appeared to be his realization that because he "was already IN"  the stories he was covering , his 'embellishments' were unnecessary. (!!!)   There's the crux of it. All I can think of  is Albert Brooks' &amp; Broadcast News.

So the kool-aid drinkers are on board? Great! Problem solved then!<br/><br/>Sorry, but I think debunking religion - like combating climate change - is one of the chief tasks of our time. Thinking that because you believe what you believe you deserve eternal life and those who do not do not is not moral. Thinking that the creator of the universe - if such exists - could discriminate between people on that basis is evil. The religious are therefore revealed as secretly selfish, spiteful people who should really read a lot more "other" books to become more intellectually mature - or as victims in need of saving. The religious reader can decide for themselves what they are.<br/><br/>"Evil can best hide not in darkness but in a light that blinds." - GRW<br/><br/>Religions are blinding lights! They are much more part of the problem than a solution to the problem in my opinion.

POLEAX a day after ICEAXE? PAH? Balderdash!  In fact,  there were quite a few dash clues! SOTTO vocce I knew from SNL's OperaMan. I thought *i*was imaginary when I saw the clue for ROOT of -1. It was more than PENNY ANTE, for sure. AERO was a bit of a start because I saw (and I am not making this up or making a joke) that the shooting suspect was returned to SC from NC in an "aeroplane." (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33190735)" title="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33190735)" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33190735)</a> OTOH, it was good to see my favorite calculus answer (HOUSEBOAT), which is what you get when you integrate d (cabin)/cabin. . . many think you get "log cabin" but don't forget the C (sea).

i think the only lasting solution to the world's problems would be to offer the 168(?) countries of the world statehood. two senators for each and representatives proportional to their populations. we have tried so hard to control the world. we bomb whoever we want to bomb. we invade again whoever  displeases us. but we seemingly can't do it well enough for everybody's pleasure. i really see statehood as the only truly viable option that would cure all  our dissident writers well wishes. although the armament industry would certainly lobby against the proposal and could you blame them? no more wars!

Are you sure that "do(ing) something" like switching as rapidly as possible to renewable energy will be "at the expense of economic growth"?  I suspect the next great fortunes will accrue to those who capitalize on the limitless wealth of energy the sun pours on the earth every moment of the day and the winds that are always blowing somewhere among other non-polluting sources of fuel for our societies.  Why  the Koch brothers aren't manufacturing cheap solar panels and bladeless windmills is beyond my understanding.  There's the future of the 0.001%!

How about having as national theme- "How kids turn out everywhere determines everything?" NYT's highly respected Op-Ed writer, Nicholas Kristof, published this on his blog Jan. 5, 2014, a response I gave to his request to many for themes, but not a new concept! This concept, which NO ONE can dispute, can be enabled if EVERY policy, organization, religion, educational facility, etc. is REQUIRED to determine its effect on kids before continuing or new implementation is permitted!<br/>    We might get this started by having a wide range of media  (maybe even on programs like Jeopardy)  initiate discussion for contests ( with some sort of incentives) where everyone is urged to compare two topics &amp; show how they are connected, such as if you are in a good school district you are more likely to learn, but also show that even then if you come from a very dysfunctional family, you will more likely do poorly.  The comparisons should progress to seemingly unrelated topics, such as "What difference does it make to a child if some CEOs make double-triple digit millions a year"?  Lots of hot button issues could be discussed- environmental degradation, excess incarceration, court-ordered abusive custody, abuse of/by legal system, student loans, cost of ANYTHING where its costs exceed the overall inflation rate BUT re that show not only direct costs (such as for health care) but how ignoring them causes new costs re unemployment, how various abuses result in stress- well known cause of illness,

The most appalling comment I heard (was it from Lindsay Graham?) framed this as being about religious persecution—someone who had wanted to attack "Christians". <br/><br/>How bizarrely false can you get? Has he no shame?!

So here's my question:  If polling has so many problems (and I agree it does) then how do we really verify our votes?  Wouldn't it become much easier for someone to fudge results without it being questioned?  I remember in the 2004 election all the Diebold machines were owned by the Lt. Governor of Ohio, a Republican!  How do we confirm an accurate count of a vote?  <br/><br/>Great Britain's recent election was way off.  How do we know the final vote could be trusted?

137640
Anyone know?<br/><br/>Not at all - but i wouldn't want to run it as an experiment - as actually the Euro would keep on being the 'real' currency.<br/>And that's the thing - which seems to be so hard to understand for a lot of commenters?<br/>We are (still) talking about complete economical chaos - where also most of the so called data policies should be based on could be misleading. And this is not a value judgement - as I basically like these type of chaotic economical concepts. BUT you have to be very - very creative and good in improvising to work with such a system. <br/><br/>You just can't master it the 'academic' way! 

137697
Why do you find the assertion of racism inflammatory?  The remainder of your post chillingly reveals the answer: because the assertion (and the supporting maps) are all too true!<br/><br/>What motivates someone of the racial majority in America to call for grotesque, draconian policies which will drastically reduce the population of all the racial minorities in America? You may be fooling yourself with an air of  intellectualism, but your suggestions are all too familiar to any student of history.<br/><br/>How would you "end illegal immigration"?  Mass deportations, concentrations camps, Vernichtungslageren? <br/><br/>How would you enforce a one-child policy in America, the Land of the Free?  Would rich and poor be treated equally under this law, or would it again come down to "All pigs are equal, but some are more equal than others"?<br/><br/>Unwittingly or not, you are promoting a totalitarian dictatorship based upon race. We can only hope such extreme views will remain a distinct minority.

What percent of the population of the southern states are descendants of slaves?  Do they consider themselves "southerners"?  Do "white" southerners actually consider the "black"  southerners to be southerners?  The slaves built the south, kept the white south afloat, after all--are the white southerners suffering from some kind of virulent amnesia?   If the current residents of the southern states who are descendant of the slaves do not feel pride upon seeing the confederate flag gracing their state institutions, the confederate flag cannot logically be called a symbol of southern pride.  That an academic cannot recognize this simple and logical conclusion is distressing.<br/>White people--wake up!  The confederate flag is a symbol of violence and oppression to people who don't look like you...good lord, why can't you see this?

138131
Who is "white" in the country? Do you know? No you don't! Looking at the color of the skin of a specific person does not determine if that person is "white." We need to stop using the concept of "race," created in the 18-Century as means of classifying people. We would do better to return to the age-old classification of nationality. The ancient Greeks knew that skin color was of little use as a means of classifying and relating to individuals who looked different from you. <br/><br/>Of course, the "West" has glorified "white" skin color as the determinant of intelligence, goodness, social standing. The best kept secret in the US and the rest of the "white" world is that when you are hungry, homeless, stateless, your skin color does not matter.

138231
Remove it?<br/><br/>Heck no.  As an act of continuing contrition, fly it upside down.<br/><br/>But what profiles in courage these Republican candidates are, each showing that he is qualified to be POTUS because he can make the tough calls in a timely fashion!

Is'nt comparing the swastika and the Confederate flag comparing apples to apples? Don't the Germans want to distance themselves from their ancestors because of the evil perpetrated by them? So why do  these people want to be associated with the Confederate flag of their ancestors, a flag representative of the evil of the era? And the wily politicians are disgusting as usual. Nine horrendous murders in a Church! Even that does move them.They skulk away from the real issue in fear of losing votes. Wish they had an ounce of principles. They shift the onus onto South Carolina without losing face, knowing full well the outcome. Give South Carolina time to debate the issue. But what is there to debate?  Debate to keep a symbol of evil? As for time - how much more time is needed? Another century?

Obviously you have never seen a video on how they torture these poor creatures before death?  Some cut off their feet, some are skinned and boiled alive, some have their limbs dislocated and tied behind their backs for hours or days before being brutally slaughtered.  They think that excruciating pain makes the meat better.  Before you make comments like this, go watch a vid.  You will not sleep for weeks, you will cry yourself to sleep, your mental anguish will torment you......sure slaughterhouses are sickening but never to the degree of the dog and cat slaughterhouses.   Dogs know what's coming and it's horrible to see the terror in their eyes......................someone's pet!!!

"Republicans Tread Carefully in Criticism of Confederate Flag"?<br/><br/>"Tread Carefully"?<br/><br/>Why report this Republican double-speak as if there's ANY validity to their (in)action?<br/><br/>Huckabee, Cruz, and co. basically advocate DOING NOTHING (yet again!) in the face of appalling gun violence and overt racism!<br/><br/>The same old "hear no evil, see no evil..." NRA-dictated mantra!<br/><br/>Appalling and sickening!  And demonstrating an utter lack of principal or a backbone in the face of murder!

a " few lobbed useless rockets"?!<br/>Have you seen the damage of those rockets?<br/>Imagine somebody lobbing a few useless grenades into your living room. You of course would not call the police and will not fight back; you would sit back until the peaceful person lobbing "a few" (actually several THOUSAND) grenades into your house decided to stop.<br/>The rockets were much much more destructive than grenades.<br/>Note too that Hamas continues to declare that its goal is to totally destroy Israel, to throw all the Jews out and to murder all Jews everywhere.<br/>But, Israel is the bad guy.

Hamas kidnaps and murders 3 teenagers going home after school but *Netanyahu* "intentionally provoked" "the militants"?!<br/>1. Hamas launched rockets and declared it to the world, every single day.<br/>2. Other terror groups also launched rockets.<br/>3. Does it matter which groups launch hundreds of rockets into your country, daily?

"A war on black people? This is unhinged hyperbole, and it is inflammatory and irresponsible commentary."<br/><br/>Roof stated to one person that he wanted "to start a race war," and he said to the victims that he had to kill them because black people "raped our women," etc.  What is this about it not being a "war on black people?"  It is the traditional argument of all terrorists:  You are not like us, so you have to die.  UGH!

Why does humanity never learn (let alone, heed) the lessons of history? Lest we think these are "fringe" groups that pose no threat to humanity, the lessons of the early 20th Century are before us as examples. In the early 1930s, the Nazi Party in Germany was considered a "fringe" movement at the margins of German society. All it took was some economic pain, which may come to exist today, given the debt crisis in Europe, the aggressive politics of Russia and China, and who knows? What was a "fringe" movement all of the sudden becomes very valid and attractive alternatives. The rhetoric of hate can be very seductive, since the idea is to assign blame for certain problems to a racially, ethnically, or culturally identifiable minority group. It's certainly easier than actually dealing with the actual problems. That appeals to our baser instincts of self-preservation (of our egos, at the very least). All these hate groups, be they racial or religious, foreign or domestic, must be taken seriously and treated as a very real threat. Otherwise, whereas the 20th Century marched mankind right up the edge of total destruction, but because of the advancement of the destructive power of man, a war of global magnitude will most likely see our actual demise in the 21st Century ... not just whites, blacks, whatever, but ALL of us!

I have one question for our writers:  in a world which has become dominated by the oligarchs, where transnational corporations appear to have more power than nations and can practically buy governments, how does this white supremacist ideology flourish?  Is it that white supremacism somehow assists in the feudalization of workers and the poor?<br/><br/>Somehow there is a connection, a dangerous one.  Between the power of capitalism and the terrorism of white supremacy.<br/><br/>Persons of good will abound on this earth.  But moneyed interests must be allied with ideologies of suppression - for them to flourish.<br/><br/>Unless we get this right our earth is doomed as a place to support life.  We can die from pollution and its consequences.  Or from hatred and its consequences.  Or even from both.<br/><br/>God help us!

Why do the white supremacists feel it necessary to tell everyone that they are superior except that down deep inside they apparently realize that far from being superior they are actually run of the mill human beings if not actually inferior themselves?  Going around trying to put down non-whites in an effort to make yourself feel like somebody who is superior because he or she was born with a particular skin color is a pretty childish game that only someone who is not too bright could make themselves believe.  Where are the Lindsey Grahams and other South Carolina leaders when they should be educating their followers that the Civil War should be left to history and not kept alive by bigots with a need for kidding themselves.  There are probably just as many inferior whites as there are inferiors of any other skin color so let us wake up all those still trying to live in slave days and bring them into the 21st century with freedom for all.  How about speaking out for the democratic equality we all want Lindsey Graham and other South Carolina and southern state leaders!  It's certainly about time to hear you stand up for all our citizens.

and what counterproductive manouvers? - as counterproductive and destructive as the crazy up and downs of teh market - and milions and millions lost in the real Greek economy - as tourists tried to stay away from the Greek Casino and went (again) - for countries where gamblers don't run the show. <br/><br/>BUT perhaps and hopefully - finally the result of the learning process: NO gambling in Europe anymore - Back to European compromises and working out conflicts as usual -(AGAIN!)

What does Crimea have to do with oil and gas?  Nothing!<br/>While a case could be made that Crimea has a natural link with Russia, a military take-over is not the way to do this, nor does it mean that Russia should control the government of Ukraine, which clearly wanted to separate from the Soviet Union when it did so in 1990.  See the excellent Wikipedia article at:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Ukraine" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Ukraine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Ukraine</a><br/>Russia has been using their supply of oil and gas to Ukraine and Europe as a lever to control of Ukraine and reduce any response from Europe (since they sell natural gas to Germany).  BTW, the US is now the world's largest producer of oil and gas, although it is mainly consumed domestically, in part due to Congressional restrictions on exporting oil.

You do realize that you will NEVER confiscate ALL guns from ordinary citizens right? THE ONLY people that you will confiscate guns from are the legal gun owners.<br/><br/>Criminals WILL ALWAYS find a way to obtain guns. How are you going to stop that? Go into the ghetto or trailer park and knock door to door and search every little cranny of every room in every apartment/trailer? <br/><br/>Don't be ridiculous! What you will do is prevent people from being able to  protect their homes/themselves from intruders making them vulnerable to murder/rape/robbery, etc etc..<br/><br/>I don't get people with your mentality. There are thousands of stabbings each year and yet you people don't make a stink about knife laws…It's like you are so brainwashed into thinking that taking guns away will create this rosy little world with people holding hands skipping around singing kumbaya.<br/><br/>THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. there will always be criminals, rapists, murderers. Not everyone's brain is wired to be compassionate or to have empathy, therefore you will never stop the violence.

Teresa, do you work for no compensation?  That is what advisors are being asked to do.  If a young person comes to an advisor and says that he or she has only $500 to invest each year in an IRA, there are mutual funds or ETFs which would be excellent.  The investor is charged a commission, which is not much. Client is happy, FA can survive. If FAs can charge only a fee which is .75%...you do the math.  It is a myth tha Financial Advisors have "cost" investors so much money.  In my 27 years in this business, I have led my clients to a retirement the couldn't even imagine on their own.  I suspect that, should you carefully examine Congressmen's campaign contributions one would find that their bank accounts have been fed by many of our largest retirement plan companies such as TIAA-CEF, Fidelity and Vanguard, who have recently realized that as the Boomers were retiring, they were moving their retirement monies to advisory firms which really do try to do the very best job possible.  But, no, not for free.  The little investors will be left to "robo advisors". God help them the next time there is a market crash!

@ SJS  " Why is it that every time there is an article criticizing (and rightly so) a group, somebody has to pipe up and cry "why didn't you mention blank, blank, and blank?". "<br/><br/>Exactly!

     This week in the New York Times the article that interested me the most was, "Should Hope Solo's Actions Keep Her Off the Field?".  This happens to interest me the most, because I am a huge fan of soccer.  I have been playing soccer ever since I was 4, and I am a HUGE fan of the US Women's Soccer Team.  I personally think Hope Solo is, by far, one of the most amazing goalies in women soccer history.  Although I am a fan of hers and think she is a great goalie on the field, I am not a fan of the actions she has taken off the field.  In the past she had absolutely no business in assaulting two relatives of hers, and now I see that she has been showing combative behavior to police officers?!  Hope Solo is living out her dream by being a professional soccer goalie, but it will all be gone due to a few unnecessary actions.  I feel that Solo should not be suspended from the Women's World Cup games, but should be fined for the actions she took.

Could someone please explain why Republicans need to be so sensitive to the flying of a flag that represented the Confederacy, which the Republicans mounted a war to undo? <br/><br/>It is clear that this "issue" is important to a key constituency of the Republican Party, for unstated reasons. Those unstated reasons are becoming hard to ignore, and they are NOT about honoring the war dead!

So right-leaning, pro-life Catholics are turned off by the "sanctimonious trendiness" of environmentalists? Is there anyone more sanctimonious than a right wing pro-life Catholic? And speaking of sanctimony, we're talking a papal encyclical here! There is nothing more sanctimonious. It's dripping in sanctity, supposedly. Personally, as an atheist, I can't stand people pretending to speak for God, even when, as in this case, they largely agree with me.<br/><br/>Perhaps what Ms. Carroll means by "sanctimonious" is that environmentalists consider theirs a moral cause and make a moral appeal for action, as does the Pope in this encyclical. Perhaps her right-leaning pro-life Catholic friends consider themselves to have a monopoly on morality, and resent it when others presume to prevail on them with moral urgency.<br/><br/>As for trendiness, openness to new insights has never been conservative Catholics' strong suit. Denigrating it must be emotionally satisfying as well as defensively effective.

How many years has she been governor? If she really thought that flag should have been removed she should have done it years ago, not when the national spotlight is on her. Shameless political hack!!!!

"But they should also look at themselves and take responsibility for a style of life and behavior especially of their young people and ask what has happened to us?"<br/>There are a set of unspoken assumptions here -- that "those people" engage in a certain "style of life and behavior" -- but our writer doesn't say what that style of life and behavior is. I think he thinks we already know, because "we all know how those people act." What kind of statement is that to make? Shall we make the same statement about "those white people?" <br/><br/>I am appalled that someone could write this and not realize just how racist it is!

Bloviana, you're worried about "mixed gender in bathrooms"?  The worst thing that could possibly happen impends, huh?  Nature is uprooted and stars fall from the sky and boys and girls use the same bathroom!!!  <br/><br/>What will the Union victories look like, you ask, when all this happens?  They will look like victories of the northern army in 1861-1864, effectively ending the moral atrocity of slavery in our land, just like they look now.  And the hysterics of people who wish to have the good ol' slavery days back will eventually die out and the snows of time cover them over for good.  And I do mean for good.

So it's OK to use guns and kill someone as long as they're not church-goers or<br/>elementary school kids?  Nonsense and even if he was a demented racist, it was the gun that made it all possible.  Ban the darn things.... BAN ALL GUNS!

142918
Why are we celebrating? It took a mass murder to wake up the powers that be in SC that its racist heritage is embarrassing. It is 2015!  Not 1870. The change is being made for political purposes. Sorry, but anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. 

143059
Really?!? I'm amused. Why not guns? A flag, no matter how dastardly, kills people. I agree, take down that flag! But Nation, do something about something that really matters--guns!

<br/>"Everybody has asked the question, and they learned to ask it early of the abolitionists, 'What should we do with the Negro ?’ I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are worm-eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall. . . . And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs!"<br/>—Frederick Douglass (born a slave) stated in 1865<br/><br/>"It is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercise of these privileges."<br/>—Booker T. Washington, born a slave, quoting Douglas

I am in no way slamming you Terry, but can you see by the number of "recommends" you have on this comment, how out of touch you are about this? Nobody wishes to dishonor anyone,especially deceased American veterans, even if they were traitors to the United States of America of the time. Plain and simple sir, the times have changed and the symbol that you are so proud of is a dismal reminder of some of the darkest times in American history. It creates hate just by being flown and that is a fact! We aren't hiding it away, we are putting it to rest, where things like that belong.The last step in this procedure is to get the few last proud southerners to see the light. You can still be very proud of the South and lose the symbol of racism and hate that is connected with her. I personally would love to see the South rise again...to be first in wiping out racism in our country. I wish your state in particular would make great strides in that and other more modern directions.<br/><br/>And one last point sir: It isn't just "catering to a few," or "a hard reminder for some African Americans." The Confederate flag offends me personally as well, and I KNOW that I speak for many other white people when I say that it offends them too. Symbols of hate and racism hurt the HUMAN RACE my friend, and we all need to get on board with this.

<br/>Are we all PETA? <br/><br/>They never repudiated what their founder Ingrid Newkirk said a number of years back, "A boy is a pig is a dog."<br/><br/>Steve Kane Show (WIOD-AM Radio Miami, FL) question to PETA Outreach Coordinator Susan Rich: "If you were aboard a lifeboat with a baby and a dog, and the boat capsized, which would you rescue?" Rich's answer: "I wouldn't know for sure...I might choose the human baby or I might choose the dog."<br/><br/>In a WSJ, “Close Encounters of the Primate Kind,” Robin Kawakami writes about how a gorilla named by his guide as Kalembezi almost jumped on him. Then he writes about the baby gorilla, Kaunga, who mugged for the cameras.<br/><br/>In “Elephant Company” by Lt. Col. James Howard Williams, about Elephants role in World War II he referred to them as “my babies” and created a the blueprint of gentle training for his “elephant school.” <br/><br/>His wife Susan Rowland, once “pardoned” two ducks making them pets instead of dinner.<br/><br/>By equating humans with animals you are reducing the spirituality of the human soul and anthropomorphizing animals. <br/><br/>Perhaps we have absorbed the Disney culture to avoiding facing our own mortality.<br/><br/>Stop trying to make monkeys out of us!

Noticed how ridiculous the tittle of this piece sounds ?<br/> " America´s Second Chance in Guatemala "<br/>America¨s  ???  You mean the US.   America is not a country ; not a nation,<br/>It does not seat at the UN; has never won a cup in international sports, etc<br/>it is a continent and, if you didn´t know ( which I wouldn't be surprised )<br/>Guatemala is IN America.  So please be more precise in your aggressive<br/>reporting. ( ie,  America DID NOT invade Iraq, it was a the US !!! )

"What part of Christians loving the sinner, yet hating the sin is so hard for people to understand? " <br/><br/>Defining practicing homosexuality as a sin is the part that's "hard for people to understand". Really, you're just trying to make yourself feel better in a hair-splitting way. You want to feel that you are a loving person who loves "even" those who sin (how very big of you - really, give yourself a hand) but you also want to maintain the moral high ground of being very clear that they are SINNERS - and you are NOT a sinner - at least not for THAT (ewww!) particular sin.<br/><br/>What you want to exhibit and what you want other folks to accept is your "tolerance" of LGBT people - yes, they are sinners, but you tolerate them because even sinners may repent and come to God. But tolerance is not acceptance and what is being asked for by Christ, if I may be so bold, is more than tolerance of our fellow persons. It is to accept them and love them as they are and homosexuality is very much a part of who they are just as, I suspect, heterosexuality is very much a part of who you are and, assuming that you are heterosexual, I very much doubt that you consider it a "choice".

143432
Also, why do you all speak of starting with easy fixes and small gestures?  We have been dealing with this issue for hundreds of years!!  The time for easy fixes and small gestures is past gone.  I want no part of them, and I don't want to wait until we're ready to move on to "the heavy stuff."  We need to start with the heavy stuff, and the flag will follow.  You remove one symbol, they will cling to another one, I guarantee you.  It's the hate and the racism that needs to change - taking down a flag will accomplish very little, if anything, except perhaps making liberals feel better while the racists regroup.

It takes the cold-hearted, calculated murder of 9 people to FINALLY bring this to her attention?!  Something's rotten in South Carolina, and it didn't start with Fort Sumter; watch the movie "1776" and you'll see the problem was there from the VERY beginning of our country.

Wish of the two is more capable of inflicting pain and death ? There are no equal armies and the justice is not balanced , Who is the oppressor  and how willing is it to bring peace to the region ? How many of the oppressors friends are looking the other way ? U.N. viewing things from a different point of view is echoing what  V.I.P. has been seeing and commenting on for a long time . The denial mode of  some  must  be seen as a warning  for peace sake !

A book titled "In Search of the SIberian Klondite" published 1902 about a geologist/banker/ photographer going to Siberia and taking photos of the natives page 44 is a photo of the village street-- what is missing?  there is no garbage anywhere!  There was no paper or plastic! Animals and plants that were the food were eating totally for several meals into soups etc.<br/><br/> We need regulations on packaging and reusing packages and bottles etc.

Remember the good old days when if a company wanted their people trained in new methods they provided the training to the current employees?<br/>Any company planning on using the H-1 Visa program should not have them issued until they sign a no-layoffs waiver.<br/>In my 30 year working career it's pretty easy to trace the decline of the worker's rights and compensations in favor of "the business model."  I believe it started when we allowed "personnel" departments to be renamed "human resources."  Because just like natural resources, humans are consumed at an alarming high rate without regard to the future impact on the world without having to remember they're a person!

What use is economic "progress" if we destroy our planet? What use is it getting richer in China or India when you can't breath in it's cities. What use is it becoming an economic superpower like California and having no water. The Pope is pointing out these realities and you and many of the Times writers are looking for wiggle room so as to keep your capitalist baby alive, fact is we can't survive if she does. Just because you are comfortable within this system does not mean the system is right, we are adults and part of growing up is changing and embracing change...The Pope is asking us to change our ways! As a grown up, you have to seriously consider the challenge and reflect on the profound words in the Encyclical rather than holding on to old tired and dangerous ways.

144418
What about 'excuse me', as in "Excuse me, would you mind turning your radio down?"   'Excuse me' or 'pardon me' are perfectly natural and accepted ways to get another person's attention, certainly more polite than 'hey, you!', and don't utilize the apologetic 'sorry'.     

144428
But, like in the parable of the good samaritan when they ask Jesus" who is my neighbor?", we must also ask "who is rich?"<br/><br/>Anyone living in the 1st or 2nd world is certainly without a doubt, rich.  We have water, food, transportation, varied types of work according to our skills.<br/>Some have more comfortable lives but ALL are RICH beyond measure according to the standards of first century Palestine, when Jesus spoke.<br/>So I guess that means the entire USA is never getting to heaven. Even poor  "poor" are offered phones, food stamps and basic housing. Deprivation? Certainly! ( compared to the NYTimes reader.)  But comfortable compared to what Jesus knew of the poor of that time.  <br/><br/>So be careful how you throw Jesus's words around. The rich he talks about are YOU.

David, can you not even consider your potential grandchildren and great grandchildren?  All the generations to follow, as the Torah teaches you?<br/><br/>And if the world were to follow your lead instead of the Pope's....  And when all the streams and even brooks are polluted...  Then your progeny would carry a last name meaning "Filth"!<br/><br/>Is that truly what you want to pass on as their inheritance?  Filthy/Brooks - that's what you're advocating?

So I guess it would be acceptable for Germans in Germany to honor their forbearers by flying the Nazi flag?  What's good for the goose is good for the little ole Quacker.   Wake up dummy!  The flag represents the same thing the Nazi flag does, racial hatred, inequality and intolerance.  Time to give the stupid arguments a rest. Better yet, lets fly the KKK flag.  Same as the stars and bars.

So, imagine you're lying in bed at night and your daughter is being held by ISIS, potentially being tortured and/or raped on a regular basis, how ya gonna feel? <br/><br/>Rather than bullying the world (i.e., Iraq invasion) why doesn't the U.S. invest in peace, education, and development. Want to stop a terrorist before they become a terrorist...SHOW THEM A BETTER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT LIFE !!! GIVE THEM A BETTER ALTERNATIVE.<br/><br/>It can be done.

For what, exactly, do we constantly need to apologize? I fully understand the value of the "assertive apology" and see that it's more polite than, in the noisy neighbor example, saying what you really think and feel at that hour. (I've been though this myself, and have caught myself saying, "I'm sorry to bother you, but could you please turn down the TV?" I am the bother!?! Anyway.)<br/><br/>Years ago, I knew a young woman who apologized for everything. EVERYTHING. Her boyfriend got a new job that paid quite a bit? She was sorry. She lost some weight? She was sorry. Why? Why not celebrate these things? It's OK, and it's not a slight against someone else when we have a success. <br/><br/>What is interesting is the apology - or rather, the "I'm sorry" - when we need to convey dissatisfaction. It's become a knee-jerk, filler sort of phrase. When we are truly sorry, when we need to apologize, the language is more clear and direct and meaningful. When I am sorry, whether it be a remorseful apology or an expression of sympathy, there is nuanced language to use. When I don't want dirty lettuce, I am going to be conscientious about not saying I am sorry about it. We have a right to satisfaction without having to be sorry for asking.

This type of incencerity is akin to asking "how are you?" all across North America. Those who ask the question don't mean any more than those who ask it.<br/><br/>I'm not North American, though I lived here half my life; hence I respectfully answer by asking if they really want the answer to that question; or, I warn the interrogator that it's going to be a very long answer if they really care to get an answer to the question, etc, etc. <br/><br/>In a variety of ways, I refuse to give a meaningless answer to a meaningless question. Two wrongs don't make a right.<br/><br/>The other thing I could never wrap my mind around was "You look great!" expecting a "thank you' as a polite reply. I don't see why I'd thank anybody for a comment on my looks or my dog's appearance. ("What a cute dog!" I tell everyone very seriously that it's genetic, whether it's whatever combination of genes in my dog's physical appearance or mine because neither one of us has any contribution to the way we look. It's the way our parents produced us; why would that demand praise, congratulations, or a thanks in either of these cases? <br/><br/>The other answer, reserved for men who want a reward on their unrequited comments is "Ask me how I feel," which stumps them all and shuts them up without any other meaningless comment. (I identify as female.)

Who do they think is going to buy all their plastic crap and pay their gigantic entry fees when no one in the nation has a job left that pays a decent wage? Hey, winners, what are you going to do now? Make sure you boycott Disney!

Oh, haven't you heard?  This bill will benefit all Americans!  How do I know?  Well, read the post by Mr. Szabo of Greenwich Financial Management.

He promises!<br/>Also, I must sadly announce that I need to sell the Golden Gate Bridge.  Are you interested?

After each of the continuing series of gun related massacres, I have often asked, "where is the NRA? No comment from them? How surprising! Are they hiding their heads in the sand, for good reason, like the proverbial ostrich?" After reading Cotton's comments, the NRA is best served by keeping it's collective mouth shut at times like this. Just wondering, but when are the "Nervous Nellies" who populate both halls of Congress going to stand up on their hind legs and pass legislation that will protect all Americans from guns and the NRA? The answer is probably never, but I can hope, can't I?

I guess that, being a  Christian (Catholic? I do not know) yourself, you just can't stand the fact that the biggest Christian religious and moral authority in the entire world has come down condemning selfishness, as he should.  You should know, from reading the Gospel, that that is exactly what Jesus did. And most of the policies supported by Republicans (against health care, against raises in minimum wage, against fairer taxes, against recognising the science of human-induced climate change, etc...etc..) are against the teachings of the Gospel, which are teachings against selfishness.  It was about time that a Pope would denounce the way of thinking espoused by Republicans (but, believe me, he does not care about Republicans per se)!  Where are you going to hide now?  So, now you are all trying to discredit this Pope.  Shame on you! Now you, the Republicans, who have always used religion as a tool to promote your falsely Christian policies to put other people and political parties down have nowhere to hide, because this Pope just denounced your disguise (even though this was not his goal).  The policies espoused by the Republican party, policies of unfettered greed, are not Christian, certain not Catholic!!! It was about time a Pope would clarify this issue.  The Catholic Church of St. Francis of Assisi cannot support the likes of the Pseudo-Catholic Republicans trying to use Religion to their personal advantage and to advance policies that put working people down.

Nathan - I'm interested in hearing how it's possible to end illegal, unnecessary wars when the voters, alone, had the chance to dump Bush in 2004, but instead kept him on? If it was a matter of insanity, what possible hope is there for this country if the voters continually go insane at all the worst possible moments?<br/><br/>As far as the money part, the voters did not object to the 10-year tax cut plan that handed the keys of the kingdom to the wealthy by insuring that only those wealthy could become even more wealthy. Insanity.<br/><br/>Everyone wants to know who the enemy is, when the enemy is... us!

Can you imagine FDR allowing families of US POWs  to pay ransoms to the Germans to get their boys back? And I don't mean prisoner exchanges, which are something else entirely, but money put in Nazi coffers for the safe return of soldiers (or journalists, diplomats or anyone else, for that matter). Helping the Nazis to strengthen their war machine with an infusion of dollars? Unthinkable! It would have been considered counter-productive to our own interests and to the interest of all Europeans, as well as to the well being of most of the world's population.

Consider removing this flag from the Capitol grounds? Just what is there to consider?  I’ve learned in the past week that this flag was put up in the early 1960s as a response to the Civil Rights Movement and desegregation. It stands for hatred not Southern heritage. There is no need to consider this! This flag should never have been put up. It needs to be taken down now to honor the victims of this hatred. <br/><br/>In addition, Walmart will no longer sell symbols of the Confederacy. Why has this company been profiting from these for so long? They didn’t know what they meant? Really? I didn’t know that this chain sold this garbage. This just adds to my list of reasons for not shopping there. <br/><br/>I can’t help wondering just how many more deaths it will take to make this business and others realize that profiting from gun sales is unethical.

If we want to eradicate world hunger, I think it's best to have an open mind about protein. So what if another country puts dog on their menu. Our "American" problem is our cultural ethnocentricity- what's good for us is good for the rest of the world, and when we see other cultures eating dog, we'll they may as well be eating Lassie or Old Yeller.  <br/><br/>In 2015, American's spent $60 billion dollars on pets/food/health /day care/spas/clothes and toys. I think that type of opulent spending behavior on a dog is a heck of a lot stranger than eating one. For crying out load- we don't even call them "dogs" anymore! They are now Emotional Support Animals!

Is the supreme leader's comments a surprise to anyone with common sense?<br/><br/>He is not "positioning" he is telling negotiators to bring a lot of change of clothes on their trip - a trip of fools.<br/><br/>This is the man with the last word and he comes from a short line of Iranian leaders (one) who only know how to think like they are in the 8th century.....his way or no way!<br/><br/>The clock ticks while Israeli/Gulf Arab states attack plans on Iranian facilities are honed and Iranian scientist inch closer to to their destiny of making the region a hot bed of nuclear weapons

"HAPPYish" for USWWC? <br/><br/>A 2 : 0 win puts USA in the 'elite 8',<br/>&amp; a date w/China.<br/>ÓLE, ÓLE, ÓLE !<br/><br/>The truth of the matter is that last night's match was an ugly affair, on multiple levels.<br/><br/>Officiating:<br/>French "Ref" wasted little time giving yellow cards to US standouts Holiday &amp; Rapinoe :(<br/><br/>2nd Half:<br/>Barring a missed PK, the US were in a great situation, namely;<br/>a) An extra player advantage, &amp;<br/>b) COL w/a 3rd string keeper<br/><br/>From this point forward, USA had COL on their heels, and before you knew it, it was 2 : Nil.<br/>Defense was stellar, as always.<br/>That's all good.<br/><br/>After USA scored it's 2nd goal, things went sideways !  Specifically, play at midfield &amp; the upper third of the pitch became  amateurish at best. Sloppy play &amp; turnovers became the norm ... Vs a team of 10.<br/><br/>Commentary:<br/>Towards game's end, Fox commentator's advanced their theories vis-a-vis, the "need for creativity" going forward. <br/><br/>Excuse me? ... "Creativity"?<br/>Hello, why don't we address the basics of passing, possession, &amp; turnover reduction beforehand? <br/><br/>Let's go USA !

People keep asking:  once the confederate flag is Eli instead from government buildings, from a state flag, from stores and license plates, then what?<br/><br/>1.  Keep up the pressure till the Confederate flags on public property are gone.<br/><br/>2.  Next a campaign to rollback voter suppression laws and enact voting reforms:  voting holidays, especially for national office;  early voting; voting by mail; easier registration; short lines at all polling places' etc.  ALL of these are civil rights issues.  Vote suppression is another form of racism, so it has to go!<br/><br/>3.  VOTE!  The racist, terrorist murders of nine prayerful people meeting on hallowed ground MUST not be forgotten or have been in vain.  Make their martyrdom matter on every Election Day.  They can no longer vote.  Make sure you do!  Make sure 9 others vote too!<br/><br/>4.  Once we regain and expand voting rights and End Vote Suppression, then we may be in better shape to tackle gun control.  Make the goals clear.  <br/><br/>5.  Keep up the pressure.  Boycott if necessary.  Keep your eye on the ball.  <br/><br/>6.  Make sure we are inclusive.  Every step of the way.<br/><br/>Some of us are old, like myself.  But among the nine who died, one was  87.  The youngest who died was 26.  Our black brothers and sisters must not have died in vain.

Would we allow the public display of any other traitorous flags in any of our State Capitols? Why should this one be an exception? We would never tolerate the public display of the flags of the Third Reich, the Islamic State, North Korea, or others of that ilk on the grounds of any State Capitol!!<br/><br/>Here is a suggestion for the Governor and State Legislature of South Carolina: If you want to honor the military heritage of South Carolinians, replace that flag with the following five flags, those of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Coast Guard. South Carolinians, not to mention citizens of the other 49 states, proudly serve their country as members of those services, whose flags merit public display on the grounds of any State Capitol!

Southern heritage?!?  The people who marched and fought under the Stars and Bars were traitors.  Only by the graces (reluctantly granted) of Andrew Johnson's grant of amnesty were these terrorists allowed to regain their citizenship.  The fraud of southern heritage needs to identified for what it truly is - politically acceptable terms for racial disharmony and a refusal to accept that their ancestors' treason was defeated.

You're trying to say that's causal?  Ridiculous!  I'd point to the famous correlation that a lack of pirates causes global warming...<br/><br/>Here's one reason life expectancy has risen dramatically:  medical advances.  Here's another:  improved sanitation.

Who says men can't multitask?  Granted, a woman probably would have caught the ball while feeding the baby and texting someone, using that mysterious third hand that they seem to have.  But this couldn't have happened anywhere but at a baseball game.  !Viva beisbol!

How can the USA ever possibility restart our basic industries (re-industrialize) to re-create the US jobs that the “Free Trade Agreements,” MFNs, and the PNTRs destroyed in the last twenty plus years? <br/><br/>Will that re-industrialization generate a positive balance of foreign trade to restore our economy, create privately owned wealth available for the government to confiscate a part to pay for government services and preserve the buying value of the US Dollar?<br/><br/>After the American Revolution, extremely high import tariffs were originally proposed by Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to help protect and create new American industries. <br/><br/>The US congress then instituted (extremely) high import tariffs to encourage the industrialization of the USA, and it was successful in establishing a positive balance of trade, accumulating Gold reserves, creating a manufacturing base in the USA, creating a human technical data base, and then making the USA independent from England for technology. <br/><br/>Those gentlemen were apparently much more intelligent than the last few US presidents and other elected politicians of today!<br/><br/>We must stop exchanging title to everything of value that is privately owned in America as required to get US dollars back from industrious foreigners in foreign countries to pay for our US government payrolls, government contracts and other government services, plus pay for the things that we import with US dollars paid to foreigners.

So if there have been no "successful" lawsuits yet for harms caused to kids from puberty blockers, it's full speed ahead? This is like someone arguing in the mid-20th century that we should keep using Thalidomide, electric shock treatments, lobotomies, or insulin shock treatments because there hadn't yet been a successful lawsuit! And we are talking about children here. We should be even more cautious about administering off-label drugs to our youth. The fact is, all these kids are part of a grand experiment with no data behind it. There is, in fact, some data on these drugs being used on children with precocious puberty, and the news is not good; here is one article on blockers causing polycystic ovaries. <a href="http://www.eje-online.org/content/163/1/55.full" title="http://www.eje-online.org/content/163/1/55.full" target="_blank">http://www.eje-online.org/content/163/1/55.full</a><br/>In addition, there is data on the ill effects of steroids (testosterone) on female athletes. But the young women currently being dosed with testosterone? Another uncontrolled experiment. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/31/1193618974100.html" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/31/1193618974100.html" target="_blank">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/31/1193618974100.html</a>

"when so much of the world is embroiled in violent conflict?"<br/><br/>I don't know.  I am now 78 and I have yet to see a person being killed, a woman beaten by her husband or a woman raped.<br/><br/>Of course these things happen, they are deplorable and we should try to have less of them.  (But remember always that "zero tolerance" leads to overcrowded prisons and destroyed lives of the "perps").<br/><br/>But bad things are rare.  As someone pointed out, if we had a flight of 200 chimps going from NYC to LA, when the flight landed, there would be several chimps severely bitten, one or two had their arms torn off.  By contrast 200 humans can travel from NY to LA without any of these things.<br/><br/>Of course we are perfectionists and can make a fuss if by accident someone is served peanuts.   But in reality we behave pretty well, which is why there are so many of us and so few of other hominids.  We take care of cats and dogs and cows and even other humans, more or less.<br/><br/>There IS a problem, and it should be solved, but there is no reason why Homo Sapiens needs to cry a huge "Mea Culpa!"

"This is about money, money for the military contractors who make those "battle tanks" and Dog nose what else as we ramp up another bogus conflict (do we CARE what happens to Ukraine?? Let Germany worry about it!) to enrich our war profiteers."<br/><br/>Wow, and I thought Obama was Commander in Chief who decided how our military and hardware is deployed.

150055
No mention of Gorbachev? He was the reason that the Cold War evolved. Not cocka-doodle-doo Ray-Gun telling him to "Tear down this wall!", as if that would have mattered in the least without him. Since then the world has continued to evolve in inevitable multi centric fashion and Putin struggles to find relevance, while the Chinese are laughing all the way to the bank with our "adventures" in the muddle East with primitive tribes fighting over their particular version of imaginary deities from the first millennium.

"But insisting on replacing them immediately would create impossible challenges for the food industry" <br/><br/>?!?<br/><br/>Scientific research has indicated the serious health risk of transfats since 1956. It became a top concern of dieticians more than 30 years ago. And only now is the government acting to protect the population from what is essentially a poison in our food. Most likely tens if not hundreds of thousands of people have suffered premature deaths due to transfat. You possess a very odd notion of the meaning of the word "immediately"

150207
Starve the "poor"? More like starve the export markets, to which so much of the Central Valley's products are going. That's what rankles most - middle-class schlubs like me are being lectured about our showering habits and forced into seeing our property values lowered as our lawn goes brown so that rice can be exported to China. To China! Why can't China grow its own rice, using its own water?

150377
What happened recently in Baltimore?  In Ferguson?<br/>When the poor rise up they get shot and arrested.<br/>And when they try to get together in unions, the party of the wealthy passes so-called "right to work" laws.<br/>And when they try to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge they get jammed into paddy wagons.<br/>There's an awful lot of power on the other side.  Blame that!

Since when is FIFA God? If artificial turf is unavoidable (why?), and it needs "filler" (why?), something more friendly must be found. It is absolutely unacceptable that women are denied the natural turf provided for men! It seems to me - an avid fan and watcher of women's soccer on TV - that there have been many more falls on this surface than on grass as well.

White supremacists have taken over WIsconsin? Gee, you learn something every day on the NYT! (NOT).

A surprise? No. Those of us who read other news sources outside of the mainstream media have known this for a very long time. Because most of our media is now owned by right-leaning corporations, they're loathe to report extreme right-wing violence. You'd certainly never hear about it on Fox News! Here's hoping this is a step toward realizing the real threat is at home.

Was the murderer white? where the churchgoers black? If not, then it does not fit this narrative. Sorry!

Bob Jones University's policy was to expel students that married outside their race?  Wow!  Really?  Seriously?  And the University was arguing to maintain this policy until it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1983, not 1883?  Wow again.  Disgusting.

150942
I simply cannot wrap my head around this:<br/>Why are religious institutions allowed to be tax exempt? Separation of church and state means that the government will neither prohibit nor support the business of religion and that religion will not interfere with the government. By allowing such businesses to be tax-exempt, the government is supporting them!<br/><br/>Tax their donations as revenue and disallow charitable giving as an income deduction. You should give because you want to and you feel passionate about the cause, regardless of that impacts your tax liability.

150994
Who "supplies" rain fall, snow melt, river water?  No one "owns" the aquifer.  No one.  Farmers haven't paid for the extensive system of reclamation districts, levees, canals, dredging, reservoirs, dams, etc, etc, etc.  Their "rights" are only granted by legal precedence.   South state development interests already buy northern ag land just for the water rights to be literally sold down the river.  This system is broken.  A new consensus is needed, and magical markets are not the answer!

What part of 38+ Million people living in a desert does no one understand?   I mean really!!!! We hear about over population from the LEFT all the time but when it comes to the places they live, they do not see it.

"What white people are really asking for when they demand forgiveness from a traumatized community is absolution"<br/><br/>What??! Really? More blanket statements that only serve to continue the divide between people...if you don't want people to generalize about you, you need to stop doing it too.<br/>I won't even get into the fact that your non-forgiveness serves no purpose whatsoever except to continue to keep people marginalized and bitter.  So glad the families of the victims chose the higher path.

 I guess the real question is, are these women-and the women who seemingly pay real money for these services and products they're promoting-really that gullible and wasteful? Dear God ! We Americans sound like such irredeemable imbeciles! <br/><br/> The world is experiencing social and environmental upheaval but these women are focused on "high quality manicures" and "charcoal lemonade... with detoxifying clay" to drink?<br/> People are dying in Pakistan right now because they have no water to drink during the heat wave and these sisters are promoting the concept of "young coconut water and mature coconut milk"?  <br/><br/> We are doomed indeed.

I'm all for booting Jackson and keeping Hamilton -- but let's think outside the box: Is there any law that says there has to be only one version of each denomination? Why not have a 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50- AND a 100-dollar bill with women on them, in addition to the ones with men? (Yes, bring back the 2-dollar bill!) And is there still a 10,000-dollar bill? I believe Samuel Chase was on it. Put a woman on that one, too -- Starbucks will gladly accept it in return for a latte!

"the natural order of things"<br/><br/>Guess what?  By three years of age, children spontaneously want to help others in need!   Dogs attached to their owners will refuse food from people hostile to their owners.<br/><br/>Communitarianism is inbred in both humans and even pets.  <br/><br/>Read the Pope's Encyclical.  We can do better!

Speaking of Mississippi, have you ever heard the song that Nina Simone sang about that state?<br/><br/>Here's a sampling of some of the lyrics:<br/><br/>"Don't tell me, I tell you<br/>Me and my people just about due<br/>I've been there so I know<br/>They keep on saying, "Go slow!"<br/><br/>You mentioned that South Carolina is the Palmetto State.  Do you know that the state flag of South Carolina is not the confederate flag but actually a "palmetto" flag?  The SC state flag is a white palmetto tree silhouetted against an indigo blue background, with a white crescent moon at the top left-hand corner.  <br/><br/>If you want to wave around your confederate flag, do it in YOUR OWN backyard, not in the backyard of citizens who consider it an insult.  And by the way, what makes you think South Carolina would even PERMIT an actual vote, really.  Like there wouldn't be blockades set up by the people who want that flag - it's an illegitimate flag, and the vote would end up just as illegitimate as the Confederate Flag, especially in rural South Carolina.

151948
Do you think that President Clinton granting "Permanent Normal Trade Relation" trade status to Communist China and his signing NAFTA into law had anything to do with US jobs relocating to Communist China?<br/><br/>I agree, but we cannot put the cat back into the bag! Most all of the wealth creating US businesses have left the USA and are now gone forever! <br/><br/>The US workers are doomed, thanks to NAFTA, PNTR for communist China, etc.

152271
You may be entirely correct, but the reaction created by the style in which you write and the words you choose to express yourself (revanchists?? Really!) make your thoughts so inaccessable that what speaks loudest is your arrogance. Your job is to communicate not obfuscate. I've been one of your readers for years. This piece is just a poke in the eye with a dull stick.<br/>sorry

Is it not 'framing'?!   The poorest don't participate because their frame tells them there is no future in trying to work their way out of poverty.  The lower and middle classes are exposed to purposely divisive framing which correlates their personal welfare to notions and nostrums served up replete with scapegoats that pushmepullyou away from confronting a deteriorating income distribution and loss of opportunity at their source.   The Republican framing  --warnings against class warfare, socialized medicine, a social safety net for slackers not like us, tree huggers who take jobs, people of color, foreigners  and a tidal wave of gays, feminists and anti-gun rights advocates-- is doubtless comforting.   Framing trumps facts.  An easy story trumps facts.  Not having to wade through the tax code or climate statistics trumps facts.  Not having to know that parental wealth is the prime determinant of children's success is comforting.  Inertia and comfort with what one knows to be true deep down is the inalienable right that they must not be allowed to take away...     History will look back on all of this and see it as a Republican and 1% framing victory that successfully got people to vote against their own interests while thinking they were defending what is good and right.  The framing offers a lottery ticket.  Why do the poor gamble against such odds? Hope is also framed...

Why exactly would you compare things to 2000? Do all the people who lost coverage between then and Obamacare not matter? The recession is one thing, but people who lost insurance from 2000-2008 were likely priced out of the market. Those people deserve affordable healthcare, and they wouldn't have it without this legislation. Your suggestion is apparently just to have kept going, with people dying when their insurers decide, regardless of whether they paid the bills or not, that they weren't worth the cost, and with tens of millions not insured at all, all while prices continued to skyrocket year to year. <br/><br/>I honestly have no idea what point you're trying to make, besides "argh, Obamacare bad, argh!" Is this really all the imagination the anti-healthcare zealots have left? What ever happened to just making things up out of thin air like death panels and death spirals? 

152569
Non-native species? Read Steinbeck!  Salmon and smelt are native to the delta.  Also, what do you think fed Lake Powell and Lake Mead this spring?  Not snow melt, but the flash floods that have peppered the west.  Flash floods are captured by reservoirs or are later pumped as groundwater.

152570
Why haven't we stopped building new homes? Nobody has even mentioned that! There are massive suburban developments on the table which could easily be postponed if not cancelled. Why do I have to take shorter showers while wealthy land developers keep building more homes? Where's the Governor on that issue? I'll tell you where he is- as always, hiding in the pocket of the land developers. Not for nothing, but this guy has got to go! His greatest accomplishment in the last 4 years is banning plastic bags in grocery stores [which was postponed by the way] and allowing dogs to eat with their owners in restaurants with outdoor patios! Good Grief!  

152633
"Smear Conservatives?!"  Since when is telling the truth about what these people are doing a "smear"?  Are "conservatives" afraid of the light being shined on the consequences of their inflammatory, at times disloyal rhetoric and public posturing?  They need to take the rifle sites off their websites, speak and write respectfully about our President, and take responsibility for how their words, attitudes and actions influence others.

152895
Another gun tragedy and we get a swift debate about a cloth flag, but still nothing is done, not even a debate, about the guns?<br/>Just the other day in Mississippi, a man carried a rifle into a Wal-Mart, bought ammunition there and loaded and cocked the gun right there in the store - and the police were unable to arrest him because now laws were broken....!? <br/><br/>I'm all for freedom, but gun rights in this country are far more lenient than is remotely reasonable.

Cruelty is skinning a dog and bashing it over the head - boiling it alive and using a blowtorch - since when is this culture?<br/>Just to add its unnecessary - cruel and wrong in every sense.<br/>Stealing people's pets? So this is culture? Really, well I'm sorry if people think this is ok - they're just as bad as the people doing it and eating them... Why don't you join them!! By the way I'm vegetarian before anyone tries to ask me what's the difference between killing a cow to a dog... Actually quite a big difference

@ Ken<br/><br/>You say:<br/><br/>"Because they have huge oil resources and don't seem interested in climate change why would Iran spend more money producing electricity with nuclear power rather than oil fired plants? That defies logic."<br/><br/> I understand  the dangers  of negotiation;  HOWEVER, diplomacy has no chance if the above canard keeps being repeated by people who appear to apprehend neither logic nor economics.<br/><br/>If an oil-rich country has some maximum production capacity, say 100 units and uses  20 of those 100 units for its domestic generation of electricity, the most oil they can sell is 80 units.  A good way for that country to raise the amount of oil sold by 25% ( from 80 up to 100) is to free up 20 units by generating electricity with nuclear power instead of oil.<br/><br/>True, in the end the Iranians MAY be trying to use electricity generation as a cover for covert production of nuclear arms:  to keep them from doing that is the crux of the negotiation. But  I'm certain our negotiators realize that it is eminently reasonable and logical for Iran to WANT to generate electricity with nuclear energy instead of oil.  <br/><br/>With that understanding, it's then up to our guys (and gals) to craft the agreement so that's the only thing the Iranians CAN do with their nuclear program.<br/><br/>In the end, there may turn out to be legitimate reasons for us to back away from the final agreement, but it won't be some bogus claim that Iran can't want nuclear electricity because they have so much oil!

The first time (?) the Times has acknowledged in print that there's such a thing as a gay accent, and it does to to try to refute it!  Sorry - the gay accent, which shows in a way that being gay is not a choice - is VERY REAL and over 90% reliable.  

153085
This whole piece is pretty silly on the face of it, don't you think? Using only men who are extremely well-known to the public, let's look at this a bit further: <br/><br/>Rock Hudson - Who ever presented a more macho physical and vocal image? He was, of course, gay.<br/><br/>Cesar Romero - Almost ditto the Hudson comment. He was gay, too.<br/><br/>Woody Allen - Very straight (as evidenced by his life), but sounds - what? -<br/>Either gay or very (stereotypically) old-fashioned New York Jewish (but so does Mel Brooks, and he got Anne Bancroft!)<br/><br/>John Hurt - not only sounded gay, but became famous for playing a number of gay men. He was, and is, totally straight.<br/><br/>William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal - one was straight, one was gay. Based on just listening to them speak, however, you'd be hard pressed to tell which was which. But is you SAW them, you'd know pretty damn fast!<br/><br/>Truman Capote - well, okay, you win!<br/><br/>The whole thing is silly and does not belong in the New York Times. Then, again, nor do half of the articles that appear in the Opinion pages these days.

@TWR - but maybe back when you were growing up, your family's middle class lifestyle was NOT that expensive? Times have changed drastically. Today, the middle class can barely keep their head above water. A real life example: The modest 3-bedroom apartment that my single mother bought in 1985 on a part-time income is now selling for FOUR TIMES the price in 2015. I have a husband and we both work and there's no way we could ever afford it. That's not inflation only - things have gotten more expensive.  Here's another example: laptops! I found a slow, heavy one in the back of  my closet from circa 2005 which I bought for 3 times the price of my super fast, slim, lightweight oh-so-superior current laptop. So you know, we can go ahead and teach kids what things cost, but by the time they are grown up in 15 years or so, it will probably be a very different world.

Okay, how about no tax-exempt status for religious organizations?  Why are they given special treatment in the first place?  Other businesses have to pay taxes.  Why shouldn't organizations in the God Biz?<br/><br/>Problem Solved!

153330
When does "traditional" religious bigotry and prejudice against our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters trump common sense, science, biology, and our love for our gay and lesbian neighbors, colleagues, and friends?<br/>When religion gives up tax exemption! Why should gay and lesbian citizen taxpayers subsidize bigotry and prejudice?<br/>Tolerance is giving others the same rights we claim for ourselves.

153343
Piyush, are you ashamed of your name? Where does the Bobby nme come from? Also, your favorability ratings are very, very low. So, why run? I guess you do not want to fade away and you do not want people to forget your name. Go find yourself a job and give the majority of us a rest... from you!

Doesn't the picture say it all?  A protester with a multi-hunded dollar coiffure -- and most likely several hundred dollars more in garments on her back!  It is myth that the poor ever led protest movements.  Lenin and Trotsky themselves  came from the middle class -- who else has the leisure to perform non-remunerative political work?

Who in their right mind would purchase frozen meat packaged in the 1970's, or 1980's? I wouldn't feed it to my dog, let alone to human beings!<br/><br/>Given the pervasive corruption of Chinese government agencies, the nation needs an honest counterpart to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The abuses in this story are reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle."

Ever hear of Nat Turner?<br/><br/>According to History.com, <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/slavery-iv-slave-rebellions" title="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/slavery-iv-slave-rebellions" target="_blank">http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/slavery-iv-slave-rebellions</a>, "...one scholar, Herbert Aptheker, has counted over two hundred plots, conspiracies, and actual uprisings between the early seventeenth century and the Civil War."<br/><br/>And this despite the most fearsome intimidation such that, following some revolts, "...participants were executed in the most brutal manner (individuals were burned alive, broken on the wheel, and subjected to other tortures). The event set a pattern for subsequent uprisings–the violence of the retribution far exceeded the mayhem committed by the rebelling slaves."<br/><br/>In the modern era the 47% are kept down by a justice system that is too often criminal and a media and consumerist culture that dulls the heart and mind, this in league with a "legal" machinery of entrenched social and economic injustice maintained by the far right Republicans and the at-best center-right Democrats.<br/><br/>Referring to the sometimes-violent Shays’ Rebellion Thomas Jefferson expressed the view that “a little rebellion now and then is a good thing” for America even in the form of violent action.<br/><br/>I'm not quite there...yet.<br/><br/>For now I'll support Sanders-Warren 2016 as a solid blow against the empire!

Does the average American know what this means? NO. Do the up coming millenials know what this means? NO. Any of the above even know that their jobs are about to be sent overseas? NO. Will any of those-whose jobs have gone overseas-know whom to blame? NO. <br/><br/>This is a huge problem in the USA.  We are growing an ignorant society, who will listen to the people who have the most money to spend on advertising. It used to be that the "news" gave us all perspectives.  But now that the "news" organizations are run by people who have the most money...well, we get stories about pets, every night, and a slant to every story.  No in depth reporting, because the news industry has become entertainment, and the average American can't be bothered. Welcome to the New World!

Ma'am:<br/>Charity begins at home and with 20 million US citizens and legal residents out of work; why are we allowing more immigrants into this country to take work our own would and could be doing?<br/><br/>We also have stagnant  wages due to so many people looking for the same jobs.  That is a result of supply and demand and that comes from IMMIGRATION!  <br/><br/>When you don't create 2 million jobs but you allow in 2 million new immigrants to work; where are the jobs for your own citizens?  They aren't for that year and there are a lot of years like this.<br/><br/>When you allow illegals to work and do jobs your own can be doing; that not only takes work away from your own but also stagnants wages.<br/><br/>Most countries take care of their own first and it would be very nice if one of them was the USA.<br/><br/>NO amnesty.  NO work permits.  NO nothing but deportation.

So this article basically says that Madonna is trying to hard to be outrageous and it's embarrassing for a woman her age?  But Paul McCartney dyes his shag haircut and cracks and warbles those Beatle hits in a key that his voice abandoned 20 years ago and the media swoons?  And Mick Jagger has basically into a wizened, prancing old gamecock while the Rolling Stones tour will soon become the Rolling Rascal tour and the critics applaud them for their live performance chops and women treat them like rock sex gods?  <br/><br/>Boy  - no ageism to see here - no sir!  Unless you are a woman who dares to think she can perform something besides a Christmas album after the age of 50.  You go, girl.  80s chicks change the world.

But Will…don't you know that it's those "domestic terrorists" that we need to worry about know? Don't bother your brain with nonsense about the TPP. Just throw some salt into the boiling pot and prepare dinner - if you can afford it. Because you know, thanks to Janet Reno et al, that riots in the streets = domestic terrorists. Protesting presidential policies = domestic terrorists. Actively trying to prevent our buffoons in government from getting to their high-paying speaking gigs = domestic terrorism. Look over here…there's nothing to see. Those corporations and bankers and government lemmings are working FOR you and for your benefit. But, hey…over here, look! It's a "domestic terrorist"…

And conservatives who hate this law have proposed legislation to reduce costs of medical care and somehow the ACA prevented them from doing so? I really do not see your point! Reducing medical costs would need cooperation from different groups, including doctors who command high salaries.

 "a rebellion by fellow Democrats" Rebellion? Really.<br/><br/>"Mr. Obama .. leverage ... to force the final concessions needed." An express power, or implied from reading goat entrails? <br/><br/>“He’s had a collaboration across the aisle ... maybe the strongest legacy of his presidency,...."<br/>Can the NYT get legacy addiction intervention? <br/><br/>When Mr. Obama signed bipartisan bills--presumably from Congress--<br/>HE found" "common ground"?<br/>'He looked at his work, and lo, it was good.'<br/><br/>"While they would not say so out loud, White House officials found it easier to work with Congress....." How DID they share? Tapped morse code, pillow talk, whispered?<br/><br/>"Obama aides.. privately praised Republicans..." Unnamed sources?Ha! Gossip baby!<br/><br/>"And Mr. Obama invested more energy  ...  than he had in perhaps any initiative since Democrats lost the House in 2010."<br/>Reads that he was feckless for 5 years. Why? And that 2010 energy investment? I know! 2010 in Massachusetts to keep the senate 60! But...never mind.<br/>"made him look like a lame duck." Internet Merriam Webster:<br/>"1: one that is weak or that falls behind in ability or achievement; especially chiefly British :  an ailing company<br/>2: an elected official or group continuing to hold political office during the period between the election and the inauguration of a successor<br/>3: one whose position or term of office will soon end<br/><br/>If it looks, walks, quacks like a duck, maybe. This is the easy one, the lame duck DEFINITION.<br/><br/>Greatest paper in the world. Why?

Obama postponed most of the worst parts of the ACA until after the 2012 election (gee, I wonder why?) and then the second worst parts (employer mandate) until after he is leaving office! Duh!<br/><br/>Politicians always like to shift the responsibility and dirt onto someone else.<br/><br/>By 2016, employers will be hit with the mandate and millions will be figuring out that the crappy Bronze policy they got isn't worth warm spit when it comes to health CARE -- health CARE is not the same as "health insurance". Insurance you cannot use, or which has costly deductibles and copays, is worthless.

Jihadists?! What about mental health medication. When is the media going to look at the numbers and go after the FDA and pharmaceutical industry for releasing an army of mentally detached killers on the country? Check the backgrounds on mass murders and suicides, and you find a population of people on poorly tested, poorly regulated mind altering mental health chemicals. <br/><br/>The biggest failure in mental health treatment occurs when a patient abruptly stops taking medication. A variety of side effects kick in, and the patient more or less loses his mind. The FDA and drug manufacturers need to be held accountable for the actions of patients on AND coming off of mental health meds. We can start by naming the psychiatrists who were treating these "extremists" and the brand of medication they were using. Call it a reverse NASCAR. If you see a drug name/brand on a murderer, you know it may not be safe for you and those around the user.<br/>One final question, was Roof under care for mental health issues or taking meds?

This whole ordeal begs the question, how much did all this cost "the state" in defense while opponents were arguing over a word or a phrase that even the layperson knows was not inserted to take AWAY healthcare?  Shame on these challengers!  This was all just another tactic to obstruct the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Do you want to live in a just society or not?  As a bonus the ACA is actually helping people and saves money too.  Also, if you have better ideas please share and hopefully they will be incorporated to improve the law (or even replace it if your ideas are superior and convincing to lawmakers).  The beauty of a democratic society!

Only 5 comments so far???  That's is the strongest comment by far!  The stark indifference to this issue should be a major source of shame to all Americans -- especially those so called liberal progressives who read and subscribe to the New York Times.  If organized labor is completely obliterated and wages continue their downward slide, there will soon not be enough tax revenue generated to service the debt our social services industries are presently costing.  That means more cuts to food stamps, Medicaid, school lunches, schools, welfare -- do I have to go on?  NYT readers support welfare spending far more than they want to support good, stable wages.  Without a stable,wage base, tax revenue will decline.  The U.S. can still sell its debt to China and Japan.  That will not go on indefinitely.  What then?

You'd rather save your dimes and let those without health insurance just suffer?<br/> What's the matter with you? We have the worst health outcomes of any fairly rich country in the world. Even Cuba does better!

No examples Charles?  Why? Let me help you:<br/><br/>College admissions<br/>Government jobs<br/>State mandated quotas<br/>The NBA<br/>Government loans<br/><br/>I could go on and on.  What do the above all have in common?  They all fit the definition below:<br/><br/>I prefer the Aspen Institute’s definition: “Institutional racism refers to the policies and practices within and across institutions that, intentionally or not, produce outcomes that chronically favor, or put a racial group at a disadvantage.”<br/><br/>Bravo!!!

And is anyone really surprised that the same three justices who vote down almost anything that goes against the Conservative party and their ideaology did it again here ?!<br/>It is high time that (angry) Scalia, (sleeping) Thomas, and Alito either retire or be removed from this  highest court of the land that is supposed to be impartial and rule on the law only.<br/>They have disgraced themselves and the court once again. Especially because they were willing to let millions lose health insurance they had finally received for the first time in their lifetimes, allow health insurance to be denied to those who have existing conditions, i.e., to go backwards instead of forwards and allow millions to suffer and die each year! So anti-American that it boggles the mind.<br/>Plus they knew their 'puppet masters" had no alternative plan at all . It was all about taking away Predident Obama's greatest and monumental achievement during his two terms in office and add to his legacy !

And who will they be voting for? The same congress critters who voted for the TPP!! Until we truly have an informed, active electorate which votes these devious, despicable "representatives" out of office the downward slide will continue. These are the same states that support "Right to Work" candidates, support candidates who want to dismantle their healthcare, their Medicare, their Medicaid, their Social Security but they vote for them anyway, cause "Hey, I always vote Republican". McConnell won in a landslide even though in several counties 40% of his constituency is on Kynect Care, cause "Hey, I always vote Republican". Police and firefighters support Walker, the union busting governor. Cause "he won't be going after me this year at any rate". In the NYT magazine article on union protests against Walker  ( <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/magazine/scott-walker-and-the-fate-of-the-union.html" title="www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/magazine/scott-walker-and-the-fate-of-the-union.html" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/magazine/scott-walker-and-the-fate-of-the-uni...</a> ) the gross disparities in income were illustrated between union and non union workers. Non union iron workers made less than half what union workers made but there were little to no savings in public works project costs. The owner of the company just got to pocket more of the money. Yet many union workers supported Walker. How do we fix this amount of ignorance? How do force the electorate to become informed?<br/>Massachusetts has 10 congressmen/women and 2 senators. All of them voted against "fast track". Yet few of us will know or care how they voted. Many of us don't even know their names!

How many lobbyists do American Workers have? Right! None. Here in the ownership society, you either own things like lobbyists or you wind up with table scraps...from the floor. About a week ago ordinary people, admittedly, some of whom were hired by Donald Trump, cheered when he revealed that he had a stable of lobbyists who could produce anything for him. The Donald has a voice! American workers not so much....

The new American Dream:<br/><br/>Oh you worked your butt off and make good money? Good, you can pay more taxes than your "less fortunate" counterparts. Oh, AND you can pay more for healthcare too!<br/><br/>If socialism is everywhere now, I would rather move to Europe where it is actually done right. smh.

Is this what we have come to?  Measuring our success by how efficacious our efforts are when we attempt to convince someone that they should accept an incredibly valuable resource (access to a 3rd party payer for healthcare) with a guaranteed offer of coverage at a substantial discount subsidized with federal dollars?  THAT is a measure of success?<br/><br/>If we created a program to essentially hire folks to stand on the street corner and hand out $100 bills, would our measure of success then be how fast passers-by accepted that largesse?<br/><br/>PLEASE tell me we are going to go deeper than that!  PLEASE tell me there will be, at some point in time, at least a modicum of analysis to indicate whether or not these showers of federal dollars actually improved people's lives.  <br/><br/>And can we get really crazy here, and actually analyze whether it improved their lives in the most cost effective way possible?  Oh no, I'm clearly dreaming now.<br/><br/>How can we ever expect the hard working, tax paying middle class to support any expansion of government when we give them the policy equivalent of "social promotion" in moving them to the next grade?<br/><br/>I fear such soft expectations will add even more to the Gridlock in DC, approved by a populace tired of getting so little back for their hard work.<br/><br/>MB

Will freer trade increase the competition from imports (produced with much lower labor costs) and thus displace a number of American workers (who require higher pay than workers doing the same work in Bangladesh)? Yes.<br/>How should we fix this problem? That depend on what you think the problem is. If you see the problem as “people losing the jobs they held for years”, then you might think that the solution is to make sure the same exact jobs stay in the same exact towns where they had been for years.<br/>But this is not the problem that needs solving. The problem is that people need to have a way to earn a decent living. If so, then we should realize that “earning a decent living” does not have to be done by “working at the same job you have had for years”. In other situations, people accept this – the example in this very article talks of a daughter of factory workers who went to college and (notice!) did NOT become a factory worker but rather became an “inner-city social worker with master’s degree”. But in other contexts people can't seem to get beyond "we need to keep job here".<br/>How about this – the way to enable people to earn decent living is not to keep the same jobs in the same town forever, but rather to make sure there are opportunities for people to earn a living by doing something different.<br/>You can’t stop the changes. If not trade, then technological progress will displace workers in the furniture factories. The best you can do is help people adapt to the changes.

Could Americans explain why there was opposition the policy to non-Americans? Basically people don't want to pay for other peoples' healthcare? Baffling!!! And selfish. I'm very happy that my taxes pay for everyone's health care.

Don't you, Margaret, realize that it took NO EFFORT AT ALL to get the Southern politicians to cave on the flag thing? I would imagine it's because they knew they had to do something, and taking down the battle flag was the easiest thing they could have possibly done? From now on, whenever they are approached about continued institutional racism in their jurisdictions, they'll be able to say in frustration "We took down the flag! What MORE could you possibly want us to do?" The minimal effort does not a tipping point make, especially when it comes from a serial hypocrite like Ms. Haley.

Really Jack?  Read my post above.  And the link to the article here in the NY Times a couple of days ago.<br/><br/>Ever read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"?  I have.  Ten times.  It's my favorite book.  Most people cannot even get past the second chapter.  It is really "heady" stuff.  Not for the average, college educated American.  <br/><br/>Jackson has had many of his players read it.  Even Dennis Rodman.  He sits down with them after finishing a chapter to discuss it.  You have no idea what Jackson was able to achieve with both the Bulls and Lakers; this wasn't Tim Duncan (a very unusually modest "Superstar") he was coaching.  It was Michael Jordan.  Kobe Bryant.  Shaq.  Rodman.  etc.  Many of them on the same team.  <br/><br/>It requires more than a deft touch to get them to play together.  It requires a sublime mastery of human psychology that is beyond the grasp of most coaches and sports psychologists to accomplish what Jackson did.  Especially in the NBA!  Talk about egos. <br/><br/>I find your nonsensical assessment to be sophomoric in the shallowness of it's analysis.  You are like one of the throngs of people that stopped at Chapter Two of "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance".  Paradoxically, the very type of people Robert Pirsig "criticizes" in the book.  And Jackson would trade away . . .

Preposterous?<br/><br/>Is there a single Constitutional lawyer on the editorial board?<br/><br/>Because if not, it seems the editorial board is laboring under the misconception that a journalism degree and lots of opinions qualifies them to speak ex cathedra on what is and is not a reasonable legal argument.<br/><br/>A Court decision is not good or bad, based on whether you *agree* with it.<br/><br/>and I have news for some:  premiums, and deductibles, are up.  The ACA is a cash cow for big insurers, and great for people who couldn't afford coverage - the middle class is now paying for them, and higher costs for themselves.<br/><br/>This isn't my "opinion" - any fair assessment shows the costs have gone up, and if you believe this is evidence the "cost curve" has been bent down in future based on government projections, you may still believe in Santa.<br/><br/>Read Scalia's dissent.  His logic is rock solid.  <br/><br/>What we are dealing with is a Supreme Court that has ruled that the Supreme Court is Congress.<br/><br/>No, a bunch of newspaper editors don't get to determine what is legally frivolous, thank goodness, and one wishes people read more about these cases on legal blogs like Volokh, or even the left/statist analysis of lawyers over at Slate.<br/><br/>This is the Supreme Court amending this law for a 3rd time to save it.  Those who like it because they think the ACA is wonderful don't grasp that the Supreme Court is not supposed to be amending legislation.<br/><br/>Don't complain when they amend this or another law in a way you do NOT like!

Meanwhile, I've driven my 10 y/o Prius only 38,000 miles because I'd rather take the bus or ride my bike &amp; just spent 13 hours on Amtrak from VT  to DC to support Cuban Independence from American domination &amp; meddling...as I wait for high-speed trains to criss-cross our country and reunite all of us:  red, white, black, brown &amp; blue to march on Washington, end Corporate Welfare &amp; fire their Lobbyists.

DRS -- AGAIN ??<br/>What about the people on minimum wage and have families - who can barely exist. Where would they get the money to save and buy health insurance???? Or people whose employers do not pay for healthcare???<br/><br/>What about people who can afford healthcare but are denied it because they have a pre-existing condition - many which will eventually make them suffer or eventually and surely kill them.<br/><br/>Stop thinking of only yourself and get off your high horse !! Show empathy for those ill and less fortunate than yourself. We are the richest and most powerful nation in the world. But your personal belief is one that makes us look petty and uncaring in the eyes of other nations of the world.<br/>Healthcare should be a right, not a priviledge !!!

"Charleston Families Hope Words Endure Past Shooting"? In amnesiac, national attention-deficit America?  Doubt it. <br/><br/>Have words of 'hope' endured past the killing of 20 children and 8 adults at a school in Newtown, CT on Dec. 14, 1012 endured; after the Columbine High School massacre that killed 13 on April 20, 1999; those spoken after 12 died near the Washington DC Navy yard on Sept. 16, 2013; after the killing 12 people in a movie theater on Aurora CO on July 20, 2013..., ad nauseam?<br/><br/>Words are cheap; required action lacking.<br/><br/>Address America's penchant for violence, its love affair with guns, its inbred racism and bigotry, its nativism, the root causes of all the bloodletting.  Then move on to 'Hope'!<br/><br/>"Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man." ~ FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

The "confederate "battle ?" flag " . Flying it, loving it, and fighting for it. Can only be interpreted as a secessionist seditionistic rejection of the legal authority of the United States and a call to arms in support of that rejection. Time to send in the troops to establish the legal and legitimate right by conquest of the United States. And people say Obama doesn't love America, isn't American. All the while planting and fomenting the seeds of treason. What sheer unmitigated gall ! Take it down or have it torn down.<br/>Korea flies 2 flags North and South. They don't claim to be united. Vietnam now flies 1 flag it claims unity. Some don't like it but the flag of The former South Vietnam is retired.

"Suppose Mexican-Americans waved a flag depicting the battle of the Alamo? The point would not be to celebrate the slaughter of Texans, but to express pride in Mexican heritage!"<br/>So, the young woman who waved the Mexican flag after getting her diploma at an United States High School in California is only showing her pride for Mexico?<br/>Kristof, you're funny, but better still, instead of roaming around the world, why not go down South and express your feelings, then, and only then will I believe you.

This reviewer is kidding, right? No? Oh! Well, then...<br/><br/>Lighten up, T.S. Eliot!<br/><br/>As others have said, it's a movie about a teddy bear that was magically brought to life and grew to be a pot-smoking, foul-mouthed "bro" with few (if any!) redeeming qualities. The character exists to make vulgar jokes -- Period.<br/><br/>The Kardashian joke isn't just funny -- It's REALLY funny! Anyone who doesn't get that is not who this movie was made for. (Hey, look! He incorrectly indicated a subordinate clause AND ended a sentence with a preposition -- Oh, no! The Grammar Police and astute media critics will say his opinion is valueless, because he can't properly construct a sentence! Well, guess what? That's how people talk and movies like this are movies that regular people think are funny!)<br/><br/>Get over yourself, Miss High-and-Mighty New York Times Critic! It's a gross-out movie about a pot-smoking teddy bear trying to knock up his white-trash wife with someone else's sperm. Did you really expect a pretentious, high-falutin, BBC-style costume comedy of manners? Did you expect Oscar Wilde? Did you expect "As You Like It"? Give me a break!<br/><br/>Some people just don't get it. How these same people get newspaper columns commenting on things they clearly don't like or understand? I have no idea.

You're joking right?  Crying with relief?  I couldn't afford health insurance before Obamacare and the consequences were I had to pay my own medical bills. After Obamacare (ironically named the "affordable" care act) I still can't afford health insurance and the consequence is I not only have to pay my own medical bills, but also pay a penalty.   So explain to me how I'm better off now.   This is the brilliance of Progressive thought.  "We know how to solve the problem of the uninsured, we'll force them to buy insurance under penalty of fine and/or imprisonment; problem solved!"

160631
Hooray for Obamacare?!  Yeah, right.<br/><br/>Hooray for a law written by a congress that can not write, validated by a supreme court that can not read, hated by a populace paying more money and getting less for it.<br/><br/>Sad times for our poor republic.

Ross,<br/>Are you not paying attention? The "conservative alternative to Obamacare" is Obamacare. Whole thing was dreampt up by your buds at conswervative think danks. DUH!

This is exactly the system conservatives said they wanted. Are you saying they were faking it?

Corruption in North American meat production?<br/><br/>Remember the mad cow that showed up in the food chain in Alberta Canada in 2003?  That cow could be tracked to a stall in the US before coming to Canada and was raised for market by a man from the US who came to Canada to "try" cattle farming.  He was quoted in one of our national papers as saying, "Yeah, I knew it was sick...I knew I shouldn't have brought it to market...but I did."  The US cattlemen's lobby had the government close the boarder to Canadian beef for years even though it was shown to be safe, mainly because it was good for their own members.  It costed our cattle farmers billions in lost sales.  Some farmers had to resort to shooting their stock because they couldn't afford to feed them!<br/><br/>And Canadian meat is not full of steroids or antibiotics like some other countries... Give me a Canadian steak any day!

So, basically, you want someone who works at a low-wage job (not by any means because of lack of education, hard work, or virtue, I do hope you realize) to pay EXACTLY the same as, say, you, or Jamie Dimon, or any other rich person?  Even when you must know that that person will not be able to do so; possibly not make enough total income to afford only that?  In other words,your idea is:  if you're poor enough, just go without and go die?<br/>I can't agree: for one thing I'm familiar with the concept of the common good, whereby a healthy population is safer and healthier for all those in it--think herd immunity.  Then too, my belief system, which I of course would not force on you or anyone, leads me to have compassion and concern for my fellow living creatures.<br/>By the way, if you are "now stuck paying huge tax surcharges", you must be quite rich.  Congratulations.  Hope you stay that way, since I wouldn't want to offend your principles by offering you help; outrageous!

it's almost a relief to be able to chew out a leftish environmentalist (and what exactly ARE Greg Laden's credentials, exactly?) for a change.<br/><br/>In the first place, the Times' policy--and Revkin's--is to let 'em yack, unless of course they start threatening or something. the point seem to be to represent views, not censor them. <br/><br/>In the second, no, it is not now and never has been absolutely certain that we know exactly what will happen, and how bad it's going to be. It's simply not, and keeping it in mind that "Hey, maybe the deniers could be right!" is essential to discussing things rationally and making reasonable plans--even though, with more than the fabled purity of Ivory Soap, the science is plenty good enough to tell us clearly that a) the deniers are idjits, and b) we've got a problem we will be dealing with one way or another. <br/><br/>In the third. Science doesn't do absolute certainty. And the claim that it does is just as silly and just as repressive as the denier claim that "uncertainty," means we don't know anything at all so there's no warming, you commies. <br/><br/>but above all. this is just another version of the endless drone from certain "leftists" (who aren't, really) that if Obama had just TRIED, he coulda gotten (insert pipe dream here).<br/><br/>It's a big, complex ecology. The science clearly says that we got a problem here and that we better act, but there's room in there still. <br/><br/>It's just not the kind of room the deniers try to make it.

Do we know what lens the photog used and from what distant because one can make things appear closer together by clever composition and wily use of a long telephoto lens. But at the end of the day, who cares. Cannon balls moved to the road? Oh the horror! Should be kudos instead for executing such sophistication in 1855! Painters do it all the time.

I must say - What are the GOP candidates for president going to say now? Will Chris Christie, about to announce his candidacy, suddenly "see the light" and come out in support of same-sex marriage and Obamacare? Will The Donald declare that the liberals on the Court should be deported to Mexico? Will Rick Santorum move to that ultra-Catholic country Ireland. Hey, wait, Ireland legalized same-sex marriage even before the US did! These have been great days for equality, affordable health care and housing rights. FOX News and Rush will no doubt be "fired up," but with no place to go but down!

161853
Obamacare label unpopular with the GOP? They created it, thinking that anything Obama would stink in the nostrils of the righteous. Hoist with their own petard!

Vindication - by Supreme Court justices who should have their law licenses revoked as they obviously received their law licences from a Box of Cracker Jacks?<br/><br/>Their only role and responsibility was to evaluate the law on its legal basis, NOT on what they thought of its humanitarian and insurance industry impact.  The complete failure of our educational system is clearly demonstrated by the comments to this article.  The writers clearly have no idea what logic is and also apparently have no command of the English language - nor do the Supreme Court justices.<br/><br/>Tragic - the end of the USA is in sight - Obama's goal!

Equal under the Law?  YES!  Congratulations to all my friends and to strangers I'll never meet who will now be able to live their lives as equal citizens.

I surprised myself by essentially agreeing with David's column today, but the fact remains that, while symbols are indeed important (Redskins, anyone?), they are but the low-hanging fruit. I eagerly await a column speaking of the need to truly address the root causes of poverty, the disintegration of black families related to over-incarceration of their men and boys, lack of gainful employment, etc., etc. And not by insinuating that it is due to moral failure, but due to systemic injustices that favor light skin over darker hues. Now that will be a real - and welcome! - surprise.

Why can't we just encourage the Confederacy to secede? We don't need them sponging our tax dollars and we don't need them sullying the good name of the USA with their overt and covert racism. They should be kicked out of the Union so they can proceed to deny voting rights to anyone they wish, mine their southern border to keep out the "others", deny education to all but the most wealthy and deny heath care coverage to all but the oligarchs. Please go! You are bad for the country.

162464
Huh??  The separation of church and state is at the heart of our Constitution.  The fact that 'marriage between a man and a woman is a religious concept that goes back thousands of years' is exactly the point.  It's a religious constraint that cannot be imposed on all citizens.  I am so tired of the 'tradition' argument.  You need to get out of your religious bubble and recognize others' rights under the law.  Slavery was a tradition for thousands of years;  women couldn't vote...  or are those objectionable only because they weren't based on religion?<br/><br/>YOUR RELIGION ISN'T MINE.   I wish that all fundamentalists would get this tattooed on their pointy heads!

Oh, come on, as the late Joan Rivers used to say, "Can we talk?" Mr. Egan, the answer is in following the money; getting access to that money means votes and votes mean access to the entry level position in Congress. That job leads to far greater riches once the arts of kissing the behinds of donors and seducing voters into thinking congresspeople are their representatives are mastered. The Republicans never saw a greenback they didn't like, be it from Mother Theresa or the KKK. <br/><br/>Another Joan Rivers line, "Grow up!" <br/><br/>Ouch! How have I become so cynical?

162747
Are you saying they are going after the churches next?  Boy, won't that be a big surprise!  And then perhaps, with the churches behind us as any kind of meaningful institution, or teacher of right and wrong, we can legislate love with force, as should have been done all along, and call the state our teacher.  <br/><br/>Good luck with that.  <br/><br/>When is the last time you were able to force someone to respect or love you?  Remember that gal (or guy) who got away? Doggone free will (given by God) will threaten and harass the laws progressives make until the end of the age, and progressives will remain embittered and dissatisfied until then and perhaps beyond the grave.  There is nothing new under the sun. <br/><br/>You will need force.  And power.  To keep all these balls in the air. You know, that stuff you say you hate.

Now there is a strained argument--Robert Lee was a good man because he wrote flirtatious letters to women other than his wife?! So much for the "sanctity of marriage."<br/>As for the other anecdotes in support of Lee's kindness, they are strained as well. After all, even Hitler was nice to (some of) his friends, and he treated his pets well. Yet we do not think of him as a kind man. The true test of whether one is kind: are you kind to those from whom you can reap no benefit--the poor, the oppressed? On this count Lee utterly fails. Being nice to one's family and professional peers just does not suffice as a moral test.

162993
So, as long as the Supreme Court agrees with your views, America is the best nation in the world?<br/><br/>America is great because it is based on sound, God-given principles. When we change the principles upon which America was founded, we erode our foundation and head towards collapse. <br/><br/>If your mother was a lesbian, how did you come onto the scene? If being a lesbian is right, where do kids come from? It takes the opposite sex, not the same sex to have kids. What a sad day for America!

163037
Why don't we just eliminate the name Jefferson and Washington and every other significant or insignificant name affiliated with slave-owning??<br/><br/>I wish this country would get a grip and understand that semantics are everything.  If we keep hashing over racism and finding it in every name and phrase, we keep it alive.  <br/><br/>History is rampant with injustices and cruelty.  Oliver Twist was written by Charles Dickens in part to expose the slavery of children. It was generations ago! We have evolved to understand - at least the majority of us - that slavery is wrong, period! And despite the upsurge in human trafficking, we are fighting it, globally!<br/><br/> So for heaven sakes, let by-gone eras be, and stop making them some kind of modern standard or modern symbol.  We're acting like children instead of 21st century creatures that should have the intelligence to look back with dispassionate clarity that the times were immensely different.  It was a different world then.  And the fact that some terribly disturbed young man chose to use it as an excuse to murder doesn't make it any less irrelevant.  Slavery used to be practiced.  It was a long time ago.  We have to move on.

Would you wonder why the Court accepted a case that's affirmed 9-0, or 8-1? Probably not. It could be that one of the four justices -- I'd lay money on Chief Justice Roberts -- voted to take the case if only to say "Enough already, the ACA is the law of the land, and trumped up litigation won't change that!" Perhaps he's tired of the politicization of the courts, using them to get what you can't get in the legislature. I think his quoting from Scalia opinions supports this theory. It shows what has been clear for many years now. Scalia does not vote from textualism, or any other interpretive theory. He has a result, and will use and means necessary to get there. Even if it mean directly contradicting positions he took only a year ago. 

163153
Could you please elaborate on how much the so-called "greek bailout program" has cost you personally until today? Is there any kind of tax established in Germany with the title "for our fellow greeks"?<br/>Would you on the other hand like to see how much (100% documented and 100% imposed from the 'creditors') the greeks have had to pay (you) on "temporary" (yet permanent and always rising!) taxes so that YOU can collect your interest?<br/>"Nothing gets paid back"? Try "nothing gets paid at all". Not a single greek citizen has received a single Euro from the whole "bailout program" in the last 5+ years. Not one. The whole amount was used for paying up old debts. So yes, you are right, if the debts about to expire were lets say 300 Billion Euro, what Europe (Germany) and the IMF decided to do was to say "ok, here's 300 Billion, we are however going to keep that because of old debts, but now you no longer owe us 300 Billion but 400 Billion instead, because of the interest rates of these new "help" packages". The creation of more debt is 100% irresponsible, I totally agree with you. I would also add that the (by command!) creation of a 27% unemployment quota, the diminishing of a GDP by over 25% and the demolition of small private businesses as well as wages in general which lead to 1/3 of the population living under the limits of poverty and more than 50% barely making through the month, is also very irresponsible. But you made a mistake on who is to blame for it. 

163161
Should this be obvious to a Liberal? Greece is like a "dead beat dad" in jail who can't pay child support while the EU female states come by the jail to get pregnant. Someone has to pay for the children, housing, etc...<br/>Why you know this as money from the federal and state gov'ts of child support, HUD, Medicaid, is all given, while the debt accumulates for the dead beat dad. Perpetual isn't it!<br/>No way out? Go with Russia.

To those who say they "believe marriage is between a man and a woman", but mean that their belief must be forced on others:<br/><br/>Is it our privilege to decide the marital, medical, and legal relationships of strangers?  Are people of other faiths, or of no faith at all, required to follow our religion’s dogma?  When we tell other-believers that their spiritual/existential beliefs are wrong (or worse), and that they are damned unless they convert to our religion, is that as profane, blasphemous, and sacrilegious as when they tell us the same things about our faith? <br/><br/>We live in a crowded theater.  Is it good for us to express our "Fire!" because we can?  We have our beliefs, and they have theirs.  Are only our beliefs sacred?  They have their values, and we have ours.  Are only our values inviolate?<br/><br/>Shall we embrace freedom or fascism?  Society or sociopathy?  Coexistence or conquest?  If we don’t believe in something, we don't engage in it; isn’t that freedom?  If they believe in that same thing, they engage in it; isn’t that society?  If we disagree with their free choice, their lives are still theirs to live, not ours; isn’t that coexistence?<br/><br/>Would the world be a better place if we respected other shepherds’ pastures, held only ourselves to our own values, subjected only ourselves to our own religion’s demands, and expressed our beliefs by personal example and general invitation rather than by displays of contempt, trespass, and cruelty?<br/><br/>Shouldn’t we discuss these things?

Is it at all possible that you may have missed something? Or are inserting meanings and definitions that are not applicable in how you define what you see and hear?<br/>The main effort of all GOP rhetoric is to disrupt the rational parsing process and substitute their own. What's that term ? Disrupt and redefine! It describes a manipulation technique for diverting the attention from reality to what the manipulators wants the vic to see.

So elderly or sterile heterosexual people -- who can't reproduce -- shouldn't get married? Or asexual heterosexual couples, who choose not to have intercourse at all, may as well? Yet, they can, legally, marry with no problem! Your argument does not hold water.

164531
The American Way?  Sir, you are out of touch.  It was!  It was voted on by the people in NUMEROUS states!  The ONLY reason this was approved was by the Courts!  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  <br/><br/>If you are going to be excited about this ruling (which is fine), then at least don't get your facts wrong. 

164765
Now can we please allow women to make their own decisions about their bodies without interference from men and their sexist laws?  Women bear the brunt of degradation throughout this country and abroad.  Must we challenge this bias state by state?  Women are also created equal and have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It says so the the constitution!!!

164861
"divorce, adultery, sexual license, hedonistic behavior, and lack of education of children" caused the fall of Rome? HA! Re-read your history.<br/>Why is it that whenever the current of contemporary social values pushes people beyond their personal boundaries of acceptable norms, dooms day predictions are abound. Similar things were said when slaves were freed, women were given the right to vote, (insert any movement where individuals were granted liberty and equality). America is, and will remain, strong. Giving more people the right to marry is not going to change that.

165608
Sorry, but nothing that you described has ANYTHING to do with marriage or cake (?!).<br/>Kid yourself, but do not try to kid the world.  You talked about the allure of celebrity by Academics and Doctors, don't you see that this same allure has now infected our very nation's Supreme Court.  They just want their names in the history books; Or is it just a coincidence that this ruling comes right before Pride week?<br/>Our country needs to treat all with respect and value.  Native Americans are killing themselves every day because of they are still looked down as as savages, poor people freezing in the streets, women working two jobs and fighting still for equal pay, Mexicans being deported and ripped from their families, African Americans profiled and killed in states by Police.  Nothing is different now except that once again, instead of really dealing with the problems of HUMAN rights, we've got a group forcing their agenda.  It's just all about "ME" is so out of control that you don't even see how myopic your view is. 

165648
If Justice Scalia has such disdain for the Court, why doesn't he leave? He says that the Court makes a mockery of democracy. Applesauce! The Court IS democracy: It is part of OUR democracy, part of this amazing system of government that our Constitution gives us. Today's ruling isn't a demonstration of failure of our democracy. It is a demonstration of how our democracy works, how it is supposed to work.

So Rodney Dangerfield's constant self-loathing insulted you?  He made a living off of putting himself down (he really was a very insecure man).  It was funny.<br/><br/>Rickles was a funny guy.  "Putting down others" was his shtick.  It was an act.  That it flies right over your head does not surprise me in the least.  Rickles ridicule of audience members and people in his presence was a way of engaging them in the joke.<br/><br/>He was a fat little Jewish boy who got his start in little clubs around New Jersey if my recollection serves me correct.   Part of his act involved making fun of Italians/Italian mobsters while they were sitting in the audience.  It made him very nervous at first, but he was a huge hit with them.  If you can make Mobsters laugh at themselves, I think you have earned your bones.  <br/><br/>That takes guts.  Very few comedians could have pulled that one off.  Rickles was brilliant.  That's why he was one of Johnny Carson's favorites.  He was ruthless when it came to poking fun at Carson's numerous marriages/divorces/wives.  But he could make Johnny laugh at Johnny.  That is high art!

This is from an atheist and Obama supporter:<br/><br/>Marriage equality?!?  Marriage is not a right, it is a privilege afforded  on couples in order to foster production and up-bringing of future generations. Societies since the dawn of civilization recognized that the special status, sanctity (in religious and non-religious sense) and financial privileges associated with marriage were guardians of the family stability and success in procreating and upbringing of children.  All kinds of reasonable civil union privileges should be an adequate protection for everybody else including ability to adopt children with attendant economic benefits. Marriage should be reserved for a union of men and women aimed at generation of future generations.  Now everybody can marry anybody, be it for a day or month!

Can we not take at least 24 hours to celebrate this amazing event and reflect on all of the current people and those throughout history that played a part to make this possible?  Yes, there are still more battles to fight, but it's not as if these battles are new ones that came about as the result of the right to marry - they have been around forever.  <br/><br/>Personally, for the first time in a long time, I will attend the gay pride parade in NYC this weekend; and I will cheer as loud as I possibly can when those from the Stonewall riots come by.  I think we in the gay community need to make sure that the younger generation that never experienced growing up having to be "in the closet" understands just how long this fight has been and show the much overdue appreciation for those who began the fight.  <br/><br/>Right now, it is time to celebrate - without abandon!

Lilly, what else are we going to ask about - the prescription opiate use by all members of the household?<br/><br/>No - if there is a concern about mental health or depression, again, there are *experts* to refer the situation to.  It's a matter of concern whatever risk profile you or a teacher would deign to attach to the situation.<br/><br/>Gun ownership is among those things that denote cultural things to many people.  I've known people who get very upset to find out a 6th grader went hunting with a parent!  We don't need that sort of thing either.

Why is it that I am not out on the streets celebrating an enormous victory in  the Supreme Court? I am bisexual and was married for over twenty years to a women with whom I had two children. Once the girls were old enough to understand, my wife and I separated and then divorced. All three have been strong supporters of my sexuality. Once I was separated, I began to date men. Oftentimes, it was tawdry. I did have one long-time relationship but that eventually ran its course. I am now in a wonderful relationship with another man . . . who happens to be married to another man! My point is this: Congress can pass all the laws it wants; the Supreme Court can pontificate all it wants; but at root are the humans we are. We are unpredictable, untruthful, yet deeply wanting love and desperate to find a relationship that means something. No matter what laws are passed and decisions rendered, none of them will deal with the fundamental problem: that we are humans and are just too complicated for any law or decision to resolve. I see new initiatives ahead: it is strange, very strange, but I think that Justice Scalia was correct when he predicted that acceptance of same sex marriage would lead to other taboos being questioned. I rejoice in today's decision, but I also fear.

168333
Can we start an "Occupy GOP" movement? If enough of us register as Tepublican, dare I hope we save the future of the two oarty system?<br/><br/>Because with every hateful, anti-constitutional utterance coming out of prominent GOPers like Scalia or Cruz, the GOP slips further into oblivion.<br/><br/>Great day  in America!

Is this the same TJ who owned slaves while writing about the freedom of all men but not women? Or did i confuse him with the slave owner who fathered children by his slaves and denied it? Or am I wrong again? <br/><br/>It is easy to write I love you. It is more difficult to mean it. And even more difficult to live by it. <br/><br/>Let's start the discussion by quoting Gandhi? Paraphrasing: I am a Jew. a   Christian and Hindu, Islamic and atheist? Or paraphrasing again, I would die for many things but kill for none.<br/><br/>The religious right is wrong again. They know nothing of what god wants or needs. Love thy neighbor is never mentioned by them as they quote the most hideous parts of the old myth tales. Why don't they quote Jesus' many sayings, parables and describe his many actions about homosexuality? <br/><br/>The reason is that he said nothing about homosexuals and performed no event related to same. He did say, "Suffer the little children..." And unfortunately, the world got a taste of how that played out. He also said, "Those without sin should cast the first stone." None did as they slivered away."<br/><br/>After all as all unionists know when negotiating a contract the first thing to do is describe the job. Somewhere in all those ancient myths god (pick your favorite) made it a non-negotiable subject of negotiations when s/he/it said: "I am what I am." and that 'am' is judge! <br/><br/>So stop asking people to justify human limitations and prejudices and sending money to support '..you way of life..."<br/><br/>Stop it.

When I married in the early '80s, choosing to keep my birth name wasn't a feminist statement so much as  a matter of practicality ( why go through the hassle of changing it legally?) and professional considerations. Still, my husband's family and even mine never respected the choice; greeting cards were always sent to MyFirstName HisLastName, and they introduced me to others that way.  <br/><br/>Worse, at that time American Airlines' frequent flier program would not recognize a couple as married if their last names weren't identical ( and points weren't otherwise transferable then)-- infuriating! (They did correct the policy eventually.)<br/><br/>In all the years since, I've only used my husband's name a handful of times, when dealing with tradespeople  or contractors he contacted first, for quick identification when no lasting relationship was necessary.

People who in the past wouldn't have answered the phone, now won't answer a text?  I'm shocked!  People who in the past wouldn't have accepted the childish hint and moved on, still won't accept it?  Well, maybe it's not so shocking, after all.

@ Paul — “The best passer on our team is a center half?”<br/><br/>Did you mean, “center •back•”? I infer so, from your mention of Johnston in the immediately following sentence, but you might well be contemplating something I’ve totally missed, so it’s best to ask!<br/><br/>Of course (as you previously hinted at), when a team’s best passer has been a center back named Beckenbauer, that hasn’t worked out so badly. One hopes the coaches in charge of the team over the next decade will figure out the most advantageous way to use such a superb talent.<br/><br/>— Brian

How is an onion a lightbulb in the fridge? Who keeps onions in fridges?

I did most of the puzzle before going out to dinner -- got stuck in a few places (maybe it was hunger?) -- and when I came back the rest of the empty squares fell into place quickly and neatly.  I like it when that happens!<br/><br/>I had gotten most of the theme entries the first go-round, so the empty spots left were pretty ECLECTIC.  NO TV and OPIUM DEN were one such area, as was DOUBLED OVER and AMAT (not AMAS).

Have the Republicans been pleased with the outcomes of the last two elections?  If not, they might look at how their primary process had the nominee sell out to the far right and become unpalatable to the general electorate.  Since the GOP already has more candidates than anyone can count on their hands (another to join Tuesday!), the prospects for mainstream appeal look bleak.

Although some may consider the following off topic, I insist it is not - There are complicated causes and effects that are being ignored such as: Why is it still impossible to get those 28 pages concerning the 9/11 attack, made public? It is an important issue.  I believe it shows that, at least one of our "friends" is really something else!  We must not remain fools!<br/><br/>Does anyone out there actually care?

What's next on the forms? Was your child planned or unexpected? Traditionally conceived or in a lab Petri dish? Was your child conceived while on top or bottom? Any miscarriages or still births? We're either of the parents on any medications at the time of conception or during pregnancy? Any history of birth defects on the maternal or paternal side of the family? Is the father really the paternal father? Has anyone in the  been genetically cloned. How many partners have the mother/father had? Are you still able to conceive?<br/>Really?! Enough is enough already!<br/>Generic form or not - that information is recorded somewhere &amp; with the age of technology that very information can potentially land in the wrong hands.<br/>For people who feel they need to share every bit of personal information, let them.

Inspired by Professor Cowen, I've invented a new app ideal for the Freelance Sharing Economy:<br/><br/>The Dickens -- Can't get a loan because you've gone bankrupt before? Feel like you have no collateral to offer? Don't be so unimaginative! You still have something to put on the line: your physical freedom. In this disruptive twist on the old tried and true motivational technique of debtor's prison, your banker permanently straps your GPS-equipped smartphone to your ankle. If you are late on a payment, your lender activates it and you simply never leave your house until your debts are paid off by your relatives. (When you think about it, don't they owe you?) Comes with a HuluPlus subscription so you can catch up on your Binge TV watching. (What happens if you try to sneak out? That's for us to worry about.)

Does self-control work for high blood pressure? Diabetes? Okay, maybe to a point; both are diseases strongly influenced by diet and exercise. But not completely, and refusing to include medication when necessary is foolish.<br/><br/>What about infection? Is self-control the best treatment for sepsis? Does it work for heart attacks? Is the best management of epilepsy to just will yourself to stop having seizures?<br/><br/>This is the attitude that stigmatizes mental illness and makes it hard for people to seek treatment and, all too often, leads people to decide to try to stop treatment because there's something wrong with medication, leading to relapses just like the one that Ms. Lowe describes.<br/><br/>Sometimes we have illnesses of mind or of body or of both. Lifestyle modification is a part of treatment, but only a part. The right meds are critical too!

Everyone listen to him" lol<br/><br/>Regarding the science of global warming, checkout<br/>@tan123<br/>@stevesgoddard<br/>And the third party charts they post and then ask yourself if there's truly no scientific basis to reject the Mann-made climate hysteria.

"What's the article really about?" is a great question. What's depressing is that this is put in a "Special Mental Health Issue' of the most prestigious paper in America. The whole issue looks like it was thrown together overnight by a high school journalism club. Thank you for asking!

If a woman is not considered responsible for her behavior when she decides to get drunk (not incapacitated, just tipsy), why should a man be held responsible for his behavior in the same circumstances?<br/><br/>In other words, if two people freely decide to have sex when they are both drunk, why is only the man considered responsible for his behavior, but not the woman?<br/><br/>This has led to many accusations of rape by women days later, after much encouraging discussion with their friends, even though the women not only consented to the encounter, but encouraged it.<br/><br/>Only a young woman would want women painted as delicate flowers, incapable of making choices about their bodies and sexuality, unable to bear so much as a catcall on the street or an awkward pass on a date (he touched my arm!), because only a young woman, having grown up with reproductive rights that older women could only dream of (and many died from the lack of), would think it a great idea to have the government step in to 'protect' them from their own bad choices.

Jake, if God -- whom you presumably believe to be the Creator of all things -- does not approve of homosexual sex, then why did he create homosexuals in the first place?  Was that some kind of glitch? An oversight? (And if so, wouldn't God be powerful enough to correct his mistake once he saw what some of his creatures were up to?)  Or are you suggesting that he takespleasure in tormenting his own creations? (Okay, fellas, I made you gay, but if you dare have relations with other gays then you are going to burn in hell!)<br/><br/>Just doesn't make sense to me.

Will gay rights opposing churches lose their tax-exempt status? If so, it will give those folks a chance to make a sacrifice for their faith, if they have the guts for it. No church should be tax-exempt!

Man-up and British?  Don't think that will happen anytime soon!  Present day Britian is just as dysfunctional as Alex.

The Greeks have no power? Let them walk from the EU and the ECB and expose them for who they really are: the Emperor with no clothes. All the riches and no brains. All the money and no sense. Let the Greeks walk and show a path for other EU countries to follow in the Greek's path, or at least emulate them. Let them show Europe and the rest of the world that the oligarch's grip is nothing without acquiescence, without a fear that the money flow will stop. This is all the banksters have going for them, a fear of the unknown. A fear that we must bow deeply to the monied people for our lives and stability, that only with the oligarch's money can the simple people be assured of a nice Sunday walk in the park, and the only price needed to be paid is with our futures and our children's futures.<br/><br/>Huff and puff all you want German banks. When little Greece finally stands up to your bully tactics will you German bankers find out that you are not full of wisdom. You German bankers are full of something else.<br/><br/>Go Greece! Go the way of Iceland! Your choice is fine. You may have to suffer for a little while but at least you will be free of the prison wardens of the ECB. Let the ECB Eat Cake!

Were the money for "bloating" came from and who made these unwarranted loans? Germany and French banks! Why just blame and punish Greece and not the greedy lenders. Germany is the major beneficiary of Euro currency which keeps its currency diluted at the expense of countries like Greece, Ireland and other poor EU countries. All the aid Greek received, it went to these banks, it did not help Greece and made the debt worse. Germany is adamant not to share any of the benefits it got from EU currency and that is major hurdle in any solution to the problem.

Move closer to Russia?! You mean like Cuba did? That worked out well, didn't it.<br/><br/>Greece is a sad case. In 430 BC Pericles made a bad decision in the war with Sparta. He decided to draw back to within the walls of Athens. Greece has never recovered from that bad decision and it has continued to make bad decisions over the past 2400 years. Now it decides to withdraw within its wall once again. Good luck Greece.

171725
European nations are quarreling about money? <br/><br/>Again? <br/><br/>Recently, in historical terms, a conqueror emerged from this sort of hostile behavior, soon followed by a world war. Europeans are arguing about what, to this citizen of the USA, seems a paltry sum of a few hundred billion dollars. <br/><br/>What's the problem? <br/><br/>I would vote that we, the US, just give Greece the money they need. <br/><br/>Yes, bail them out!  <br/><br/>If ours is the greatest country in the universe, etc., etc., this great country should be able to help its friend Greece. It would be much less costly to us than eventually - again - putting our boots on, and our bodies in, European soil. <br/><br/>And, the last thing we, or the world, need is another emperor unleashing the Eastern horde (and nukes) upon western civilization.

Oh, but when Florida takes more from the federal government than it sends in federal taxes, all while heaping scorn on the federal gov't and bragging that it has no state tax, that is ok?  <br/><br/>So, basically, you are living off the "drug" of my tax money, since the two states I have lived in, NY and CT, send way more money to Washington than they receive back.  Basically, your state is robbing mine, and I am tired of paying for my services plus yours.  I agree, the "use of the drug" must stop - pay your own way!

171822
Are you honestly saying with a straight face that the US would ever even suggest that "Greece should leave the euro"?  No one in any official position would even whisper that, even if they are thinking it.<br/><br/>If the europeans are the power that they love to make themselves out to be, then what would they care what the U.S. thinks?  Instead of whining about the U.S., take action, clean up your own mess!  If you are uncomfortable with the U.S. pushing, germans seem to love putin - cast you lot with him.<br/><br/>I see the disease of everything being "Obama's fault" has spread to European conservatives as well.

What's the expression?..."Good people generally do good.  Bad people generally do bad. But for good people to do bad, that takes religion."  Ain't that the truth!

If the Greek people vote no, will they receive their next government check in Euros?<br/><br/>If the Greek people vote no, their government will not have sufficient borrowed Euros to pay the Greek Government payrolls.<br/><br/>Any new freshly printed sovereign paper money (such as Greek Drachmas) would not be honored to purchase anything in Greece or anywhere else. <br/><br/>If Greece, France or any other PIIGS nation should withdraw from the EU, they probably would have to use US Dollars and Euros for their daily Business operations, Retail and Wholesale since their nation’s freshly printed sovereign paper money would not be accepted by anybody anywhere.<br/><br/>How many Greek citizens living off of Greek Government Checks and Greek government Contracts can the Greek Taxpayers afford to support?<br/><br/>When most of the Greek citizens are supported by Greek government payrolls or Greek Government contracts, then that is a liberal or maybe a socialist/communist form of Government!<br/><br/>Germany always loaned the Greek government more and more money to pay for their government activities, just like the BRIC nations are doing for the USA, and now the Greeks are mad because Germany will not loan their Greek Government any more money to pass out to the Greek Citizens.

And what is the real purpose of very early retirement ages?  To clear the way for younger people to have jobs.  Those retired people are living longer and longer, but if they work as long as they are physically able to, then there are fewer and fewer job openings.<br/><br/>There's a point where human society becomes unsustainable.  Everything is connected.  We had stories last week about the depletion of major world aquifers.  There is a limit to how many people the earth can sustainably support.  But we need a constant flood of young people to support the costs of aging populations that don't die off as they used to.  <br/><br/>Thriving economies need customers, but all those customers are competing for the basics of life.<br/><br/>But meanwhile--I think we can hardly criticize Greece.  The people we elected brought us a war that opened the gates of hell on the whole world.  The EU is fighting amongst its member countries on how to absorb the refugees we created.  We don't even accept as refugees the Iraqis and Afghans who helped us!<br/><br/>The debt we owe the world for what we have done to it is far greater than the monetary debt Greece owes the EU banks.  We're never going to pay up.  Why should they?

172300
Here's a thought:  Could we crowd-source refinancing some Greek debt at, say 5% instead of the obscene rates they are being charged?  How about it, KickStarter some such.  Why should we?<br/><br/>Since Bretton Woods at the end of WWII the Western countries have been in many respects effectively run by the banks.  The concept of sovereign debt has been twisted, especially in the 2nd and 3rd world, into a well-documented racket in which banks lend ever-more money to countries  Then, when repayment starts to fail for whatever reason including massive corruption, the IMF and World Bank and other companies tie refinancing the debt to the banks taking over economic policy of the victim country.  International lending is effectively a protection racket, as in "You have to pay because we wouldn't want something bad should happen to your little country here, would we?".<br/><br/>Only this time is is not some small third world country or a Latin American country after the collapse of a Junta.  This time it is Greece, a long-time NATO ally, victim of the Nazis, and center of Western History.  Home of the Olympics.<br/><br/>Not crowd-sourced gifts, but loans at fair interest, parallel banking.  Let's give it a try!

Who needs to breathe unpolluted air when there's money to be made?<br/><br/>It wouldn't be right, would it, to force industries that spew out mercury and other dangerous toxins to pay "punishing costs" for the privilege of poisoning the nation's air and water?<br/><br/>And this ruling comes from the United States Supreme Court, America's final refuge for citizens seeking justice and redress of grievances. <br/><br/>And while many of us excoriate the court, let us not forget the shameful role of former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in bringing us to this auspicious moment. <br/><br/>O'Connor cast the pivotal vote that gave us George W. Bush as President. Then she resigned because she had better things to do. Bush replaced her with Justice Samuel Alito, then went on to appoint Chief Justice Roberts.<br/><br/>Thus we have the Roberts Court, the resulting oligarchy and Citizens United, among other democracy destroyers.<br/><br/>Heckuva job, Sandy!

On some level shouldn't the metric be that low-income housing is provided and that be enough?  The fact that one receives subsidized housing doesn't give them the "right" to choose where that housing is located.  Certainly not when there are people paying market rates in those areas and stretching themselves to send their children to nice schools.<br/><br/>Apparently the phase "beggars can't be choosers" no longer applies according to the Supreme Court.  Beggars can be choose, and they choose to live right next to you, in the neighborhood you worked so hard to get into!

Bev - Remember those two killers who were roaming free in NYS the last few weeks? Put yourself in the position of a mother of children living there during that time. Maybe number four is too low! 

173111
Well, where to you get the idea that a stimulus without enforced reforms would have created a change in Greece and not simply a continuation of the bubble years? That unsubstained assumption collides with known facts, like that many industrial enterprises couldn't adjust to the strong Euro, while the retail sector grew excessively! The valuable, productive jobs were long gone and wouldn't have magically come back by pumping more money into the country! There had to be systemic reforms first, unpopular ones that the Greeks wanted to avoid. The Troika pushed as good as it could, but in the end, the forces behind the status quo succeeded. Greece is a hopeless case, can't make it under Euro conditions, and people in other nations rightly reject to send even more money there.

173261
"Where it matters least" you say?!<br/><br/>Do you like clean water, clean air, and clean soil? Do you enjoy the benefits of a healthy ecosystem within which your body, and those of your family, can live long and prosper?<br/><br/>That you consider this a "matters least" issue is, I am afraid, an all-too-common sentiment among people in the developed world. We consider our air, water, and soil as something granted, if we even consider these things it all. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and talk a walk in the woods soon, and then sit quietly and think about your place in the natural world. Realize that the only reason you are able to live and breath here is a direct bi-product of the health of our ecosystem and environment at large. Because, whether you think so or not, your very health, and that of your family and those you love, depends on the health of our planet.

Why should the Environmental Protection Agency have to prove economic efficiency before it decides whether poisons should even be regulated?  Determining whether something is dangerous and needs to be regulated needs to come before the process of crafting regulations, and you can't do a cost-benefit analysis with regulations that don't exist!<br/><br/>Most of the time, each side in a divided Supreme Court has a rational argument for its position.  But there's not reason behind a decision like this.  The decision has nothing to do with the merits of the case, and everything to do with partisan politics.  Forcing federal agencies to regulate backwards and do nothing that would cost money is the antithesis of good government.  <br/><br/>That seems to be the aim of Republicans these days: preventing government from doing anything really useful to help the American people.  The founding fathers thought that government existed to do the people's work; Republicans think it's mainly there to prevent organized labor, free public education, immigration, immorality, and to keep women and minorities from putting on airs of "equality."<br/><br/>There ought to be a word for people who favor a small, weak, and ineffective government, incapable of doing anything but safeguarding wealth and privilege against the immoral, unwashed masses: "hypocrats."

173322
“painful deaths?”<br/><br/>No we are talking about a grotesque death as the body fights this short term medicine.  The body’s reflexes take over and the brain sends the message to the body..”We can’t breathe--do something!”  So the person now uses every muscle in his torso, neck, and abdomen to try to inhale oxygen.  The brain sends out MORE distress signals..”Do something!”  The person writhes and gasps--EXACTLY like a dying fish thrown into your boat.<br/><br/>The guttural gasping continues.  It is horrendous.  And the brain is STILL trying to get oxygen...until the oxygen can’t get there as the sedative just won’t let natural breathing happen.  The brain dies..shuts off all signals and the person dies.

173603
Why does the author write that "in sifting through and producing such a large number of emails, it stands to reason that some would be missed"? Given the importance of this issue, I'd expect that Clinton or her aides would have gone over the records several times with a fine-toothed comb. I'd hope that no e-mails would be missed, because even one might prove crucial for the historical record (or even for actual policymaking!). This is especially true since it was not the State Department's responsibility to make sure that she was turning over complete records; it was her responsibility to make sure that all of the necessary records were being turned over. If Clinton or her aides did NOT go over the records extremely carefully, then the question is: why not?

173616
Of those countries with a death penalty, how many go through contortions to sanitize the executions, versus hanging or putting a bullet through the brain?  Just the U.S.A.?  A society may not be 'above' killing in retribution, but we Americans surely have gone to extreme lengths to distance ourselves from the reality of what we do.  Make no mistake - we are killing convicts just as sure as if we didn't draw &amp; quarter, or burn at the stake.<br/><br/>Anyway, a more useful way for abolitionists to approach the issue of death penalty would be to focus on the wrongful convictions.  Is it cruel and unusual to have a method of punishment that eliminates our ability to right past wrongs?  There's no question any more that wrongs are inevitable and, if they were predictable, there wouldn't be wrongs!

173621
How can you compare the two? The US can borrow at very low cost to improve/repair its infrastructure and repay its debt by printing as many bills as it wants. This is not an inflationary policy as we have seen in the aftermath of the recent economic depression. Greece however has its hands tied and it can't print Euros!

173828
Did Anyone actually read the briefs in this Case?  This case was actually about how to regulate power Plants.  The EPA has not lost the authority to regulate them,  In fact, Congress setup the HAP program specifically to regulate them within the Clean Air Act.  The EPA was actually trying to do an END RUN around the law that congress had setup.  PLEASE.  Actually read the briefs and Don't go by 6 paragraph article to the left.  This was a very narrow ruling based on Administrative Law.<br/>The Clean Air Act has been on the books since 1990.  And Now 25 Years Later, the EPA determined they had the authority to regulate all Emissions from power plants under this program as well as the HAP program?    That takes some real creative writing in Administrative Law.  Even the SG had to admit the EPA has never construed this part of the Clean Air Act this way.<br/>If you want the law Changed,  Goto congress!  Don't let some agency change it for their own purpose!  Who knows,  you might end up on the other side of some Agency Action that you disagree with!  See: Sackett V EPA.

173877
When a society decides that state-sanctioned murder is de rigueur what difference does it makes how it's done?  Return to the days of execution as theater, public hangings in the town square.  Cotton candy and ice cream.  Bring the kids!

A strange and inconsistent argument:  if everyone leaves the Euro zone, how exactly will the Euro be stronger?  Of the other three southern European countries you mention, all have made the necessary structural reforms and are in a better position economically than five years ago.  There are still problems, and still some way to go, but the Portuguese, Spaniards and Italians firmly grasp the concept of paying taxes, an idea that appears incomprehensible to many the Greek people, and certainly to their government.<br/><br/>One of the problems faced by all four countries is the renegotiation of debt, encouraged by those great innovators of the financial industry, especially Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, which led to a ballooning of interest charges.  Adding to that, especially in Spain, was a real estate bubble created (again!) by the investment banks by suppressing interest rates and encouraging borrowing by individuals who could not really afford to.

what ghetto - where?  just look around at Manhattan today<br/>with it's overpriced high risers where Russian Oligarchs<br/>and Chinese billionaires dwell or just invest - this city has<br/>become a center for the very rich and is unaffordable for<br/>what is left of the middle class - now the nouveau poor.<br/>what are you all talking about? and where do you dwell?<br/>who are  you complaining about?

Who's that joker from California that railed against EPA rulings such as limits on gases that deplete the ozone layer? Hello? That one has been established science for decades! How many millions of cases of skin cancer would we have today without the limits on CFCs? <br/><br/>The constantly growing depth of institutional stupidity of Republicans never ceases to amaze me.

174457
Why does this befuddle the Supreme Court? Perhaps because it is not so much about how the condemned person feels, either dying peacefully or agonizingly at the hands of the State, but it is really about how we all feel. We want it clean, neat and without complications. Poof! Dead. Some of us don't care if there is pain and some even like that idea- part of the punishment. Problem is, when we actually like the idea of inflicting pain and torture, we come up against our own Constitution. Why did the framers find importance in limitation of cruel and unusual punishment? Probably because, at the very least, it mimics... revenge. Not a good function for a government. Any government.<br/><br/>If we cared about how the ones we put to death feel- physically or emotionally, we would not be playing this silly game. There are dozens of ways to end someone's life quickly and without pain. We are stymied here because it is really about our inexorable discomfort with death, especially death by execution. Forget about what pharmaceutical company refuses to sell it's drugs for use in executions- that's irrelevant. It's all about how we feel.<br/><br/>And no matter what method we use- bullet, noose, guillotine, gas, electricity or drug, we're just never going to feel okay about it. Unless it's processed as revenge. Then, we feel great. How sad for us.

174557
How about agreeing on just one thing?<br/><br/>No more Bush's.  No more Clinton's.<br/><br/>See; that was easy!

"Why no similar scrutiny for male candidates?"<br/><br/>Because any question about Mrs. Clinton is sexist?<br/><br/>But if it makes you feel better, let's investigate all of Bernie Sanders trips to Canada.  I hear he's bootlegging maple syrup out of Quebec!

174852
How long should we wait for this to happen?  *cough*<br/><br/>Ten years?  *cough cough*<br/><br/>Twenty?  *hack!  wheeze...*<br/><br/>(Hey, why is this water rising up around my ankles?  And where did all these dead polar bears come from?)

174873
Putting aside the bigger questions about the continuance of the death penalty, can I ask what I think is a basic question about method? (and please forgive my utter ignorance about midazolam medically).  During the oral argument in this case, it sounded to me like enough midazolam would kill someone, similar to morphine.  Is that true, and if so, why have a three-drug protocol instead of just giving the condemned prisoner an overdose of midazolam and thereby ensuring a painless death?  Why even run the risk of any pain to the prisoner?  What am I missing?  <br/><br/>Thanks very much!

Sure and how many of those 200 matches also featured a team focused around Rapinoe, Wambach and Morgan?  I think that was Ella's larger point.  Interesting decisions ahead for JE!

Let me get this straight, President Juncker feels betrayed? Right! After 5 months of marathonian negotiations, while the GR government has already abandoned a lot of the red lines it had drawn before the elections in order to reach an agreement, the institutions gave the GR government a painfully asphyxiating "take it or leave it" ultimatum. Now, the government decided to take it to the people and hold a national referendum before issuing the legislation and the EC/ECB guys refused to extend the bailout for one week, in order for the referendum to take place and the Greeks to remain unaffected and unencumbered and HE feels betrayed. Wow! And for a moment there I was really worried about those guys! I was worried whether it is moral or not to vote NO, because let's be honest it's like pulling the trigger to a gun which is pointed at them too. Well, after the last few hours and their reactions towards this DEMOCRATIC decision of  the GR government, next Sunday I will definitely vote NO!  

175077
Is there some reason why investors in the bond market didn't see this happening?  Now, think about it.  When twenty-five percent of the population works for the government, unemployment is extremely high; college graduates do not return home and professional and entrepreneurial people migrate to the mainland, what do you think?  What does Puerto Rico produce or export?  In essence, everything of any value is leaving.  And you are investing there?<br/><br/>If you have been buying the bonds of Puerto Rico for their triple-tax exemptions, please go to E R and have your head examined.  Also, you really should challenge your broker if he/she recommended such securities.  Investing in  a company that books ships that don't make it back to port is surely not a "cruise" that you want to be on.  If you have been directed into such investments, chances are the broker--and the firm--were acting in their best interests--NOT YOURS!<br/><br/><a href="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">http://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a>

Seriuosly, you can't imagine political incompetence of this nature? That would require either very selective or very short-term memory! Think Vietnam in the 1960's, Iraq in the 2000's, and Syria now.

Does anyone doubt that narrative? Yes, including the authors of the seven prior Benghazi! Benghazi! Benghazi! investigations, including the ones written by Republicans.

Really,  Richard? Your hatred is an insult to all of those who died fighting for the US. Puerto Rico used to be a very strategic military base. Puerto Rico was one of the first European colonies in America, older than the US, because of its strategic location. How ungrateful!

Why all of the vituperation and hatred for Republicans in these comments? At one time, before the rise of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Republicans were the party of liberals and drew the votes of most African-Americans, who were allowed to vote. The Democrats and "Dixiecrats" were the party of racism, segregation, Strom Thurmond and Jim Crow.<br/><br/>That all changed with the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which were universally opposed by southern Democrats and "Dixiecrats." L.B.J. may have won major victories in his campaign to make Civil Rights for all Americans a reality, but he had to constantly fight the Democrats/Dixiecrats to get the job done!

Why don't we promote sleeping like the Japanese?<br/><br/>I tried to do the "right" thing with my first kid.  I lost so much sleep getting up and down during the night.  Trying to fall back to sleep after fully waking like that is hard!  And then there was the problem of moving (and therefore rousing) a kid who was in a drowsy stupor from nursing and getting him back in the crib.  Miserable.<br/><br/>I needed my second kid not to wake the first during the night.  I needed more sleep to deal with a toddler and an infant alone all day.  I kept a mattress on the floor in the center of the nursery and fell asleep nursing with my head resting on my arm instead of a pillow.  The kid learned to fall asleep lying flat.  I broke the latch when he was done and rubbed his back to settle him (so he wouldn't need to nurse to fully fall asleep).  He transitioned to his own bed like a champ.  He'd sometimes crawl into our bed at night as a 3-5 year old, but often we'd barely waken.<br/><br/>To this day he's more of a cuddler than the first.   Makes me sad...

175663
Do we blame the 21 states with GOP governors who brought on this lawsuit or do we look for the real culprits in this?<br/><br/>That is right, you, my progressive friends are to blame for this!<br/><br/>You think those local and state elections are not as "important" as that once every four year election for president.<br/><br/>Well guess what, this ruling shows how wrong you are.<br/><br/>Because, do you think for a moment that any of this would have happened if you took seriously those "unsexy" local and state elections?  <br/><br/>So, stop blaming the conservative justices on the SOCTUS or GOP lawmakers or big business interests - blame yourself for being lazy, unengaged and staying home on election day. 

175831
You think the IMF is complicit in Greece's problems??? The IMF is just taxpayers like you and me. And WE are the biggest holders of Greek Debt with the EU being the second biggest. Two central banks just trying to help Greece develop a functioning economy. Instead Greece took the money and squandered it. Their exports actually fell dramatically when they joined the common currency (they were already part of the trade zone). The problem in Greece is culture and most especially 40 years of corrupt government!!

What alternate universe does De Blasio and crew live in?  De Blasio currently rents out his house - AT MARKET RATE.  Will he be freezing rents??? NO!   Everyone who owns a two family house or a 40 unit building has expenses that go up every single year.  How can you possibly tell someone they can't raise rent?  That is utter folly.  That is how we got ghettos in the first place.  So what - will you fine building owners if they don't make repairs because there is no financial gain in doing so?  If that's the case then call it what it is - "public housing in private hands".  There is a reason many building owners are selling out to larger and larger concerns.  Contrary to what many think - they don't have the cash to sit and wait and not make money.<br/>What I think should happen is the city encourage more lower income co-ops.  When people have ownership and have to feel the brunt of maintenance and improvements - they have a VERY different outlook.  I've done work with some and I know.  They soon become just like "the evil landlord" and want to get rid of others who "bring down" the property.

Don't like how things are done here? Don't like New York City's social contract? Maybe you preferred things when our leaders were in bed with real estate speculators and developers.

Did someone call this an "eye rhyme"? POSER-LOSER, NOI, AMOI?  What is it when one word is inside another, like  ANTS-ANTIS? And what is a SERIOcomic?

One of my staff is vegan, so I called ahead each night to be sure our intended restaurant had options for him. At one place he ordered the "vegetarian plate" which is 3 side dishes as your meal. Each came liberally sprinkled with real pieces of bacon. I complained to the waitress about the meat in the veggies and she replied, "Honey child, bacon isn't meat, bacon is a seasonin'!

Hi, did you see the Redheaded guy who beat that guy up in front of Frank after they rear-ended him?  I think Frank sent him to Ray's wife to rape and beat her and then gave Ray a fake name because it was someone Frank wanted dead. So Ray probably did NOT kill the rapist back in 2006 !!!  That redhead probably was the rapist (for Frank) so he could "own" Ray !  The kid is a redhead !!  what do you guys think?

I cannot vouch for this, but I did hear a knowledgeable person comment on TV that during this last period no landlords (at least of rent stabilized apartment buildings) have had to declare bankruptcy or file for hardship increases (if such is available???). Landlords are certainly entitled to a decent return on their property, but the allowable percentage of increases year after year for so long has certainly rewarded them handsomely while so many struggle to meet each new increase. We can only hope that the landlords do not "take it out" on their tenants. Let us enjoy at least this one- or two-year lease breather!

Can he win?<br/><br/>Absolutely. I think he has better odds of beating Hillary than any other Repulican candidate. And the democrats know it. That's why MSNBC evening commentators went on for months with such glee over the GWB scandal - and now they will be back. (Just watch Rachel Maddow the next few weeks.) <br/><br/>But politics aside, what kind of president would he be? In my life time (and I'm Christie's age) we have never had a brash, outspoken, even rude President. Our presidents are generally all politically correct. I don't know if we should change that. Heck, why not!  At least it will not be boring.

This comment is what makes SCOTUS decisions by the Catholic Five so crazy-making:  they are actually so conservative that they hark back to the feudal era of lords and serfs, redefining corporations as the lords and everyone else as serfs.  But they often present their rulings as ones which add to individual freedom, which is completely nuts.  Making them look even worse is their 6-year-old petulance when they lose a particular argument, which is especially poor behavior in men past the age of consent.

What model is that? Backpackers only? (And would you have the park rangers inspect the packs for solar powered coffee grinders and wifi hubs?) <br/><br/>Your motto should perhaps be National Parks for the park rangers only!<br/>I'm too old to take up backpacking but I do enjoy leaving the car or tour bus for a short hike that is still within my physical capabilities. I'm willing to deposit my bowel movements in the woods if that will make you happy, but I doubt it will. <br/><br/>I look forward to heavy lift drones that will deposit me and my recliner atop Half Dome.

'Dear Krugman, could you please ban those Germans who post their non-sense every three minutes?'<br/><br/>Dear Krugman - as a German with an American passport I'm begging you to ban all these American who constantly post all this nonsense about the Greek Crisis. - or actually NOT - don't ban them - Let them write more - we need their help for our ' Awesome Gratuitousness of the Greek Crisis' - or what did my Greek Cousins tell me just a few minutes ago over skype; If somebody wants to hit himself with a big piece of pie - show empathy and eat the pie of his face! 

177973
And i don't know if it is gratuitousness if now everybody is hardening her or his stance? -<br/>And it reminds me a bit on American families where the Republican parts are absolutely hating their Democrat parts... but with a much less balanced distribution of sympathy - in the US it's about fifty-fifty while in Europe it's eighteen against one -<br/>I mean eighteen countries against one - plus Paul Krugman and his fans - and I'm really torn if this is 'awesome' or not?<br/>And as the mood goes - today I hope Paul Krugman will be right the first time right with his wishful thinking about the Greece Crisis in the spirit of my favorite economical model: <br/><br/>'Protect me from what I want!

How is this even a "critique?" It has no cogent message or argument. Oh, the Pope is against birth control, as a Catholic. Whoop-dee-do, so profound!<br/>No, it's just dumb.

I wonder if the IMF can be sued for the damages caused by the economic policies that they forced on the Greeks? I think the world would benefit greatly from such a precedent. It is now clear that all the justifications that the IMF had to support their decisions were constructed by highly biased selection of the scientific evidence. It is disgraceful and it should be pointed out for the world to be a safer place! Hough!!

Could you imagine the GOP Dream Ticket for 2016:  Chris Christie and Donald Trump…or, is that Donald Trump and Chris Christie?  It would be like a Three Stooges episode.  I wanna be on top!

Who is the Property and Environment Research Center?<br/>Is it a tax-advantaged entity? A non-profit? Are there charitable deductions for contributing to it or to the several organization that fund it?<br/><br/>Do the Koch brothers support it with money (the Koch Foundation, for example)? Hello, what a surprise, the answer seems to be yes!<br/><br/>How about this? Eliminate all charitable deductions: they benefit the rich, not the poor. And the rich use their deductions for junk like this article. <br/><br/>And of course let funding for our national parks be determined by who can afford to pay fees. Hey, Disneyland may be the only national park left under this brilliant design. Yuck!

Christie runs on Truth?! Really? To put it as crudely as he would, the man wouldn't know Truth if it jumped up and bit him in the butt.<br/><br/>Oh, wait. I've got in now. Chris Christie is running ON Truth, as in having knocked it down and trampled it into the dust. Yeah, that's about right.

Why does the NYTIMES print everything they can to offend Christians and not the "religion of peace"?<br/>Let's do the math:<br/>Chances of Christians retaliating in a violent way - 0.0001 %<br/>Chances of the "religion of peace" retaliating in a violent way - almost 100 %<br/>Offending Christians takes zero courage.  (And let's be honest, the NYTIMES likes to offend Christians so it's a double bonus.  They get to pretend that their "art" is somehow cutting edge and edgy AND they will pay absolutely no cost.  Can't say that about offending other groups nowadays!!)

Is Christianity losing its grip because values are changing, or is it more because those values are riddled with hypocrisy?  Christians preach about the sanctity of life, yet so many seem to have no problem whatsoever about the death penalty!  The Bible exalts the poor, yet so many Christians have no problem ignoring the poor!  <br/><br/>Christianity is NOT the national religion (we supposedly don't have one), yet evangelicals would make it so.  The Bible may preach against gays, but it was written in a time when they could not possibly have understood what being gay really meant, or the extent to which it exists, and probably existed even then.  We know with some certainty that such a vacuum in knowledge existed when we hear all these claims that the earth is only 5,000 years old.  The proposition that being homosexual was "an abomination" was something born out of fear of the unknown, not out of understanding.  <br/><br/>The Bible says homosexuals should be put to death!  Now, that's a nice piece of Christian thinking isn't it!  What it really is compares more to voodoo than anything.  <br/><br/>Christianity is a good thing if you look to the basic teachings, such as honesty, compassion, and love thy neighbor as yourself.  However, when you take the Bible, and start "cherry picking" it's contradictory content, you start losing people who have the power to think.  It's not so much that those basic teachings are lost, but orgnaized religion starts to lose its appeal.

Post-Christian nation?! I don't think so David. But this was written for your  Evangelical Christian friends and their worldview. There are those who don't belong to that sect (and surprise - many of us who don't belong also don't vote Republican) who find the latest court decisions as a 'it's about time' moment and doesn't threaten their christian worldview.  But the SCOTUS decision on capital punishment must given them and may you too David a certain warmth in your 'loving' hearts.

How do we know anything written in the Old and New Testament is true?  Both these books were written by men years after the so-called occurrences.  They should not be taken literally, or as "truth". We don't know what Jesus said, if anything.  We can't be sure he even existed.  The motto for all should be:  DO THE RIGHT THING!  One shouldn't need a book to figure that out; that's what your conscience is for.

180335
So was the "STEEP" drop in fuel coupled with a steep drop in insurance rates? Or a steep drop in property taxes?  Or a steep drop in other utilities?!  You wrote there was no reason to raise rents because expenses didn't go up but only named one expense.  Renters don't see the whole picture and is probably why they rent in the first place.

180338
Next they should freeze grocery prices, clothing prices and vehicle prices?!?! This is a complete JOKE! Why should the working guy down the hall who just moved in pay 3 times for the same apt, what an old tenant pays? Does this theory apply to any other business in the USA? Rental housing is a PRIVELEDGE not a RIGHT! No one is owed an affordable apartment in midtown just because they decided they want one... I want a Mercedes too for $300 a month, am I owed that too? Just another entitlement and you dare say the landlord is Greedy? SHAME SHAME SHAME

If "austerity" didn't work for 5 years, why does Merkel think it will work at all in the future? <br/><br/>To insist Greece take loans AND more "austerity" measures, which are exactly the reasons that Greece cannot pay its debts, is the kind of Merkel-led, bone-headed move, equivalent to what the GOP insisted on doing when the $&amp;!t hit the economic fan here in 2008, that fortunately the US (led by then President-Elect Barack Obama) didn't fall for. <br/><br/>We went for stimulus (still too small, again sabotaged by the GOP) and now we are far, FAR better off than the Euro Zone that is still anemic after two Germany-led austerity measures since 2008.

180754
Why? Here's an example of a less egregious and more silly "diagnosis" our elementary school nurse made. My then 3rd-grade daughter was prone to nosebleeds, and the ENT doctor she'd seen had said "Yes. I see a little vein very near the surface. Don't poke you finger in there too hard, ok, honey?". The end. But the school nurse who had to mop her up one day when it started in class called me to say, "There was way too much blood for that to be a normal nosebleed. In fact, the reason she is so pale (it was February, as I recall) is from a loss of blood. I want a letter from her doctor stating she has been examined!" I asked my daughter if she felt alright, or if it had been a worse than usual nosebleed. She chuckled and said no, but Nurse Jones had gotten very upset. I did call our pediatrician. She suggested our school get a new nurse.

Kurt -- as to "So you believe that increasing solar + wind capacity will result in a reduction in global CO2 emissions, and ultimately, a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration? Care to take a stab at when that will transpire?"<br/><br/>Reduction of CO2 emissions compared to no solar+wind has always been true.  <br/><br/>Reduction of CO2 emissions for major nations deploying wind and solar (and improved efficiency measures) are happening right now too: US CO2 emissions have been dropping, so have emissions from many European nations.<br/><br/>I am now optimistic that global CO2 emissions will peak before 2030.  This assumes that the Paris round produces further tangible commitments, that China keeps to its stated commitment.  <br/><br/>As to when atmospheric CO2 concentrations will peak, and what that peak will be ... I am less optimistic.  <br/><br/>What's your point? It seems to be "to hell with the future, party on!"

Are we to believe that both ends of the GW Bridge act in revenge and vindictiveness when in comes to the behavior of their respective Governors?  NAAAAAA!<br/><br/>Why hasn't the other shoe dropped in Bridgegate with NYS investigating and bringing possible criminal charges against newly minted GOP hopeful Gov. Chris Christie?  Could a deal have been struck between the two Governors; it sure would explain allot.<br/><br/>Gov.  Cuomo's star is falling, there is no political path for him, his chances of Elected Federal Office (ie President) has about as much chance as Gov. Christie which is to say "not much".  Even the prisons are corrupt in NYS, let alone NYS's Legislative Branch, and he look like a clown in NNY, handling a 22 day prison break out from Clinton Correctional by convicted murders and their subsequent capture<br/><br/>While Mayor de Blasio's path is clear, clean up Rikers and NYC, make NYC hum again, place safety and justice for all NYers at the top of list and watch NYC transform itself into the greatest place on the planet as it has done so many times before.<br/><br/>While Mayor de Blasio's task is daunting its no where near the dead-end of  Gov. Cuomo's and Gov. Christie's.  Hopefully he did not politically miscalculate Gov. Cuomo propensity for political combat and the damage he may cause, Gov. Cuomo is still a very formable foe capable of the most ruthless political warfare, just like Gov. Christie.

Right?????   Wrong!!!!  Corporations will support the confederate flag, they will decry the confederate flag.  Corporations will support guns, they will decry guns.  Corporations will support climate change, they will deny climate change.    All depending on which way the wind is blowing.  What they won't do is limit the salaries of corporate officers and the dividends of corporate stockholders in order to pay workers a living wage.  It's not the sunny side of greed, it is simple greed.

How on earth can any system of care that requires it's caregivers, even in training, to persistently and aggressively violate every standard of well being and health (by regularly logging insane hours) viably call itself a "healthcare" system?  You all want to know understand the appeal of "alternative" health? It's the fact that many of the so called alternative practitioners actually at least appear to make an effort to model and protect basic principles of healthily living. I have a dear friend in her third year of medical school who literally works 89 hours a week. She's chronically exhausted, using all kinds of unhealthy tactics to stay awake and somewhat alert, and is compromising her own health to satisfy a requirement that violates every basic known tenet of self care that she exposes to her patients. It's a fraudulent and ego serving system in this way. This hypocrisy is one of the reasons I rarely think of any western medical professional as more than a technician. I use western medicine to fix broken parts as needed and for drugs as needed (they are masters of that arena!) but I never take healthcare advice from a western physician; that's laughable!

If you only earn $21,000 a year, how can you justify retiring at 50? Those Greek pensions were relatively luxurious too! The problem is wanting expensive Swedish style benefits, but paying taxes like you lived in Somalia.

Does this rift have something to do with the Central Park horse drawn carriages? As I recall the mayor wanted them gone and the gov said no way. I feel for New Yorkers who live outside the NYC metro area. The Big Apple is so, well, BIG that it's power crushes the rest of New York - most of which suffers great economic distress because it just can't compete with the part of the country (see: South Carolina) where taxes are low, public service unions are weak, and Progressive politics are a non-starter.<br/><br/>With de Blasio, as with every other NYC mayor, it's all about "The City" - easily the richest city in the US. Despite its wealth and thanks to its litigation, legislative skills and teacher union support the rest of NYS has to subsidize NYC's schools while the burbs are crushed under confiscatory property taxes. So glad I moved! 

182987
Seriously?! De Blasio is just grinding his ideological axe again here. His populist progressivism-at-all-costs policies are also hurting the city. Just another politician throwing stones in their very own glass house.

Now this guy, who ran as a far left looney wants to make a deal after missing his obligations?  Seriously? He was such a tough guy before and now he's willing to take a deal? No way!  You get the representation that you vote for and its about time that they got shoved out of the Euro.  They don't properly collect taxes on their citizens and then pay our ridiculous pensions to people who retire at 50 for the rest of their lives.

as a wisconsinite who loves my state, i have to ask new jersey citizens the same question i ask my fellow wisconsinites:  they why the heck do the people of your state keep electing and re-electing these nuts?  we progressives need to do a much, much better job of ousting these candidates who appeal to the elderly, retired Fox news watchers.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with the democratic party of wisconsin, which had three tries to defeat scott walker, but through sheer incompetence was unable to do so.  like chris christie, scott walker has thrown our state into chaos--we are last in the nation for job growth--but our democratic party can't muster the votes to unseat the guy?  <br/><br/>the fault is with our own state political parties.  we need to clear the decks of all of the party cronies collecting their paychecks (from our donations) and put some smart folks into the party who will help get out the vote in the metropolitan areas.  enough is enough!  we must heal our state parties rom within in order to change things.

Jon, please tell us what the arrangements were that children were raised under in the past? Gay marriages? single moms? come on! those are very modern situations!<br/><br/>It used to be if your mother was single (or even widowed), you were lucky to  go off to an orphanage.<br/><br/>No matter how you want to spin this, lefty-wise, it still takes ONE man and ONE woman to create a child -- and childbirth outside of marriage used to be frowned on pretty hard by almost everyone (even liberals). So yes, most children used to be raised by their real mother and their real father.<br/><br/>Note: it is not that "two is a magical number". It's that it takes ONE man and ONE woman to create a new human life -- so having 5 same sex parents is still not as a good as "your real mom and your real dad".

185692
I think the Post probably imagines they are making the 'liberal' NY Times "look bad", with a secret history of racism but really, does their conservative ownership and readership really want to foment a revolution that may lead to a very expensive renovation of the Times Square subway station?  Aren't they anti-tax?<br/><br/>Maybe they are hoping to have the Times run out of town on a rail by anti-racism activists and have the Square renamed - Post Square, anyone?<br/><br/>I hear NYDN is up for sale, too.  We can become a one newspaper city!

185803
The big economic question, micro and macro is: how much debt is good, and how much debt is too much?  Conservatives seem to think almost all debt is bad.  But it is the propulsive fuel for capitalism.  There needs to be a little debt, a little inflation, and a little frowth for capitalism to survive.  (I wonder if it also requires popultation growth as part of that equation.)<br/><br/>The U.S. debt seems very healthy right now.  It should go up in certain periods, and down in others.  Keynes nailed all that.  So moralism about debt by Conservatives is a lot like moralism about sex by fundamentalist Christians: exaggerated, absolutist, Medieval, and wrong.  To be healthy one needs a little of each every month, but not so much that it crowds out productivity.<br/><br/>Funny how we used to criticize the Greeks for their lack of limits to sexuality too!

Lobsterfest pays you to eat at Red Lobster? gee, tell me how that works!<br/><br/>You are of course free to boycott anyplace, just as Franklin Graham is free to do so. I read about lefty liberals boycotting Walmart, Disney, Chik Fil A, Hobby Lobby etc. on almost a daily basis.

Exploitation?  Internship was always an opportunity to put one's education into direct action in the real world, with supervision.  "Scut" such as drawing blood, putting in IVs, were necessary skills to learn because doctors actually did them in regular practice.  You had to do it intensely for a couple of years, with long hours at relatively low pay, because you got something educational out of it, and in return you helped keep the cost of health care down with your (relatively) cheap labor.  All of that with the knowledge that you wouldn't have to do all of that and work like that for most of the rest of your career.  ("Have the resident do that." would be the refrain.)<br/><br/>Fast forward to a time where resident's hours are limited and they do not have basic mechanical skills.  Who is m aking up for those fewer hours?  The attendings!  Who is performing the lost skills?  NPs, PAs, and anesthesiologists--for which a much higher premium is paid.  Postgraduate medical trainees will come out of their training to a real world where they may have to work harder than they had to in their training, and learn to do things they didn't learn to do in training.

186017
You donate to political parties?!  Crazy.

What makes you poor, then? what is poverty? Because it used to be having not enough to eat, and wearing raggedy clothing. But today, that is unknown -- 15% of the poorest of our population get food stamps so generous, they can sell the extras to get spending cash! and clothing is so massively imported, that even at thrift stores you can buy quality clothing in like-new condition for a dollar or two.<br/><br/>If you have lots of food -- nice clothing -- 100% free health care via Medicaid -- your air conditioned apartment with wi fi and cable is subsidized by the taxpayers, so you pay maybe $50 a month rent -- and you have a huge flat screen HDTV which you bought with the extra food stamps you didn't need -- and of course, your free Obamaphone with Obama minutes -- please tell me how you are poor. What are your privations? what exactly is it you are not getting?

186952
From another perspective - why do we choose to label "black" and "white"?  Just by connotation white suggests purity, black dark and scary. What race are you? Caucasian, Native American, African American, etc.  Given that, so many of us are multiracial with diluted ethnic genealogy that it is impossible to attach a label.  As long as we separate ourselves by race, religion, etc., there will be tension.  We are human beings. Period. Understanding and respecting the 'other' is the common denominator.  Wouldn't hurt to work on that a bit!

So the implication is, that a book you read over 50 years ago explains race today?! Race relations today have advanced tremendously in the last 50 years.  Are they perfect? Of course not. But I think when people make all white people guilty of racism, and all blacks victims of racism, they distort the truth.  They also perpetuate racial tensions and problems.

188322
And what positives come out of these "conversations"?  Whining and complaining about how you are abused?  Not very postive!!  I really think you and they live in a land that does not exist except in their own minds.  Nobody is persecuted in this country due to their race, nobody is discriminated against due to their race.  Surely not every day of their lives as babies have none of these things being possible.

188374
hi<br/>that's a tough one, but will try to answer<br/>the short answer is, they keep electing corrupt politicians, because they are mostly selfish, uneducated (politics/finance) and believe 'others can do the task, so why shall they bother themselves ?'<br/>And this time they voted again out of anger and not because they had a clue what Mr Tsipras was saying.<br/>But i guess this  no novelty. Many nations citizens hardly have a clue who and why they vote for.<br/><br/>'find home in London' an many other places Virgin islands, Belize, Paris etc.<br/>Well these are about 3000 people, permitted (by previous governments) to 'drain' the country's resources, and the ones, this government is after !

188434
@Steve Bolger<br/><br/>"When people go around with chips on their shoulders, aren't they asking to have the chips brushed off?"<br/><br/>The problem is that the NY Times only attacks specific groups.  Do you think the NY Times would publish a cartoon that mocks Hilary Clinton?  Because she certainly deserves it!

188515
But it's fine to have normal relations with China, where people are put to death for tax fraud?!<br/>But you of course couch your arguments in favor of the 'western hemisphere;'  it's OK that to sign treaties with Communist China, these days the world headquarters for Walmart, but it's wrong to post an ambassador 90 miles from Miami?  Ridiculous.

188792
Why is it always alright to offend Christians and Catholics anywhere? The media disguises their hatred and phobia by claiming they are merely reporting om art or culture. However, they would not dare to offend a group, where their extremists kill more people all over the world every day; in our time. If they are going to offend, then do so equally!

Over the years that the late, great, pre-crash GM was accumulating debt, and its share price rising, regardless, while it sold bonds to raise cash for numerous costs, I asked friends, and business acquaintances what I thought was a very straightforward business question: why would one lend money to GM when it showed no obvious means to pay down the debt it already had and was operating under management that had no plan to change that?<br/><br/>GM failed during the crash, in its way, but GM was doomed anyway.<br/><br/>And I have the same question regarding Puerto Rico, and have had watching it lay on debt: why were lenders giving it money and why was it being allowed to borrow?<br/><br/>$72 billion? Puerto Rico? In the immortal words of Mr. McEnroe, Are you kidding! You can't be serious!<br/><br/>There's an investigative project for a NYTs reporter.<br/>.

Haven't we learned from the Financial Crisis that debt is not good???<br/><br/>Congress should not allow Puerto Rico to issue any more debt !<br/><br/>Puerto Rico must run a balanced budget.<br/><br/>The same is true for Illinois, Chicago &amp; the United States.<br/><br/>Governments love borrowing money &amp; spending it to get reelected.<br/><br/>This has to stop.

So what's the solution?  All white people are tagged as being racist or having the urge within them.  All blacks are labeled as victims of whites.  What solution can there be to solve this?  What would it take to move on?  All we do by discussing this issue is teach young children, who are not racist, that we have a racism problem.  Black children begin to see whites as oppressors and all white children now think they are racist.  They cycle will never end and even if you eliminated all whites, racism would not disappear, it would shift.  Racism is not limited to one group of people.  The sad reality is that while we discuss this topic, black children are killing each other in black neighborhoods, it's a crisis!  Guess what, this conversation is irrelevant to the dead - how about we do something about the youth being slaughtered.  Let's talk about strengthening our families, let's stop blaming and creating victims for political gain so we can see some real progress, save real lives.

"but hospitals? More smokers = more business!”<br/><br/>Wildly irresponsible statement.  Hospitals lose money on repeat hospitalizations of patients with chronic lung disease...from smoking...and these people are repeat customers. Many of these patients are disabled and on Medicare--which doesn’t pay out much.  They take up valuable bed space.<br/><br/>Hospitals make money with trauma, especially car collisions.Why?  Because car insurance is MANDATED.  Trauma brings in top surgeons and anesthesiologists -the two most highly compensated specialties in medicine.<br/><br/>Surgery suites are used, ICUs are filled.

Well, gosh, who could *possibly* have predicted this might happen?<br/><br/>Let's keep in mind that these robber barons spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the government to be deregulated, and since that's happened, every single time that there has been the SLIGHTEST blip in their earnings, they have immediately come whining to the government for a taxpayer funded bailout. They were simply handed BILLIONS right after 9/11. Billions!<br/><br/>A disgusting group of money-grubbing companies, bleating about the "free market" while colluding to monopolize air travel, and charging extra for every little item that was once included while at the same time ticket prices keep rising.<br/><br/>In less than a decade, they will have installed pay toilets on every flight.

Isn't this missing the obvious point, once you step back and ask yourself what are we really talking about?<br/><br/>The county data finds a 3% higher state-of-marriage in "red" counties. Okay. Assume the link is causal, and then ask yourself what is it about "red"-county culture that might cause more of the people to be/stay/get married?<br/><br/>It's kind of a "duh" question, isn't it? Conservative culture can be said (by liberals) to coercively induce people toward marriage. Don't like the word "coercive"? Point taken, but consider who we are talking about - we are talking about the 3% of married people (in a red county) that, were they in a blue county, would have opted to end the marriage.<br/><br/>Now ask yourself, regardless of how much better off teenagers are in the average - or mean - married household, how much better off are teenagers in a household that is just holding on to that marriage via the help/pressure/support/scorn of the surrounding environment?<br/><br/>Not nearly as well as the mean!<br/><br/>The problem here is the assumption that a married household is a better household, even as we all know examples of married households that are dysfunctional and more destructive to most, or all, the members than if the couple declare the relationship bankrupt and attempt to build a better home for themselves and their children. A community that supports that decision is better than one that applies dogmatic pressure to conform to a supernatural norm. Period. And these studies are not measuring that.

Because it was part of a war bounty,  have u heard of the Spanish-American War of 1898????  PR is the last of the gained territories - we also had The Philippine Islands Cuba and I believe Guam -- so they did not ask to be with us - we have forced them and we have mismanaged our duties as a colonial power! <br/><br/>Madoff??? Seriously??? Scheme??? Read the article - the island has suffered a massive de-industrialization process bc of the federal gov inability to understand that such econonomy (which we Americans created in PR) needs subsides simply for basic reasons!   There is no scheme - there is an honest "this is not politics, this is math" I wish our leaders were this honest!!! Don't feel sheltered by ur notions of how others may be - we as Americans are not too far from such things - we spend 3.7 trillion which we manage w a 600 billion deficit - and borrow to pay interest on our debt - that's like using ur Amex to pay for ur Visa!  Think!

Why did the rescue package fail in Greece? The reasons are manifold, but what is conveniently ignored by most pundits is the fact that the Greek state does not have the means to implement a restructuring program. On paper Greece does have the institutions required for a modern democracy but they are bloated, ineffective and corrupt serving the special interests of the elites. I have lived under such a system for many years in Brazil. After a while you will either leave the country or become a cynical bystander. In any case you will try to escape the harassment by the bureaucracy and ever increasing taxation. Circumventing regulations, paying bribes and cheating on taxes is a matter of survival as is the expatriation of any savings.<br/>Without a radical realignment of government on all levels any additional rescue funds will simply perpetuate the current situation in Greece. As there is no consensus in Greek society to reform the current system chances of meaningful structural reforms are illusory. So whatever side you are on - the austerity or the Keynesian side - it does not matter. Greece is doomed either way.<br/>If I were a Greek Millennial I would vote 'όχι' in the referendum - no, no no!. Greece has no other choice but to go through a purgatory of default. Out of the ashes of this total and devastating collapse might eventually - probably only after a generation or two - rise a modern Greece. The harshness of this process will create the consensus for a functioning society.

In a world filled now with refugees of all kinds and knowing that the United States failed to accept these children when asked to do so by Winton, is it then so strange to hear too many Americans applaud Donald Trump about "illegal" immigrants and "Mexican" criminals? Apparently too many of us are no different today than we were back then!<br/>The man is a saint. Some self-identified G-D-fearing Christians and Jews of America need learn from him!

Why would Democrats care about the Cuban-American vote? They've been reliably Republican supporters for decades, while almost all other Hispanic voters resent the special treatment and benefits given to Cubans coming to America (especially when you compare the poverty and lack of opportunity in nations like Honduras or Guatamala, as opposed to the relatively safe and secure lives Cubans have with no drug gangs, excellent public education and excellent public health)!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, those same Republicans, most lately typified by Donald Trump, perpetually attack, insult and bad mouth non-Cuban Hispanics, who have as a result become increasingly supportive of the Democrats (despite the fact that the number of undocumented aliens has actually declined under Obama, a first in decades, and despite the fact Obama has had more undocumented aliens deported than any President before him).<br/><br/>And don't worry, there are millions of us, after living literally 50 years watching the failed policies concerning Cuba, have absolutely no problem with Mr. Kerry seeing those views at MY (taxpayer's) expense (always amuses me how frequently Republicans believe only they are paying taxes).

Are the creditors to blame, too? Sure, the cuts after the financial crisis that were meant to balance the budget cut heavily into the economy, that relies so heavily on government spending.<br/>But Greece did not work on the other side of the deal, increasing tax income. The big shipping lines, the biggest businesses in Greece, are still exempt from every tax. This has not changed under Tsipras and why should it? The executive of his coalition partner and deputy prime minister married into one of the big shipping families! Greeks tax offices have just started to look at the list of tax evaders, again, after it sat untouched for years. And while you are at it, read up on how land ownership works in Greece. These things have been in the works since the independence in the 19th century. The promised privatizations to generate cash? Did not happen either. The list goes on and on. To sum it up, there have been promises, but little action on the part of Greece.<br/>Just to offer a different perspective, Slovakia was heavily hit by the financial crisis and decided to resolve it themselves. They opted out of all programms, did their homework and paid for Greece as well. And somehow - must be a miracle - it worked.<br/>And now we have reached the end of the line, what feels like 10 last chances were offered, stimulus packages, too. But no, everything was unacceptable. Strange how everyone agreed despite Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland having similar problems.<br/>Quite frankly, we have had it!

Why do extremists always call the left wing's ideology "radical" but call the right wing's ideology "conservative?"  Right wingers are as radical and extreme as they come.  There is nothing conservative about them!<br/>Cuomo did not save the city.  He is a spineless fish who didn't have the chestnuts to debate Teachout.

Is it Saturday?  Wow, that was hard!  And I had trouble getting a toe hold--finally UDON got me going a bit.  So many possible answers to each clue!  SERF, PEON?  No, PLEB.  DOTING?  No, LOVING.  SEAN or THOM O'Flaherty?  Nope.  AEOLIAN was perhaps the most evil answer/clue construction.<br/><br/>Had to ask the DHubby for a word beginning with F that meant STOOL PIGEON, and I already had INVISIBLE INK in the puzzle.  When he declared FINK! the nickel finally dropped--not that it helped me, because the clues all displayed a good deal of ECCENTRICITY.  Timothy Polin rocks!  And if I ever meet him, I hope I can throw one at him.

So this is progress--women taking the stereotypical role of pawing, panting horn dogs, and men playing the sex objects? Woo-hoo!<br/><br/>But sorry, this is 2015--we don't need to be coy about "homoerotic subtexts" anymore. Homoeroticism can come out of the closet now!

Loved this - as a ex-Chicagoan who came out West ("What? You have no subway?!?") I can relate to the author's amazement. The West is the most amazing place, but if I hadn't moved out here I would never have learned to drive. I never get over how magnificent and unique every place in the West is....all that space, sky, and light.

yes - economy is a science of make-believe - you get what you measure - but what about happiness ?<br/><br/>I think I read something about the value of native rainforest - ignored until people started putting a value on - maybe the carbon capture - or the potential for new drug discovery<br/><br/>since Bhutan put Gross National Happiness onto world consciousness, people have started wondering how to measure happiness<br/><br/>but happiness as peak pleasure is an ephemeral state, quickly satiated and replaced by disgust, e.g. after eating too much<br/><br/>peace/contentment can be surveyed - I just did one - so that is useful<br/><br/>but Free Enterprise - in that store disguised as a country - the USA - tends to regard dollar$ as the highest good - and advertisers constantly reinforce - 'imagine' what your life would be like it you had this 'NEW !' shiny toy - probably poorer<br/><br/>I just read - planning your retirement - better to be frugal and surrounded by friends - than rich and alone in a hotel room - like Howard Hughes with the long hair and fingernails - money is like shite - piled up it stinks - spread around it stimulates growth for many

Why is the New York Times giving this disgraced grifter a forum to repeat his unsupported claims?  Who cares what he has to say?  He is a person whose maximum importance was reached several years ago as a reliably loony right wing talking head on various TV shows — that is, before this paragon of Christian virtue cheated on his wife and then went to jail on campaign finance fraud charges.<br/><br/>All you really need to know about Mr. D'Souza is that he's a prop — in the employ of the hard right religious lobby, as valuable for his ethnic background as his professed Christianity, who used to receive a jaw dropping $1M for being president of a so-called "Christian college" with about 300 students, its "campus" located in a suite of offices near Wall Street.  Please!  Where's Mike Wallace and his camera crew when you need him?

Human beings can experience a range of emotions, so why do we limit ourselves to just a few?  To be fully human involves finding meaning in all our our experiences.  Yes, we should limit pain and suffering, but our society believes that anything that might lead to pain and suffering should be eliminated.<br/>Instead of finding news drugs to escape reality, we should use the arts to help us cope with difficulties.  That is why the Greeks loved tragic drama so much!<br/><a href="http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/24c.html" title="http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/24c.html" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/24c.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.bachelorsdegreeonline.com/blog/2011/10-greek-plays-that-are-essential-to-any-education/" title="http://www.bachelorsdegreeonline.com/blog/2011/10-greek-plays-that-are-essential-to-any-education/" target="_blank">http://www.bachelorsdegreeonline.com/blog/2011/10-greek-plays-that-are-e...</a>

A boil without corn and new potatoes? Never seen it! Sausage shows up occasionally, as do the whole heads of garlic that turn so sweet and spicy in the boil.<br/>If you're really looking for something different, I've recently been introduced to the addition of pineapple (of all things!) in a crawfish boil. Sounds crazy, but the sweet heat is undeniably delicious!

Cuba has soared?!  Where have you been?  Cuba is a disaster, its people have suffered for years, the only ones with any money or any standard of living are the soldiers and government employees.  They had some money for a while as Argentina gave them billions, but now Argentina had to pull out.  Is it any surprise at all Cuba came knocking on Obama's door?<br/><br/>Puerto Rico is as corrupt as it gets - although Greece is close.  If you start to build a building, you have to pay off locals.  Then, once you have your infrastructure in place, they come back and you owe more fees, inspection charges, and taxes before you can even put up walls.  <br/><br/>Drive through the country and see the unfinished buildings that have languished for over 15 years.  It is astounding, and only a small piece of the corrupt lairs that call themselves government.  Do not give us babble about how this is the fault of the US government or its policies.  

193855
"Who he really is"?  Based on this article that is getting harder and harder to determine.<br/><br/>But I think based on his actions while governor, and his recent statements on the campaign trail, we're pretty sure that he is just another delusional governor that thinks voters are dumb enough to vote for him in a national election when voters in their home states have serious doubts.<br/><br/>Walker, Jindal, Perry, Huckabee and Christie.  Seriously?!

194260
@ Mary<br/>• Cuba has soared?! Where have you been?<br/><br/>In Cuba, last visit in March.<br/><br/>• Puerto Rico is as corrupt as it gets.<br/><br/>You got THAT right!

To your last paragraph, is Greece made dependent on the Troika for other unknown reasons? If so, what are they? Is it punishment for sneaking into the Euro, or does the Euro benefit those that got them in in the first place? If Greece reverts to drachmas, the third-party detractors can only profit in drachmas.<br/><br/>Greece needs to come clean! Everything they do is an investment into the future. In ten years, they do not want to be in the same condition while everyone else is more modern.

Why should anyone care about one single instance? Everything else is doing great, and those of us who actually read this paper know how great everything is in Manhattan, as well as much of the rest of the nation.<br/><br/>Poor managers get replaced. Poor business plans get replaced. Businesses that don't do well while everyone else is growing roses... go out... then get replaced! Failure gets paved over, and replaced. Always has been that way, always will be.

Did anyone notice the one-sided, perhaps racist coverage offered by FOX?  We heard a tremendous amount about the England players and coach:<br/>Where they go to college,<br/>What the coach said about planned tactics<br/>Who is a rising star on their team<br/>What the coach is telling his players during the match<br/>The name Mark Sampson was mention at least 20 times.<br/>How England's players are "role models"<br/>What England's coach said after halftime <br/><br/>I think the Japanese coach was mentioned once, a comment about his beard!   Aren't the Japanese players human beings?  Have they gone to college, do they play professionally, have they played on the previous World Cup Team...?<br/><br/>Fox has a lot of homework to do before the final on Sunday.

Is everybody happy? Nahhhh!  Not if we can believe the news that three of the top selling prescription drugs are anti-depressants.  Prozac treats happiness as a matter of brain chemistry. <br/><br/>Etymology, however, shows it to be something else. Being happy as a clam  (since the early 19thC.) suggests it’s only a matter of security. But that’s only at high tide. For its only then that the clam enjoys relative safety , the water covering its  mud flat habitat and hiding it from scavengers.  At low tide, it stands revealed and ripe for the digging.  <br/><br/>Our founding fathers suggested a more aggressive approach by promising  not happiness, but its pursuit. We’ve been chasing it ever since, but to little avail.  <br/><br/>Real happiness derives from the Middle English hap, which in its original sense meant “good luck.” When things first happened, they entailed good fortune, later whatever befell you. Things occurred as happenstance or in a haphazard fashion.<br/><br/>You can’t make something that is a matter of chance happen.  A happy-go-lucky person is one who is quite happy to trust to luck. <br/><br/>Happiness is happening everywhere. An old Chinese proverb suggests you be happy, until happiness comes.  Perhaps.( per, “through chance”), it may then happen.  Looking for a real sense of well being? That’s more an attitude and less a matter of chance.

Why isn't President Obama standing up to Sudan and Bashir? If the previous 4 presidents did (and 3 of them Republicans!), why not Obama?  I don't understand.  What is his reasoning for not doing more? Reading about these people and children is unbearable, because there's nothing I can do to stop it. And writing one more blog, signing one more petition, asking one more time for my representative or senator to act, is numbing and feels futile. Would these people being black have anything to do with our lack of action? 

195070
You raise an important point, but are we really looking at the disappearance of humanity or simply the tendency of the infotainment media to focus totally on violence, destruction and generally bad behavior?  The latter is certainly the case with respect to violent crime in the US.  Don't get me wrong...there is no shortage of mayhem across the globe.  It's also entirely possible that the glorification of violence in the media begets more violence.<br/><br/>Depressing!

Who said anything about hating males? Not I certainly, nor others. <br/><br/>My favorite footballer is a huge centreback -who once upon a time in 2009-2010 in a UEFA Champions League match made an own goal for the opposite. One for  which he was hounded by press, fans and team &amp; staff.  <br/><br/>Being a well-known and popular defender, he took the heat because he knew he had let his team and himself  down.  Rule # 1 for a DEFENDER: Defend YOUR Goal! Period.  He apologized for his errors, and to this day has never headed or footed a goal for the opposite team...In short he, as Bassett should, knew and knows that in defense the buck or goal stops at the first to last defender-and that includes the keeper... <br/><br/>BTW, England's Lioness keeper bears partial responsibility for yesterday's loss because she did not stop Bassett's own goal.<br/><br/>Sport is a competition, not a ladies tea with card game. social event! Whether football or tennis, ruby or basketball it is played to win, not to kibitz.  Just as in any work environment, each player has his or her duties in whatever the position. If the player-no matter his/her gender- makes an error, his/her team suffers.  No wimps need apply, no matter the gender.<br/><br/>And if women want to play in the sport known as football, they must accept the rules and paly the matches as everyone does.<br/><br/>If you can't stand the heat, get out of the fire!<br/><br/>In sports as in life, there is no room for 'mistakes' and no room for excuses because of anything.  

195219
Too dense for analytical philosophy? Not patient enough for classical philosophy? Is pragmatism, ethics, or continental not central enough to your goal of using an education as an opportunity to take a massive, extended selfie? <br/><br/>Then by all means, step right up young ladies and gentlemen and drink from the shallowest academic cup on hand! <br/><br/>It will be riveting! It will confirm many of your narrow biases! And best of all, you'll be a laughing stock to both laymen and academics of virtually every other stripe imaginable - even in the humanities! Amazing!  <br/><br/>But wait! There's more! Not only will you squander an opportunity to connect with a deeper intellectual vein, or establish closer ties with those other intrepid scholars from various ethnic studies departments (i.e. college athletes in need of a good grade), but you'll also be broadcasting to the world of work that you're essentially worthless. So the value keeps coming, even after graduation! While most students have the racial meaning and privilege talks over a bong, in a hallway, late at night in a dorm - you'll get to do it in a classroom, with a mentally stunted associate professor at the helm! Yay! And everyone on the hiring end will know it too! <br/><br/>So if you like coffee, particularly serving it, by all means this might just be the course for you!    

195289
So all "whites" (whatever that means) are fungible? How crude a case of reductionism is that?<br/><br/>Imagine how many Times writers and philosophy professors have vested interest in seeing the world (and insisting we see it) in terms of the hegemonic categories of back and white. There is good reason why the categories are entrenched in our law -- they serve powerful special interests.<br/><br/>Until I came to the United States, I had no idea that I was white. And that was not for want of school friends who came from India, Africa and Asia. The idea of choosing friends on the basis of their skin color rather than their characters, charm, how exciting they were -- nothing could have seemed more absurd.<br/><br/>But here in the US, not a day goes by that a Times writer doesn't remind me that I am "white" and scold me about how I am part of a system of oppression of non-whites. The amazing thing is that I am apparently part of this vast conspiracy without even knowing it!<br/><br/>Don't the people who peddle this nonsense realize that when their colleagues don't hold them to more rigorous standard of evidence and logic they are condescending to them?  

195380
@Sarah<br/>Recently?<br/>The English men's team is decade after decade the most overrated team on the planet.  The orgy of exaggerated hype lavished on them by the English press every World Cup is ridiculous, and repulsive.<br/><br/>Too bad the Women's World Cup has no team (for good and bad) like the Uruguay men's team.<br/>I love the scrappy little guys/gals, even when they bite :-)<br/><br/>Congratulations to the English women.  They have every right to be proud.<br/><br/>Go USA!

Guess WHY Greece is going to be destitute forever? Because Greeks REFUSE TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY! This is society so ripe with corruption and tax evasion it is staggering.<br/><br/>Greece could handle it's debts, if it bothered to actually sort out it's economy. Crack down hard on tax evasion, start taxing wealthy businesses and so forth. But instead they try to play victims, complaining how they are not getting any of the relief money and being expected to sort out their mess.<br/><br/>Yes, they are not getting money now, because that money is there to pay the money they ALREADY SPENT. In frivolous amounts of staff for public services (500 cleaners for one ministry?), absurd level of monetary benefits (extra money for washing hands, forestry workers getting extra for outdoor works) , not taxing wealthy industries (biggest company with merchant ships paying something like 200k in taxes) and permitting ludicrous amounts of corruption without bothering to touch it (receipts not matching with amounts paid, receipts printed in 'training' status, receipts recycled during day, paying completely without receipts).<br/><br/>Honestly, this is mess Greeks made for themselves and it is quite right and proper that they also suffer for it.  They really deserve no sympathy.

I've tried dozens (scores?!) of guacamole recipes and never once saw any of they talk about including peas.  These recipes have included, besides avocados, chiles, cilantro and garlic, maybe onions, jicama, crab meat, serrano peppers, jalapeno papers, even grilled pine nuts.  Never peas.<br/>I suspect this recipe offered by NY Times is for the sake of promoting peas during the pea season.<br/>Like Dr. Seuss once wrote(?) in one of his famous books, "I won't eat peacamole, Sam I am, I won't eat it."

slavery was not "common" in old {Gaelic?  Milesian?} Ireland, and left unargued is why references to pearly white fair skin is "racist" - although I'd suggest semantic drift to you.<br/><br/>The references to white skin was likely mostly in contrast to freckled, i.e. fair skin unmarred by freckles.  Calling this racist is idiotic - and inevitable, perhaps, when a bunch of academics with no idea what they are talking about impose their narrative on 2500 years of Gaelic poetry!

And why is the businessman 'desperate'?<br/><br/>Because it ruined its economy AGAIN!!  Hasn't this 'businessman' been helped over and over again during a period of several decades only to spit on the creditors who have helped him?<br/><br/>This is their SIXTH default - would you really be surprised about a seventh?<br/><br/>The officials who allowed Greece into the EZ should either be sued or arrested.<br/><br/>Greece's track record of financial recklessness is just to obvious to have let them in.

195869
What are white people so afraid of, why can't they admit that their skin gives them privileges? They did not choose their parents! But neither did Black folks. If Blacks are expected to endure racism with stoic silence at least Whites could accept that they enjoy an entitled position that many Blacks haven't the slightest possibility of achieving. Especially, since  the dominate culture won't even come to the table for the discussion. The hostile comments that this gentle commentary generated saddens me. I had hoped that the election of Mr Obama had brought us to a new place. If this brilliant, quiet and reflective man is a threat to white people, there is little hope for reconciliation. Black people are patient and forgiving, but I fear not forever. 

195927
What austerity? 70% of the Greeks don't pay taxes and most of their companies as well! it has worked in Germany, in England and in a few Eastern European states. This is the problem with socialists and to some extent our Democrats, they spend more than they have and other people's money!

IMO we could raise the temp on the thermometers in the summer and lower in the winter, drive at 55 mph and SAVE quite a bit of oil... and we could raise the gas tax and put back public transit (with dedicated lanes -- drivers have got to suffer to learn  not to drive) -- so that not everyone has to have a car.

Why does "every woman have a right to a home free of pornography"?<br/><br/>Do men have a right to a home free of pornography? <br/><br/>There are many different types of pornography. How are we defining this (this should sound very familiar to anyone of "a certain age"!)? Are we talking still photos, video, pornographic/erotic writing (some call it literature), movies? Are we talking pictures from decades ago, in black &amp; white, "art house" stuff? Or are we talking the latest, silly, embarrassing bad "selfie" stuff? Or, anything in between? Are pictures of men porn? Are photos of naked people "porn"? Are the delightfully nude Classical statues at the Met pornographic? How about the luscious female figures in some of the Rubens paintings hanging on the walls in the European Painting section?<br/><br/>I was a small child at a time when people in this country could be arrested for owning pornography. There is no way I am returning to that era, or that kind of thinking.<br/><br/>I don't want to shock you, but more than a few women enjoy viewing, and reading, porn.

Perhaps the pages don't turn fast enough?  We all--presidents included--under estimate the starchy resistance and heavy fortitude of those pages.  Currently, our president, President Barrack Obama, felt that at each turn, and he is a good reader!  He's listened and learned from the elders as well, and yet, sadly, those pages remained obstinate;  but he's not alone.<br/><br/>Our president's words to black fathers was not a chastisement.  It was pragmatic set-up, a move--much more endearing than simply rhetorical condensation--to protect his king so that he might speak with pen ready against the mass incarceration of black-American men.  <br/><br/>President Obama began a dialogue, two if not mistaken, one to black fathers and the other to both the younger generation of both blacks and whites alike, to share the weight of the baton in their communities.  But the pages turned to fast, and the message was sadly missed on all sides. <br/><br/>There's still seventeen months and the pages needs lifting together, the march needs walking feet and the baton helping hands.﻿

Has Scott Walker been able to make Wisconsin more competitive nationally or globally? An indication would be whether smart money in the form of venture capital is rapidly flowing to Wisconsin in response to the tax cuts, education cuts, reduction in regulations, etc.<br/><br/>I was at a tech event recently in Oakland, California. Proximity to nearby UC Berkeley is one key factor in the local economy as well as 1.5 million people in the county. But we're talking Oakland with high state income tax, high sales taxes, high minimum wage, tight regulatory environment, strong unions and social problems. <br/><br/>One of the venture capitalists noted that companies in the entire state of Wisconsin, with 5.6 million people, raised $84 Million in 2014.<br/><br/>He then noted that companies in and around Oakland attracted $1.185 BILLION in venture funding in 2014.   Which is bigger 1,185 or 84?<br/><br/>The Walker hypothesis is that low taxes, no government, weak education will create a vibrant economy is provably wrong as the Oakland comparison shows.<br/><br/>Imagine if former Oakland Mayer Jean Quan ran for president on the platform, "On my watch the Oakland economic engine was 52 times better per citizen than Scott Walker's Wisconsin!"

Where is the Dept of Labor on this "free labor" issue?  Clearly, it's a scam, especially on students already saddled with college debt.  What happens is that parents (who are able) subsidize corporations, paying rent, transportation and living expenses.  Great deal for Mr. Corporation!  My daughters "free internship" promised to pay for her taxi fare home after working 10-12 hours days (for which they billed clients per hour) at an ad agency in Manhattan.  Oh, but first she had to charge it on her/my credit card, then I got repaid on THEIR billing cycle, not mine. Someone tell me how this is legal and fair.

Idealized, sculpted bodies? Check. Escapist entertainment? Check. The genius in these movies is the characters accessibility. Any of them could be your buddy who is just trying to make a buck the, *ahem*, hard way. Channing Tatum's is charming but I was thrilled to see Joe Manganiello's character gets more well deserved screen time in this sequel! Met him on Mott St. in NYC when he was doing interviews for MM1 and he was an absolute pleasure to talk to. As extraordinarily nice as he is handsome! Helloooo, Joe!!!

Peas in Guacamole? Why not? The Chinese are actually using ketchup in stir fries (mixed with garlic and cayenne pepper).<br/><br/>This reaction is like the one when Columbus brought the tomato from the Americas to Europe and Italians said, "What, put tomato on pasta? Basta! (I read somewhere that it took Italians about 150 years to accept the tomato)  A few weeks ago an Italian actor I was directing saw me eating my homemade noodles with sesame sauce at a rehearsal and was appalled that I would do that to pasta (I use Barilla! instead of Chinese egg noodles - it's good in a pinch).<br/><br/>I was born in the Middle East and think nothing of eating hummus with all the exotic stuff we add to it, while they are appalled by the ruination of the pure chick-pea - tahini - garlic - olive oil purity. Hay, ever had an everything bagel? I bet my ancestors in Eastern Europe would gag at such an abomination. <br/><br/>Globalization is at fault!!

What interested me in the New York times this week? with out a doubt it would be following the recent news of the two convicts, David Sweat and Richard Matt who escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora new york. Sweat and Matt's plans for there escape from a maximum security federal prison were in so in-depth and well thought out it made for a very intriguing story to learn about. Often times my family and I would have compelling arguments over various decisions in this case. Wether it was marveling at how they used the spice, pepper to throw off the scent of dogs or if the shooting of David Sweat was justified, it did not matter. Every detail of this case had me on the edge of my seat, eager to learn more and more about it. I look forward to reading about something just as interesting in the New York Times next week!

They worked on "Black Swan" and still expect to be paid? Awful movie! Maybe they had some part in that scene near the movie's end when Natalie appears to be growling - or something is growling - yeah - like some kind of wild African cat! In that case they should have been immediately terminated, along with the director.

"Does this mean that creating the euro was a mistake?" asks Krugman. "Should I Stay or Should I go" sang the Clash to  a bad relationship. Should the Confederate flag stay or go too. Sorry - being in Charleston the Rebel flag, not normally on my mind, is a question too. Best answer - dump the Euro, tell the Clash to leave, and for God's sake, get rid of that stupid flag!<br/><br/>For the Greeks adopting the euro was like signing a marriage pre-nup with the right hand - but keeping the left hand's fingers crossed. I know the Greeks looked serious - but, they were only kidding - like presenting the Trojan Horse as a gift. Once one accepts the inevitable things aren't always so bad. Krugman tries to paint an awful scenario if the euro is dismantled but fails because even he is unconvinced of a certain disaster.<br/><br/>A devaluating currency isn't such a great idea either. Seriously, how much devaluation would the Finns accept to be able to compete with the Chinese? And once the Finns start will the Danes and everyone else be far behind as their living standards and social benefits inevitably sink to those of, say, Vietnam. The best solution - a sloppy and contentious one to be sure - but practiced by all the successful Asian countries are tariffs and import prohibitions.<br/><br/>It woks for them - so why not Europe and the US too.

In my basement I have a box which contains ripped (how else could they possibly be?) ticket stubs from the '70s from NY Ranger games ($12 for sixth-row seats. Remember when red seats were affordable to simple people like us, NYers?), Met games at Shea, and Jet games at Shea, too. <br/><br/>This new ticketing style has also affected concerts, and I saved my stubs from Central Park shows ($5 for the best seats, $3 for the others) and other local arenas.<br/><br/>It's just weird these days when I go to any event at MSG and they beep me in with their scanner hovering over my letter-sized computer printout. <br/><br/>Bring back real tickets!!!!!

@ Rachida — The game is “NOT soccer”??? That’ll surprise the Brits, who invented both the game and the name in the 19th century, and have continued to use that word (and synonyms) to the present.<br/><br/>You’re free to call the game whatever you like, but don’t fall for the false pretentiousness of the fiction that there’s one, and only one, correct name for it. (Neither “soccer” nor “football” is trademarked, and there’s no Bureau of Usage otherwise awarding ownership of words in English!)<br/><br/>— Brian

What's new here? This is the way Obama rolls. He's the scolder-in-chief, blaming everyone and anything for his total lack of success in achieving anything during his presidency (And no, it's not the fault on the Republican Congress. Give them something they can support, such as TPP, and they will provide Obama with the votes he needs, even more so than his own Democrats!).  Go ahead. Google the phrase "Obama blames."  You will get 15 million hits.

@DR: in what way did Jerry mention anyone's sex life?<br/><br/>Lefty liberals: always looking for some way to demonize their opposition!<br/><br/>Too bad you missed out on calling Jerry a "homophobic racist who intends to impose theocracy!" That would made it a trifecta.

What's been happening since 1980 is that government turned into a kleptocracy--despite all of the anti-tax rhetoric, do you EVER see a poor ex-Congressperson? They're in it for the money. You look at skanky grifters like Michele Bachmann, who go on taxpayer-financed junkets and ask what, if any, accounting did she give for the funds received (from the taxpayer) for her vainglorious quest for the presidency. You look at Jeb! who made a fortune from connections he fostered during his terms as governor of Florida.<br/>Mr. Obama at least tried to do some good, but American racism--and GOP obstructionism--blunted these efforts.<br/>Now Senator Sanders is given hatchet-jobs in this paper and other media as being an ex-radical, and the Repubs label him a "communist"--which he wasn't. I'm waiting to see the other shoe fall from the anti-communist movement of the 1930s and 1950s--its inherent anti-Semitism.

@AACNY<br/>"Poll-driven"???  Lol!<br/>Funny, how selective partisan memory is!<br/>The Dem pols were caught BETWEEN the polling of the Democratic base (against the war) and the polling of the national electorate (for the war).  We do agree, though, Dem politicians in Congress DID vote on 'political expediency', just not the politics you think you remember.  <br/><br/>They allowed themselves to be cowed by the war-mongers in the Executive branch (and who flat-out manufactured 'data' to get those votes, it should be added).

Did Bloomberg think naming this course Trump would lend it credibility and draw celebrity obsessed amateur golfers to this 'faux' links fiasco?  Among amateur golfers who travel to play iconic golf courses, any course with the name Nicklaus associated with the design is a non starter.  The PGA and it's corporate partners at NBC and CBS have long associated with anybody or thing that might enhance revenue for them.  For example, it wasn't that long ago that Limbaugh and his odious cigar were featured prominently at the Pebble Beach Pro Am.  Didn't matter that Rush was spewing some of the most divisive, hate soaked, misogynistic bile on the radio.  Now Trump, a blowhard, narcissistic celebrity billionaire, whose signal accomplishment has been to illustrate just how craven our culture has become, marches on stage with his dime store hate and racism.<br/>It's no wonder that the wonderful game of golf is losing players at a rate that will shut half the courses in the country in just a few more years.  This 'Bronx Tale' is emblematic of the arrogance and ego of men like Bloomberg and Trump and the legendary Nicklaus.  Meanwhile, there remains the annoying  and hopefully embarrassing problem of 25,000 homeless kids in NYC.  What to do, what to do?  Hey wait!  The guy playing by himself in the photo doesn't have a caddy.

I was shocked by the doctor who didn't  know how his petite mother cared for his large father so long--well, why didn't you intervene? Come on! My sister and I cared for our mother for 20 years--at the end, I was in my early seventies, hobbling with arthritis. Once, when Mom was being admitted to the hospital, they came with a wheelchair. She was in a bed. I looked questioningly and the male nurse said, "I have watched the whole 10 hours you have been here and this is for you." I was defensive at first, but really was grateful and thanked him. You can walk blocks and blocks inside a hospital.

Angry and racist (some) of them may be, but has the left ever once asked why there is discontent amongst those on the right?<br/><br/>The typical response to any anti-illegal immigrant musings is to scream "racism!" as loudly as possible, regardless of the context or content of said opinions.  The left has managed to create a climate where the only acceptable answer to illegal immigration is 'amnesty for all.'  Dissenters be damned to the eternal wasteland of formally silenced 'racists'.<br/><br/>When people see their culture and way of life rapidly change, foreign nationals pouring unchecked over our borders, no attempt by many immigrants to integrate into American society (let alone learn the de facto official language), depressed wage rates from an excess of unskilled labor  and billions of dollars spent on benefits and programs for people who came here illegally, you cannot expect them not to be upset.  You also cannot expect people to be happy about amnesty for all, even though no Democrat has presented the country with a good explanation as to why millions of illegal immigrants are beneficial (as opposed to the millions of highly educated foreigners seeking entry into America, which Democrats apparently are not interested in helping out).<br/><br/>Illegal immigrants are good for businesses looking to pad their bottom line and Democrats looking to expand their voting base.  How does it benefit low and middle income Americans?  Who knows.  No one has bothered to explain it.

And then, when I had the J from JEDI and realized that 13A must be BABA GHANOUJ, how many ways do I try to spell BABA GHANOUJ before things work out?  At least I had the J so I knew it wasn't GANNOUSH!<br/><br/>KLONDIKE BAR went in pretty quickly, but then I was tempted into Hamlet by "____ not to be" so I questioned the ice cream bar.  GLOW IN THE DARK was something of a guess once I had DARK, not that I've ever been to a rave.<br/><br/>NEOLITHIC?  No.  PALEOLITHIC?  No.  MESOLITHIC (whatever that is)?  No.  Finally hit on MEGALITHIC and GYM shoes.  I liked the clue for BIBLE, and actually thought of it fairly early on -- but didn't have the guts to put it in for a while.<br/><br/>The far NW was the last to fall, as I had put PEA for 1D and AVID for 2D.  But 13A had to be BABA . . . .  I didn't know either Cadranel or Vanderwaal, but did know Minaj and LOFGREN, so I guess I'm 50/50 on celebrities for this one.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this was a puzzle that I thought I wouldn't be able to finish, at least tonight -- and then suddenly it was done.  Have a great weekend, everyone!

What free speech are  you talking about? The man owns the car and he decided  he'd feel better about it without the flag on it. Is it because the flag makes him think about not just the Charleston terrorist but all the hatred that inspired him?, Well, there's that. That's symbols for you.  No one is making you put away your own flag, if you have one. Violating free speech would be making him keep the paint job as it was.. He obviously still loves this TV show (don't know why!) but doesn't love the image on his car. You can paint your own car. Or you should have bought the Gen. Lee yourself, which is not a national landmark. And BTW I feel more and more like "politically correct" can mean anything at all the person saying it doesn't like. Your backwards logic about "free speech" is an example

What else were you expecting? After all, lobbyists for the health insurance industry pretty much wrote the Affordable (This is a laugh) Care Act. Then again, you can also toss in the fact that, uniquely in the so-called 'developed' world, drug companies just get to decree prices for their wares with NO negotiation allowed. That said, it's truly fascinating and educational to hear these lovely people screaming all over the place because the people who'd been denied health insurance for so long in the vast majority of our states, thanks to 'pre-existing conditions' (Which could be, and often were, something as easily treatable in its relatively early stages as hypertension, diabetes or asthma), are - with their newly obtainable coverage - showing up with all the things you'd expect from years of non-treatment due to, well, non-coverage. In the immortal words of Jim Nabors, as 'Gomer Pyle', "Surprise, surprise!"<br/>The only ridiculous thing I haven't heard yet is that all this could have been somehow prevented by high 'junk'-food taxes and enforced weigh-ins and visits to the gym, monitored strictly by trainers who look like the characters on the cover of your typical men's magazine these days. Never mind the even more ridiculous costs - and, shall we say, negative reactions when people subjected to those heavy workouts end up with everything from fractures to heart attacks.<br/>Malcolm X, really, put it best: "As a farmer, I just love to see the chickens coming home to roost."

Ireland as a "success story" for austerity?<br/><br/>Employment in Ireland is still 8.9% *below* 2007 levels.  GDP is still 4.4% *lower* than in 2007.  Talk about ignoring inconvenient facts!<br/><br/>So, after years of Austerity yielding crushing unemployment and drastic reductions in GDP, Ireland has a small upward bounce.  Do you call similar small bounces for non-Austerity policies massive successes each time they happen?  Or do you dismiss them if they don't give your preferred result?<br/><br/>I would consider re-thinking the objectivity of any so-called economist or journalist that touts Ireland as a shining example of Austerity as good policy for economies which are deeply depressed due to lack of demand - they are invariably at odds with the facts.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/the-track-record-for-austerity-in-the-euro-crisis-countries" title="http://www.cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/the-track-record-for-austerity-in-the-euro-crisis-countries" target="_blank">http://www.cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/the-track-record-for-austerity-...</a>

Is this why Pelosi said "pass the law now and read it later"?<br/><br/>Any mandatory health care law that does not address cost containment and tort reform is flawed as we are finding out now with ACA. It is not affordable anymore!

201158
Why have only 1/3 of those eligible signed up?  Because it is a bad deal.  To say that people are getting health care that has been put off is inconsistent with the articles saying with the deductibles it is too expensive to use.  I pay $434 for a policy with an $8000 dollar deductible.  The subsidy is $486.  The insurance company will not pay one dime for my or my wife's care.  Bad politics, bad law, stupid liberals.  Of course I was dropped from my company retiree insurance which was only $272 with a $2500 deductible. For those thinking it will get better...........Iran has a deal they will make with you!

201181
The enrollees are sicker than expected?<br/><br/>Good!<br/><br/>Not good that they are sick.  We want them to get better.  But what this means is that ACA IS HELPING PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP.  Isn't that the point?

Huh? Can you show me any evidence that the rich want to make others poorer so that they can feel richer? I've known many wealthy people, some greedy and some generous.

Re Mary: What disaster? I am neither a jingoist, nor a conservative, nor a member of Rush Limbaugh's fan club, so I can speak without "parti pris(without taking sides)!"  See my reply to the not well thought out and wordy comment of JUDGEROY BEAN. Try going to  hospitals  in Guinea, Senegal, or Ghana, which often operate by candlelight, use old, outdated equipment, and where patients must provide their own medications and even bedsheets! Capitalism is the most successful economic system in the world because it appeals to our human nature. Socialism has been tried and failed in  many countries in the world because people will work hardest when they r working for themselves. A combination of capitalist incentives with due consideration for the poor and downtrodden in r society is the best. Recall what the late historian, Robert Wisdom said about Stalin's failed exercise in forced collectivization. In order to keep the system in place, in order to perpetuate communism, Stalin had over 20 million independent Kulak farmers killed as part of an intimidating, mass terror program! People re incentivized when they believe they r working for themselves. Eliminate  the profit motive,and you eliminate progress.Wisdom also believed that without mass terror, the soviet sysem never would have lasted as long as it did!

Am I to believe that the actuaries did not foresee the spike in costs from a flood of the long neglected newly insured?  <br/><br/>Has anyone seen an advertisement by any major insurer to sign up for nutrition information/education? <br/><br/>Do any policies cover costs, even partial, or discounts in conjunction with gyms or diet consults? Weight loss?<br/><br/>Are insurers aware that poor diet has a direct result on  long term illness? If so, are they working on ways of having any other effect then just belly-aching?<br/><br/>Perhaps a re-evaluation of a pre-emptive role could improve not only their bottom line but the general health &amp; well-being of the country. Imagine that!<br/><br/>How much is the average salary of these CEOs?<br/><br/>Am I to believe that these questions have no obvious answers?<br/><br/>Final word match challenge:<br/>Ounce:Pound - Prevention:Cure.

You didn't read the article, right? There was pent up demand for healthcare. Why? Because way TOO MANY people didn't have it before. That is a disgrace and a joke.<br/><br/>Remove the insurance companies. The words "for profit" and "health insurance" do not belong in the same sentence. Everyone needs healthy insurance, no matter how healthy they are RIGHT NOW at this instant. It's insurance!

Are you saying the well-paid unionized jobs of the prison employees are  more important than lives wasted? Wow! Then let's create situations and laws so that that there are more prisoners, more prisons and thereby more unionized well-paid jobs and make sure more prisoners languish for years awaiting trial and spend an inordinate amount of our taxes for this craziness. I cannot fathom how you can even make this equivalency!

Where do you get your facts?<br/><br/>And who exactly are the wealthy?  Would that be everyone who has more money in their pockets than you do?  Or is it based on some weird calculation from that unquestioned entity of truth, justice and The American Way - the IRS?   Or calculated through a reckoning of those who have no health insurance - oh, that doesn't exist anymore right, it's Obamacare for all!<br/><br/>Your comment adds nothing but your whining attitude about an issue that everyone knows about because we are hammered daily with stories about health, treatment and cost.  If you aren't paying attention then you get what you get.<br/><br/>Stop complaining about "income inequality", the new Democrat meme.  It doesn't explain stupidity.<br/><br/>Your comment

Where do you get your info, CC?  There is no need for a 90 year old to get a hip replacement;they might not even survive the surgery.  The same is true of the heart surgery.  In this country, even against a doctor's recommendation, folks want the impossible done to save a loved one, when that's probably not the best thing for that person, especially a 90 year old.  That's why we have a DNR option.  What's wrong with setting salaries for doctors, nurses, etc.?  Every other profession has that.  Your reasons are not logical!

202469
What about (d): the insurance system has to include incentives for people to reduce/eliminate unhealthy behavior, which by most accounts generate 40-50% of all healthcare costs (obesity, smoking, heart disease)?  People will continue to engage in unhealthy behavior until we make it prohibitively expensive to do so.  <br/><br/>Why should the guy in my office who eats healthy, exercises regularly, has a normal BMI and doesn't smoke, pay the same premium as the 300lb smoker who eats fast food all the time, smokes, and never exercises?  That's insane!<br/><br/>If we enacted a single payer plans that offered "free healthcare" to everyone who didn't smoke, wasn't fat, ate decent food, and exercised, watch how quickly everyone would change their behavior to get that free plan.  Healthcare costs would decrease, and quality of life would improve as well.<br/><br/>Behavior/lifestyle is the single most important driver of healthcare cost.  Why are we so opposed to enacting a system that rewards good, and punishes bad, behavior?

?! The for profit funding of healthcare...which should be a societal burden, IS the problem....made worse by our aging population.

You guys really believed Obama? Maybe you'd have done better by our country to believe Gruber. And Milton Friedman. But y'all will keep reading Krugman's incessant "It's working!" nonsense and trust the bureaucracy to redistribute other peoples' money until, uh-oh, we're Greece.

54% in Minnesota?  Good grief!  Wasn't Obama in Wisconsin bragging about how well functioning Minnesota is?  Well...function with that, Minnesotans.

"How is putting more people on Medicaid a triumph?" -S. Moore<br/><br/>Oooohhhhhhh!  Oooohhhhhhh!  I know this one!<br/><br/>We're talking about human being's lives here.  Because these same people on Medicaid have health insurance whereas without it, they wouldn't.  And with Medicaid, they can be treated for conditions that they might die from if they didn't have health care.  Geez!  <br/><br/>Dr. Krugman is going to cream this guy.

202864
Where's my $2500 savings? Who did this? Why didn't anybody say something? Oh, that's right - all those nasty Republicans &amp; Tea Party types screamed until they were blue in the face; yet those benevolent wonderful Democrats parsed this together behind closed doors, with no bi-partisan support and using parliamentary tricks to pass it. NYT was a leading cheerleader. Wear the albatross - you own it!

Can anyone please explain how "single payer system" would work?<br/>In the first place, that would look like insurance companies wouldn't be doing any business at all, ZERO!!!  Isn't that socialism for all healthcare?<br/>Did they have that in the old Soviet Union? In Yugoslavia under Tito?<br/><br/>Please tell what countries have that today.  Do any of those companies have ANY insurance companies?  Possibly accident, fire, theft, life, etc?<br/>If we get "single payer", will the progressives go after the other insurance companies next, because they are 'greedy'?

Possibly they have accident, fire, theft, life ... insurance cos.<br/>If we get "single payer", will they go after the other insurance companies next, ... because they are 'greedy'?<br/>Yes, under communism no one creates a business, it's always the government, and only the government that does anything good, could do anything good, right, or proper for the country, as Pres. Obama said a few years ago.

Sick people for years with no health care all of sudden put into the system what did we expect? When the only health care they had was an emergency room visit it is only logical for the pent up demand. It’s time we bite the bullet for our years of neglect to these folks. Let’s get them in the system and get them healthier and everybody will benefit. They have had to suffer for years so only a massive transfusion of services will bring them into the fold. Brings to mind the commercial where the guy says pay me now or pay me later! I guess the later has come. It is time we tweaked Obamacare and stopped letting people suffer for lack of healthcare. Let’s turn the Repeal rhetoric into Lets Heal.

Dragging out the lie about low-overhead Medicare??  Medicare cooks the books by having the IRS handle collections and farming out other functions to other government agencies, so Medicare's overhead appears lower than it really is.  Your notion that the government is more efficient that the private sector is laughable!

203052
Can someone tell me why healthcare in America is so darn expensive relative to other countries? Why we pay thousands maybe even tens of thousands of dollars MORE than the same procedure say in Spain? Let me tell you why I think it's so high. I think our government has colluded ( in the form of lobbyists getting chummy with our pols, making decisions behind closed doors),with The Medical Industrial Complex to the degree that there is only room for one pig at the trough. That pig will eat and eat until there is nothing left for the rest of us. Long past time for a Barbecue!

Surely any self respecting minister would insist on a degree of debt relief  restructuring or whatever diplomatic name you want to place on if ?<br/>Without this the Greeks are simply diggings bigger hole for themselves and future generations. A 10 year old can do the math as that amount of debt simply cannot be borne in any meaningful sense by a mere 13 M peoe a large party of whom are retired !!<br/>So get real in a fiscal sense and get off the save the euro  at any and all costs as this crypto currency has had enough time to work as has the socio-politico experiment

Why do I have trouble with a native Brooklynite telling me how to fry chicken?  Hmmmm....<br/><br/>My father's brother, fried the best chicken on earth with my mother's mother a close 2nd.  They were both Southerners.  My uncle' secret was to fry the chicken in leaf lard, and even though he has been dead for about 55 years, he fervently believed that no chicken was worth eating if it hadn't scratched in the dirt and didn't have a bit of grit in its craw.  Who knew that Uncle Bill was talking about what we now call "free range chicken"!  NO chicken was every better at a picnic!

Why is everybody making such a big fuss over the NYT Guacamole-made- with-peas recipe? The recipe received 4 stars on the basis of 205 ratings, which classifies the recipe as "really good," albeit not as fantastic as "delicious!" (with an exclamation point--like "Jeb!" perhaps).  If you don't like peas in guacamole, then don't eat guacamole this way.  <br/><br/>But don't be like the climate-change deniers, who want to forbid/shun/shut down those who believe climate change is real and very important. <br/><br/>Maybe try putting some Velveeta cheese and lots of bacon in the guacamole- mit-peas recipe.<br/><br/>No wonder Ms. Sullivan wants to take a break.  Perhaps we should be less opinionated and more tolerant of alternative views when she gets back. Naah, what fun would that be?

203253
"Is there that much difference between this and getting an autograph?"<br/><br/>Significant difference, if I may.  In the case of the autograph you are getting a personal momento from an individual, penned by their own hand - it is about them offering something, not you engaging in some sort of self-gratification.  Selfies, on the other hand, as the name implies are more about the self, not any other.  Yes, the politician, like a monument, building or bit of scenery, is a decorative add on, but the primary motivation is "look at ME!!".

Why does this fake intellectual get any air time at all? The lack of logic and misrepresentations in his arguments are mind blowing. The only circumstance under which news papers should write about him is if the purpose is to show people what not to be!

So how do you explain President Obama identifying as Black?  He was raised by his WHITE mother and WHITE grandparents in Hawaii or Kansas!  He made a political decision to abandon his White heritage.

Isn't Obamacare wonderful?  Now that we're forced by our government to buy health insurance, the premiums are going to skyrocket!   At least before we had the choice of not paying outrageous premiums.  Now we are mandated to do so!

You ever waited in the emergency with a sick child? You must be kidding! So people getting basic care in the emergency room get top notch care? Next time you get a cold practice what you preach. Go to the emergency room. I hope its on a Saturday night.

Does anyone talk about getting the shipping tycoons to pay a progressive tax?  Now the populace is burdened with 23% VAT!  Horrendous!  Yes, there is need for comprehensive reform, but the VAT will cause the poor and what is left of the middle class to suffer while trying to buy basic necessities.  Nobody really has the answers for this grave situation.

Renovating?  It's time to move to one's house in the Hamptons, of course!<br/><br/>When it comes to the noise, dust, disruption, and debris of renovation, a lot of people don't realize (or simply don't care!) that their renovation is affecting others within the building who live in adjacent apartments (and who don't necessarily have the means to "escape").  That could be a whole other article for the Times to write!

204101
And just which costs are you going to reduce or eliminate?  Your doctor getting paid less?  Your nurse? The person who cleans the hospital?  Nobody is accepting a cut in pay or benefits!!  NOBODY!!!  In fact Obama wants folks to get paid more not less.

204149
And what about the arbitrary ways property taxes are calculated? What about how they double-tax income and investments? What of how rising property taxes -- over 150% on some residences! -- have fueled increasing rents in places like New York City? To say there are no bad incentives and few downsides in property taxes is simply wrong.

204211
Has there been no debate on TV explaining the pros and cons of each side? It seems people are confused about the implications of each vote. There are scare rumors and tactics. Why can't the value of devaluation be explained and the unending loop in which the economy is found not be explained--that they are procrastinating on decisions that will have to be made. They may as well sell off their antiquities and a couple of islands, and little by little the whole country. It is shameful the power of economic forces and (foreign) capital. For all the democratic flow of information, it seems people in Greece and outside, are very confused about what is has happened, is happening and will happen. In unfree closed societies the problem is lack of information. In so-called open democratic ones the problem is becoming more and more that of obfuscation with excess information and false rumors.<br/>  In any case, it is amazing that they could put a referendum together in a week. The logistics of mounting such a civic event can be complicated.<br/>Good luck to the Greeks tomorrow!

Will Obamacare be repealed or won't it? Will Congress fund it or won't it? Will the web site be fixed or not? Blah, blah, blah. We the people just need to do what we need to do and Democrats be damned. Resist. Refuse. Revolt.  EXEMPT OURSELVES!  We did not comply with Prohibition and we simply should not comply with Obamacare.  For religious reasons. For privacy reasons. For the cause of liberty and freedom and in protest of the idea that the federal government (under  one party rule, no less), can force private citizens to purchase anything with our own money. Are we citizens or subjects? Mice or (wo)men? Just say NO to socialism and to the corrupt, unionized, far left IRS: the gestapo of America's political class. Afraid of arrest? not to worry! After all, the federal government ignores millions of illegals who are breaking U.S. immigration law every day. Our Founders pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. All we have to do is just say no to a scheme we all know is un-American and a violation of our most basic founding fundamentals of privacy, self reliance, limited government and individual freedom.

Why are over-paid and greedy CEO's getting lashed so much? If they didn't take all that money does anyone really believe the company would be a better company? I don't see that extra profit ever trickling down into lower costs. All the extra money will do is grow the company--as it should. Sheesh!

No mint on pasta? Seriously? Every summer I make a lovely pesto with mint instead of basil. People love it. I was just in Turkey in June, and at one place I was served a pasta dish with a sauce comprised predominantly of mint and and chiles. It was quite tasty, and I intend to emulate it. Perhaps the trick is to make mint the primary or only herb so as to keep its flavor from clashing with the others.<br/><br/>I'll tell you one thing: I'll take mint with pasta over peas in guacamole any day!

How does a population get addicted?  Most people just live ordinary (stressful) lives.  Their govts and big businesses gamble (while living quite well) and then come back when they've lost the gamble to tell ordinary people they've been wasteful souls.<br/>--And here's the bill, my dear.  Puh-lease!

Yes, the French love to hate us – after all, they were on our side during the revolutionary war and we reciprocated by liberating them in WWII – how embarrassing?   <br/><br/>But it would have been nice for Ms. Dowd to remember that it is still July 4th back home as we read her column (even though it technically appears on July 5th). <br/><br/>Instead Ms. Dowd, in the style of “when in Rome, do as doing the Romans do,” was being French and dismissive of America, even on its birthday!  Happy Independence Day, Ms. Dowd!

How about this situation?<br/><br/>One of the two men I know on the SOR got there because he hired an "escort" from Craigslist. He'd done it numerous times, hiring women who claimed to be between 19 and 26 (he was in his 50s).<br/>But one young lady he hired, he discovered later, was only 15. She'd stolen a car and purchased illegal drugs a few months earlier, been caught, and sentenced to three years probation, with the first year on house arrest with a GPS monitor.<br/>She got bored, slipped the GPS device off, and stole another car. She then somehow hooked up with a pimp, who told her up front (per her later testimony) that she'd have to turn tricks for him to put her up more than a couple days. She'd told him no problem, as she'd already slept with most of the guys in her High School.<br/>So...she turned 3-4 tricks, over two days, before deciding she didn't like doing it and she again ran off. Again, she stole a car, and again, she got caught. She then told the police what she'd been doing, so they basically gave her a deal on the theft, if she testified against the pimp and the customers (none of whom had a clue how old she really was).<br/>The guy I know initially denied having had sex with a child, but once he was shown the evidence, he cooperated fully. The initial charge would have sent him to prison for 20 years; instead, he got 2-5 years (1 year prison, 1 year parole). But he's also now on the SOR for 25 years. For a crime he didn't know was happening, that he would never have done!

205032
Are you serious? So even though she had ID showing she was 21 he was still found guilty? What on earth does the law expect of someone in that situation? How can they seriously be held accountable for something like that? Are we expected to do thorough background checks or something? That's really unbelievable. This makes me furious!

GUN LAWS?  It's OK for people to have easy access to guns that kill many times more people in the US than terrorists ever year.  But kids who engage in sexual experimentation without strict observance of age limits are automatically labeled as pedophiles?  Our priorities are all messed up in this society!  The girl's mother was OK with the sexual encounter and pleaded for mercy for the guy, whose parents are defending him against cruel and unusual punishment.  Their sexual encounter was by mutual consent. There was no harm done to either party.  In fact, maybe they even enjoyed themselves.  If they got married, would the guy still be labled a pedophile.  The girl deceived him so she could have sex; not vice versa.  If she were 19 and he were 14, then she'd be a perpetrator?  We're fine being overly punitive about sexuality when there is mutual consent, but laissez-faire about gun violence!  If you really want to protect kids, fight for gun safety.  I'd say that sex partners sould card each other, or ask for a copy of a birth certificate.  Maybe a note from a parent.  But that might spoil the mood.  I've worked with abused kids, some sexually abused.  The key factor is coercion.  An adult forcing a child to have sex.  The person being lied to and coerced was not the child, but the adult here.  In colonial times in some states kids could be married with parental permission by the age of 11 or 12.  So if the groom was 40 and bride 11, what sort of sex was that?  Wife rape?

How would all of the Dominicans in the United States who are in the country illegally feel if they were put in this situation? I'm sure they wouldn't be feeling too happy. Most countries today are made up of immigrants, like it or not. At one point weren't all of our ancestors immigrants?? My parents families can't here from another country. With all of the misery going on in all corners of the world, show a little compassion! for those that have less than nothing!!

205853
Dinesh D'Souza?  I have been wondering where he was, since he made his millions on his tome "The end of racism."  I have always been baffled and intrigued by those "intellectuals" from other countries who come to the US and take the easy rode to financial success by joining the extreme American racists. <br/><br/>I made a mistake then of purchasing his one-sided tome, and wondered why he did not first write a book deconstructing the kind of destructive racism in his native country, why has been camouflaged as a "caste" system.<br/><br/>I know how to argue against diehard white American racists.  But what am I to do with a brown-skinned writer from the upper caste in his native country, who comes here and justify white-black racism by intellectual attacks.  Is he aware that one is more likely to see a white-black friendship or even marital Union than one between an Indian (even of lower caste) and a black person?<br/><br/>I have no intellectual tolerance for such immigrants who make easy money by attaching themselves to fabricated "post-racial" ideologues.<br/><br/>Did he go to a prison where some black men were?  Perhaps that should give him ideas for another "end-of-racism"tome!

Where did Kristoff say the US should launch a war? He spoke of targeted sanctions and "hands=on-diplomacy to pressure all sides." Furthermore, he says teh US should "work closely with Kenya, Uganada, and Ethiopia" to accomplish these things.<br/><br/>The fact that this is the most recommended comment makes me wonder how many people even bothered to read Kristoff's column!

205923
And where are these businesses supposed to be taken away from? My country? Germany? I think not!<br/><br/>And no, there aren't suddenly going to be more consumers to buy more Mercedeses. What you propose can only happen at the expense of my country, and we won't vote for that.<br/><br/>You see, in US states, local and state governments take a percentage of your income, but there is still room on top for the (8-10-12-15%) fiscal transfers between states.<br/><br/>In European countries, that room for fiscal transfers doesn't exist. Any fiscal transfer from my country would have to go at the expense of cuts to education and healthcare spending here, think we'll vote for that? Better think again because hell will freeze over before that happens.<br/><br/>We're better off without the Euro. The Euro shouldn't be saved.

205942
And to implement all this with a governement lead by PASOK, ND, or Syriza? Next test will be done by a Golden Dawen lead governement?<br/><br/>Syriza was elected while promising: No new contract with Troika!<br/><br/>This means either "more money without condition", or national bankruptcy. Since rest of Europe does not agree to give more money without condtion it turns out that the voters have chosen ---&gt; national bankruptcy.<br/><br/>All what you are claiming should be done by Greece, the Greek voters, Greek governements, in essence by the Greek people (something done from outside ... see Merkel compared to Hitler).<br/><br/>So, we'll see soon how the bankrupt, now Syriza lead governement, elected by majority, will incentivise Daimler to construct a Mercedes factory in Thesaloniki. <br/><br/>And good luck to the Greek people for its future!

What do people expect when you have the Government guarantee, through fines and force, to require everyone to buy insurance from these companies?  Then you have these companies be required to insure things like abortions and gender changes for everyone and they are going to require a huge increase. <br/><br/>What isn't mentioned is the elephant in the room being the deductible that has increased for most families, doubled or quadrupled.  Now they want to charge more for the polices.  BLAME DEMOCRATS!  It's totally their fault.

Google search? I've got a documentary to back me up! <br/><br/>Everyone has an opinion that's the whole point. What matters is the science. Anthropogenic climate change is real, thiomserol causing autism is not. Compared to the benefit of vaccines to humanity, the whole enterprise of modern medicine has been little more than a rounding error.  I'll watch your documentary, but the facts are the facts.  Bruni has the substantive facts correct.<br/><br/>People need to think about ALL medical interventions as a cost/benefit. There has been no single greater benefit that medicine has bestowed upon mankind than vaccines. That is the truth. Paralytic polio would kill or paralyze 1 million children per year in 1950.  2014 marked the third year in a row that not a single child worldwide was paralyzed by this virus. Even if there is some minuscule risk to vaccines (and there is only modest evidence for older formulations that there is), that risk is plainly worth the cost. <br/><br/>Viz: even though a given chemotherapy might make you nauseas, it also might cure your cancer. People are generally willing to make that exchange of cost and benefit. Why are vaccines any different? Sure, the potential harm from not vaccinating is far less immediate but it is no less real.<br/><br/>Documentaries and fear mongering aside, facts are facts.

What to do with that big package of porcini mushrooms from Costco? I chopped and sauteed the whole batch with onions and froze it. The mushrooms pieces are removable and didn't stick together much. Take out a handful for any dish. Great idea! Wonderful on roasted potatoes or any other vegetable, in eggs, on steak.

 "Marcel: What reforms?"<br/><br/>You claimed that the Netherlands and Germany, two export oriented/strong countries, did benefit from Euro while others not. ...<br/>Euro was introduced in 1999, or in bank note in 2002. In this time Germany was called the ill man of Europe. Euro caused a boom in Spain and Greece until 2008, but things worsened further in Germany until about 2005/06.<br/><br/>A joking description of the current German political situation is:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Schroeder (or red-green) implemented reforms in-between 2000-2005 (Agenda 2010, or Hartz reforms). Merkel is doing no reforms at all and is therefore the "queen of Europe", or at least the undisputed Chancellor of Germany.<br/><br/>And you know where Schroeder currently is?<br/>Seeing the sort of Schroeder will tell to all other European leaders: Do NOT implement reforms!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>My point is: Did German benefit from the reforms, or from the Euro? My experience with it: Germany ***really suffered initially*** from the Euro. The result of the reforms (+ the lack of a German housing bubble, a strong social security net which Greece does not has etc.) you could see in 2009/10 ... <br/><br/>In 2015 it may be easy to say that Euro was made for Germany ... actually it was made by France...<br/>"Marcel: What reforms?"<br/>Agenda 2010 --- for example.

Why all the selfie hate here? Is there really a fundamental difference between taking a selfie and asking someone else to take your picture? Because I am not seeing it. Even the oldest, crankiest fart on this forum has asked someone to take his picture at an iconic place like the Eiffel Tower—because anyone can buy a postcard of the tower, but having yourself in the scene documents that you were there. It also makes for a much more interesting photo to share with friends and family. The celebrity selfie, like the more traditional vacation picture, is not an apocalyptic tool of narcissists, people, get a grip!

What do you mean by "up to date"?  Where is an adult supposed to go for vaccines, or even know what vaccines they are supposed to be getting (other than the flu)?  Adults don't have regular general doctors, that is just a fact of life in the US.  <br/><br/>I read an article about young people getting shingles because the immunity from the chicken pox vaccine wears off with time, and so I went to the local CVS clinic with my husband to get shingles vaccines.  The clinic said they wouldn't give it to us without a separate perscription from a doctor!  If they did give it to us, I hear it would be $200/each out of pocket, since my husband and I are each only about 40 years old, so too young for insurance coverage.<br/><br/>In the US, it is a lot of work and expense for adults to get vaccines.  Even when people, on their own, try to get a vaccine, they find multiple obstacles in their way.  That is why people don't do it.  If you want people to get vaccines, you have to make it cheap and convenient.

REPUBLICANS AFRAID?  It is really the case that the gaggle of Republican presidential candidates are trying to stir up fear among voters?  How can they do that when they're so busy pillorying each other.  The more they take cheap shots at each other, the less ammo they'll have left to look beyond the dim horizons of their political landscape to contemplate any possible strategies toward the Democrats.  I say, a pox on the houses of all the Republican candidates. Let them continue to maul and savage each other in the press and anywhere that anyone will listen to them.  For their party has plenty of naysayers about just about anything you could imagine.  That's excruciatingly clear in the way they've confounded and shut down the Legislative branch of the government, proving that the country manages to work around and strengthen itself despite their worst efforts.  Let them increasingly show their disconnect from any rational efforts to govern.  What with gerrymandering on the chopping block, they will not be guaranteed districts unfairly formed to ensure their seats in Congress anymore.  I say, The more mayhem the merrier!  Let the tomfoolery commence!  Gee, with all this argument when do they have time to practice the religious beliefs they claim to be so threatened?  Mostly threatened by none other than they themselves!

Should we start asking people for ID? "Hold on, before you unzip your pants, may I see some ID?" What is this, buying a drink? No, it's having normal teenage sex! <br/><br/>Now, I'm 26 and I won't date or sleep with anyone less than 21 because it just feels too young. When I was 18, I slept with a 15 year old who was turning 16 in two weeks.<br/><br/>I committed a sex crime in my state, in theory, although trust me - both of us were entirely consensual, had a great time, and ended up dating each other for four years. Had the 15 year olds parents found out and not liked me, in theory my life too could of been ruined by a fire and brimstone judge who panders to the extremist religious right. <br/><br/>Our laws are so absurd I don't even know where to begin.

'The most important economic activity, tourism, 20% of the GDP, more than doubled under austerity,'<br/><br/>This just proves that being so fixated on 'austerity' -(or not?) - might be the wrong fixation? Give Greece the economical organization or 'management' of Switzerland and the country will be sustainable self sufficent. And I hate to say that as I can't stand 'managers' who see in everything a management problem - but economists who see in everything a 'austerity problem' - or some monetary problem which led them to the insanity to suggest a change to some Mickey Mouse Currency are not much better.<br/><br/>Economists - and especially in the higher echelons of academia finally should come down to reality and work with irreversible conditions!

And why is it that you don't question the parents of the man involved?  He should have been taught to stay away from high school girls and protect himself against this very type of situation.  I am so very tired of the dialogue blaming girls.  She was 14!  Not exactly at an ideal decision making juncture in life.

209258
Which two and for what issue?<br/><br/>But then, why should they? The conservative justices have made crystal clear that recusal is entirely optional, and absolutely to be avoided on important issues (or have you forgotten that both Scalia and Thomas had serious personal conflicts in the horrendous Bush v. Gore decision in 2000, where both had family members either working for Bush or in line to directly benefit, politically and financially, from a Bush victory, yet refused to even consider recusing themselves).<br/><br/>Then we have Scalia, who has repeatedly proven himself unbothered by holding literally opposite core positions (strict interpretation in some cases, versus expansive interpretation on other cases) from one case to the next. He used to at least be consistent in claiming that he held strictly to the view that the way to understand what a law intended if the words were confusing was to determine what the authors intended. Well, King v. Burwell has made clear that argument has left the building, as regards Scalia!<br/><br/>The reason so many Constitutional lawyers and scholars are now openly referring to the four core conservatives on the USSC as "activist" judges is because they've made it clear they WILL decide based on achieving a political or ideological result, NOT the actual constitutionality or clear meaning and intent of laws.

Why is it I always remember the French joke about lucky Pierre when I read about France? As for Monica, her claim to fame is that she had a tryst with a sitting President. She saved the evidence to prove it and so she has. Now we are supposed to pay attention to her views on what? I'm not a prude, but heaven help us when young women make headlines because they are women - think Bristol Palin and just say NO! It's like the NRA claiming guns don't kill. They serve as flower pots cause they're so pretty. There is much that is beautiful about France and America, even some of the people.  Our National Kill'em club ought not to get headlines about their stand on this and that. Maybe, if we ignore them, they'll go away. We already know what they'll say when the next massacre happens, so why bother to ask them? As for snooping, maybe the French ought to grant amnesty to Snowden as a gesture of the love they have for us.

Wine- what part of taking responsibility for one's actions don't you get?  HE was the sole person responsible for his actions, stop making excuses for this ADULT...  being 19 is being an adult, not a child.. his job was to make sure that she was of legal age by whatever means necessary... All states place the burden on the adult,  not the child.   Show your papers please!!!

What was to be gained by a referendum ordered by Tsypras? Is Europe impressed? I do not think so. The first thing the Greeks should do is tax heavily all of the people who for years defrauded their country. Is fraud a national pastime in Greece? And now they want Europe to pay for their blatant mistakes. Time to pay up!

Yes, Anne, and the entire responsibility is on the "young man's" shoulders? No consideration of the fact that this young woman who could have been 13 or retarded or anything else… wasn't!<br/>She lied about her age in her eagerness to seduce this naive boy, and now he has to pay this draconian price, while she goes free?<br/>This is the most extreme and unfair sexism.

And what of the political prisoners in Castro's jails? What of the monopoly Castro has on all goods and services entering and leaving Cuba. What of the misery this man has caused over the last 60 odd years. What of the land and wealth he took without compensation? What about the executions of his political enemies?<br/>All this is wiped clean because YOU want relations with a maniac?? WHAT can they do for us? Nothing.<br/>The Castros and their henchmen should be tried and convicted and hung for the murderers that they are!

Why didn't the team from Japan just deflate the soccer balls?  That would have slowed down the flight of the ball, and evened things out.  Seeing as deflating balls is OK in real football and all (that's sarcasm in case you don't recognize it). If any of the light issue is true, which is totally doubtful. Strange how some carp when its women who lead the world. Well, just get used to it! 

211022
Are you kidding? It has been the Castro oligarchy who have neglected and have stolen money from the Cuban people. They have had the patronage of the Soviet Union, Venezuela and have been able to trade with the rest of the world! DUH!

Again with the canard of 'the bailout money didn't go to the Greek people, it went to the banks' ?!?<br/><br/>So the Greeks (fraudulently, to a good extent) borrow $300B, give or take. Spend it.<br/>(Not on useful stuff, but that's another story) <br/><br/>Then the house of cards comes crashing down, the banks want their money back, the Greeks don't have it anymore.<br/><br/>So the EU and the IMF say, fine, we don't want you to go bankrupt, so we'll pay back the banks, after some cutting of the debt, and then you, Greeks, pay us back, but at much lower interest rates and over much longer time than what the banks would have accepted.<br/>(And you'll get additional EU money as a bonus, but that's yet another story)<br/><br/>And that somehow means those $300B didn't actually go to the Greeks ?!? In which universe of upside-down logic I wonder?!?<br/><br/>(And, by the way, one should not put a lot of stock in opinions of people who are close to Yanis Varoufakis)

211267
Restructuring the existing debt ?  Give me a break already.  The debt right now and for the foreseeable future is a "write off".  There is not a single economist, Finance minister - whomever - would do anything other than kiss whatever money that has been lent to Greece already, good bye !  I suppose the reason this has not been done already, is the slim hope that reforms would be introduced, spending would be cut - austerity measures would be taken - to have even a shot at getting back any of these funds. Who in their right mind would lend them any more ?

NY Times Op-ed, you're threatening DR with the $30m in aid when Haitians account for almost USD$120m in HEALTH cost alone? (Obamacare don't cover them!). Every time NY Times publishes an Anti-Dominican article, you only betray your ignorance on the reality people on the island face everyday. 5 million Dominicans live on one meal per day and you're asking us to take in how many Haitians per year, 100000, 200000? Your threats of using foreign aid and boycotts  to intimidate us reeks of typical gringo imperialism; it's the 21st century answer to the old gunboat diplomacy.<br/><br/>What do you hysterical activists think of the Bahamas, keeping Haitians in cages and deporting them with impunity?

In "Lovers and Other Strangers (a movie from the 1970's?) Bea Arthur, playing an Italian mother from Brooklyn, utters the line "Don't Worry About Happiness It Will make Ypu Miserable." For some reason I never forgot it!!!

From the banks' perspective, isn't it more profitable to turn Greece into a guaranteed loser? In finance, graduate students are taught that betting on a potential winner carries a 30% likelihood of earning a profit, whereas that outcome increases to 70% with a dead horse. And the Greek centaur is slaughtered and full of worms. It will be interesting to see how many put options the banks bet on Greece to recover the money they'll eventually find a way of getting anyway. It would not surprise me that they have put options on their forecasted spillout. Call it double dipping with forensic accounting pending. Meanwhile, let the plebian Greeks eat moussaka (or is it moose caca - see My Big Fat Greek Wedding)!

Who woulda thunk it? At the ripe old age of 68, I seem to have become a soccer (excuse me, FOOTBALL) fan!<br/>I thoroughly enjoyed England v Germany, and then, last night, I watched the final. I thought I'd have these games on while I took care of some chores, but I found myself glued to my seat. These young women put on some of the best sports action I can remember seeing anywhere. The NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and all the other stuff you see on TV has got nothin' on these athletes!

If Larry King can continue doing his thing well into his 80's, why not?  His CNN show worked, because, quirks and all, it was an institution.  So what if it was not done in some mega trendy way?  The longevity of his show made it an institution, and that carried it's own trendiness.  For years, an issue wasn't the hottest thing if it did not get coverage within 48 hours on "Larry King Live."<br/><br/>Larry should keep doing his thing until he can't, or people stop listening.  It seems people still are.  Why not!

The Greeks blame the Germans for all their financial sorrow while waving the Greek flag not knowing (?) that the colours, blue and white, are the colours of the kingdom of Bavaria - the first king of modern Greece, Ludwig I, was a prince of Bavaria.<br/>Later kings were also 'northern' i.e. Danish (princes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg). Prince Philip, the husband of queen Elisabeth II, e.g, is a prince of Denmark AND of Greece.<br/>Somehow when times get tough, and they are in Greece, sic!, people forget their history, blaming countries for their current (financial) situation and ignoring that these countries were the same ones who created the 'modern' Greek state.

213518
How on earth did you conclude that they said no to the oligarchs? The Greek oligarchs are their shipping magnates, who per constitution, do not have to pay a single cent in taxes! And their money as well as that of the other rich members of Greek society, has long been safely bunkered in safe tax havens abroad.<br/>I wish the Greek people the very best, but I doubt that the present government is seriously thinking of their well-being.  Corruption and ending feeding an overblown public sector with new posts has not stopped under them. In some ways it is sadly the same procedure as always.

Hans Werner Sinn?!! The guy has the reputation as Germany's most adamant neo-liberal - and that's saying a lot in Germany. He's also known for interpreting numbers - such as the ones "mis"-quoted above - to fit his Hayekian malarkey.

Where's that dude Paul Ryan, who was blowing so much fluff about austerity and how its the way for the US, all that stuff about deficit and overspending and what not? We were saved by Paul Krugman, who stood up and warned us against folks like Paul Ryan, just imagine if he had become VeePee! shudder.

213670
Are these efforts in making people healthier or reducing healthcare costs?<br/><br/>I don't know the numbers, but it's certainly the case (and maybe even commons sense) that a disproportionate amount of healthcare dollars are spent in the last few months of someone's life.  How can we figure out when it makes sense to "pull the plug?"<br/><br/>There's also plenty of care being doled out that is more discretionary than not.  For instance, psoriasis is currently best treated using a variety of biologics like Enbrel and Humira that cost in excess of $30,000 per year.  They are so profitable that manufacturers can afford to advertise them heavily, as we are all familiar with them through commercials on the age-skewed evening news.  The manufacturers are so keen on us using them that they will cover unusually high co-payments in the form of a free secondary insurance policy, leaving the patient with a trivial monthly payment.<br/><br/>Psoriasis can be physically and emotionally debilitating, I understand.  But for most sufferers it is basically itching, some unsightly patches and dandruff.  Remember the commercials for treating the "heartbreak of psoriasis?"  That's what it is, heartbreak, not life threatening.  How can we create incentives for folks NOT to use it?  An insurer could provide a year's worth of coverage for free and save money!

213708
You aren't seriously claiming this, are you??<br/><br/>Yes, the grandmother did commit a crime, making a knowing purchase of a firearm for her felon grandson (though given her health and dementia, its doubtful she was ever prosecuted).<br/><br/>But the gun store owners, possessing a Federal Firearms License which VERY clearly says they are barred by law from knowingly making a strawman gun sale, or a sale knowing the gun was intended to go to a barred individual such as a convicted felon, also clearly broke Federal law! <br/><br/>You'd have a case if grandma had walked in on her own and never mentioned the grandson. But even the gun store owner admits both were in the store and that the grandson made clear it was him, and that he couldn't legally make the purchase himself. That made the gun store owner a knowing participant in a felony crime.

213790
BRING THEM BACK?   Nobody and nothing can ever bring back the father who slaughtered his son, then committed suicide.  No financial awards can heal the emotional injury to the survivors.  But for once the court decided in favor of family survivors, presenting textbook proof of the grandmother's inability to understand clearly what she was doing.  Since she reportedly said that she had not filled out the required form for purchase since the gun was not intended for her, the gun shop owners should have immediately cancelled the purchase and called the police to inform them of the illegal attempt by a felon to purchase a gun.  By failing to do that, the gun shop owners have blood on their hands.  And empty pockets.  Rightly so!  It seems that they were, in effect, co-conspirators in the murder-suicide resulting from the gun sale, since they knew, or should have known, that the intended user of the gun was a felon.  Does the court award of damages to the survivors signal an erosion of Second Amendment rights?  Only to the 25% of NRA members who hold the rest of us hostage to reasonable gun control measures.  And the 90% of voters who seek gun safety laws.  We are entitled to pursue life, liberty and happiness; but we can only do that if we're alive.  Not if we're shot dead by gunfire.  In fact, more than twice the Americans die from guns than in all the wars we've ever fought.  I think that gun safety should be top priority to increase National Security.

"Greece was scammed from day one"?  Pardon, but you have this turned around.

If all you say is true, which I am willing to accept is the case, why does Europe want to keep Greece in its currency system?  Throw the miscreants out!<br/>Greece's departure from the Eurozone seems to be a win - win, if anything can be called winning in this disaster.

That is another Big Lie.

Do you really need "scientific support" for something that is a no brainer? Just as we don't need to spend tens of millions of dollars on studies showing that over-eating makes us fat, so we do not need research to show the obvious consequences of over-using technological gadgets. Sending texts takes time, time stolen away from real-life situations, including sleep, talk, learning, play, etc. Allowing children to sit around while wondering virtual territories cannot possibly prepare them to deal with reality. What kind of citizens will these children become? Virtual citizens, of course! Citizens that have no tools to participate in constructing a functional society. Woe to them, what vapid lives they will lead!

As a newbie to "Football", and in the interest of fair play only, what's the deal with that Japanese goaltender having the sun in her eyes for the first 45+ minutes?  By the time Hope Solo got the "sun-field", the shadows and blinding sun were almost gone.  To me, that didn't seem to be very fair.  I understand that sun (and the wind, for that matter) is a factor in all outdoor sports but in baseball for instance, you change sides every half inning.  In American football, more analogous to the situation here, you change sides every 15 minutes.  For this World Cup game, that poor Japanese girl had horrific shadows and blazing sun (I had to tone down the brightness on my TV to see the ball when it was in that end!) the entire first half...especially at the start of the game...where she gave up 4 goals in 20 minute!  Hope Solo might have performed similarly had she started the game with that setting sun in her eyes.  They couldn't have played earlier?...when the sun was high and shadows weren't a factor?...or started the game an hour later?...when, as we saw when Hope Solo had that side, the shadows had almost no effect on a goaltenders line of sight.<br/>I certainly celebrate our team winning the World Cup...I just don't think it was done on a truly level "pitch"!

He paid the previous owner for the land and for the house, but who will pay for the services that make that land valuable? <br/><br/>Do you think we should tax work?  Tax sales?  Or should we be taking a portion of the annual value of each piece of land in order to provide those services?<br/><br/>If some individuals choose to remain in such communities despite not being able to do their share to pay for those services, perhaps we offer them the option of deferring a portion of their property tax, as a lien against the property, to be satisfied when they move out, sell or transfer the property.<br/><br/>We don't seem to have much sympathy for tenants when their landlord increases the rent; interesting that we have so much sympathy for those who may be asking to be subsidized in a home close to the jobs others want, the schools others need, the services that could be useful to young families -- and sometimes in homes much too large for the retiree to heat/cool/clean/maintain!

May I be so bold as to make a suggestion to the men who play in the next world cup?  <br/><br/>Play like a woman.<br/><br/>Don't worry about your haircut so much.  No flopping, please!  keep the writhing in agony after a fall to a minimum.  Give 100% effort form the first minute of the match until it is over.  Men who represent their countries in the next world cup can learn a lot from the women who just finished this world cup.

Having borrowed from US banks in the 1990's large somes of money to efficiently run a small  chemical specialty business (75 employees) - I can tell you that they take a very keen interest in what is happening and offer advice (gratuitously?) all the time. Government rules and regulations make auditing of ones operations by a bank necessary! This has been acerbated by Sarbanes Oxley...<br/><br/>Auditing monies lent to Greece by the creditors seems to be an essential part of borrowing.<br/><br/>Danny P - Yes I actually know what a bank is like when it comes to telling you what you can do with their money, if you want to borrow, if you need to borrow you have to sign away your independence!

If hearing the Greek people's opinion is good for democracy, why do not we bestow the same goodness to the German people?  Let us ask Germans how much more they want pay for the Greek bill!  I want a referendum in Germany to sever all the ties with Greece.<br/><br/>ECB is wasting German taxpayer money on Greece without the consent of Germans.  With my money but without my approval, ECB is buying insolvent debt of Greece from private investors.  ECB is an authoritarian institution that does not represent my opinion or my people.

and isn't it amazing in what different ways somebody who is grown up in the US makes a moral statement - compared to somebody - who went to school in Europe?<br/>An American economists might not even put something like 'killed Puerto Ricans by guns' into his equation of judging a country - while it is the first thing which comes to a European mind.<br/><br/>And man! Greece is a Paradise!

Why are so many men so cynical in the commentary here?  It seems we should be more exorcised that so little attention is paid to men's health compared to women's health, especially considering how much longer women live than men!  Why aren't men concerned that society just accepts this?   If more refined screening helps catch prostate cancer early and therefore saves lives, let's study it more and act on it!  Women have fortunately paid more attention to their health in the past few decades to such a degree that they have 2 months for them - Women's Heart Month and  Breast Cancer Awareness month.  Don't we men care about our health and our families enough to do the same?  Let's follow the women and do the best we can for our health.

Since the European Union has reached its limit on loaning money to Greece, why can't it borrow from other lands, such as China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India?    It could issue 'Treasury' bonds just as the United States does.<br/><br/>The money received could go for extraordinary expenses, such as bailing out Greece.   <br/><br/>Furthermore, it might even be legal, in doing such a thing, to require that Greece must pay back, itself, the amount of the bonds sold to the other nations outside the European Union! (At first I thought of Greece itself getting loans, issuing bonds, but that is probably not allowable since it shares the common currency).<br/>So rather than Greece itself, getting help from elsewhere, the European Union would do it for Greece, and require however that Greece, by itself, or at least to a significant extent, repay the bonds issued over time.

What else should we delete? This is lunacy at best. To suggest we remove sugary drinks is insane and unrealistic. This is about choice-period. If someone wants to ingest 5, 20 0z's of regular cokes a day-God bless them, better them than me. We live in a world today where information is at our finger tips at all times. People have the right to pick and choose what they want at any given time regarding food choice. We have adequate nutritional values now posted in most food establishments, and on the labels of food that we buy at the market.<br/>People are in the know regarding what they are putting in their bodies. We live in a free world of choice- it is our God given right! Let the people have full dominion over their health, body and for God sake-what they want to drink! All things, albeit good, bad, or indifferent have consequences.

215725
Wouldn't it be better to put the "lessons" of the escape into a broader context of true prison reform?  <br/><br/>Years ago in the Times Sunday Magazine there was a wonderful article about a very humane prison (in Austria, as I recall).  The Times should go back to that article as well as consider some ideas from prisons in Spain and Norway, for a broader context within which to consider things like guards and screening for contraband.<br/><br/>If people are locked up, at times in solitary for long periods, unable to experience nature, for example, for dreadfully long sentences, without true rehabilitation, then the job of a guard or the craving for drugs or weapons is quite different from what a more human, less demoralizing environment would likely develop.  The use of color, of nature, work that involves not just laundry or kitchen duties but a chance for gardening of some type, views of weather In all seasons...  These things are missing!  And that is abnormal and destabilizing for a human being.<br/><br/>Unless we begin to treat prisoners as persons, how can we really deal with the culture that grows up in them?  How can we expect them to behave normally if we surround them with abnormal, punishing environments?<br/><br/>I am not a naive believer that everyone can be trusted.  Far from it.  But why stoop to a level of treatment which verges on torture?  Such an environment also negatively affects prison employees.  It is toxic for everyone involved!<br/><br/>Let's take a page from Pope Francis.

"Would you give your child a drug to keep him chilled out and watch him become addicted to it so that his use became out of control? That's just what the screen does over time."<br/><br/>What about the over-prescription of adderall to kids whose parents just don't want to "deal" with them?  Obsessive overuse of screens is just another symptom of the greater problem facing children today: parents who don't want to put in the effort to interact with and parent(!) their kids.

216137
I can easily imagine a structure where the existence of the debt is mutually acknowledged; the cost of managing it is shared appropriately between both those who took the risk by extending the indebtedness, and those who took on the indebtedness (in other words the answer to "who pays it back?" is... Both!). And the reality of the situation is also acknowledged, meaning no repayment owed until the economy is prospering, and even then, only enough of a percentage that will not return the economy to failure.<br/><br/>Let the economy grow, u encumbered, on its own terms. Let the debt be a manageable tax that is not burdensome to said economy.<br/><br/>It might take a thousand years to repay this way, but if so.... so be it.

216216
How are Greece's creditors bullying them into acquiescence when Greece refuses to repay its loans? Or to take the step necessary to rectify their economy??<br/><br/>Like Tsipras, Krugman seems to think the Greeks are entitled to funding from taxpayers in other countries - mostly the Germans. What's the point of lending them even more money when they will be in exactly the same place 3 years from now? Broke and unable to pay their debts!<br/><br/>The common currency cannot offer unlimited respite for countries that refuse to comply with the rules. There are guidelines for entering the Eurozone which the Greeks faked. Now it's time for them to leave the club as they do not qualify to be members. 

216221
Greece too big to fail? Maybe not, our stock market didn't go bananas with the "no" vote.<br/><br/>The real reason for this relative calm is two fold:<br/><br/>1. Everyone knew this likely to happen, and it had already been discounted in the market.<br/><br/>2. Greece's economy just isn't all that big.<br/><br/>If you borrow a line from Shakespeare - "...he gives—To every several man—seventy-five drachmas" - the worst case solution may be simpler than everyone thinks.<br/><br/>Greece is so heavily laden with Governmental workers, that fiat money may be quite feasible; if you pay everyone in drachmas, and you insist that all tax bills and fines be paid in drachma's, you are almost there.<br/><br/>If you can insist that all tourists pay their bills in drachmas, you might have enough foreign currency to keep everyone from starving; but certainly, this is a "Plan B". <br/><br/>"Plan A", is rolling already:  Varoufakis explores the underside of the bus ( a done deal ), the Germans stop calling Greeks lazy goofballs, and the Banks come up with a stretched out payment plan that "kicks the can" so far down the road, that all the negotiators will be in nursing homes before it's time for the next "can kick".<br/><br/>Happy days are here again!

Why can't Greece still be in the Eurozone, but off the Euro? The IMF needs to pump money into Greece for political reasons, not just economic ones. So, Greece will have its own currency, but still be part of the EU. It MUST be. The EU does not have a choice. Can Germany really accept an unfriendly or even hostile neighbor as close as Greece? No! But they must pay for a safe Eurozone. The U.S. knows this costs lots of money and we have been propping up economies for years. Not fun is it. Well that is the price of freedom and Germany, and Denmark, Sweden, etc. just have to get used to it. 

216415
And who created the offshore accounts that permit wealthy Greeks to avoid paying taxes? The banks! One of the more recent Greek proposals was to raise taxes on the upper 10% but the banks said no, they wanted more cuts to pensions and higher VAT taxes instead. Where is your disdain for Goldman Sachs which enabled the loans? What is really going on here?

216709
Why on earth does a working mother automatically equal screen time for a two year old? I work two jobs (one full time, one part time), with three children and no nanny. My four month old is exclusively on breast milk, and screen time for all kids is limited based on their age, the device in question, and the needs of the day. I don't find it burdensome or complicated, and while I would never insist that all women I know should do the same, for you to claim that this is unrealistic is just silly. Do you honestly think that working women who can't afford a nanny just plonk their kids in front of the television for the day? (And honestly, formula feeding my baby would blow our grocery budget and result in more sick days--since she's in daycare, breastfeeding when we are home helps protect her immune system so she's not constantly coming down with a cold--pretty handy for this working mom.) <br/><br/>Your suggestion seems poisonous to me: the idea that because I work I can't parent according to the needs of my kids. Balderdash, indeed!

Eight hours a day on a screen?? Oh my! I spend about that much time looking at a screen just at work (an engineering firm). Sure there are periodic meetings, phone calls, and face-to-faces... but most everything is done on a screen. Maybe they're on the right track after all?

216828
Really? that's all you took from this heart-wrenching story? All you saw were extremes? Nothing struck you about the fact that this has more to do with abject poverty and the lack of options they have? Just religion? <br/><br/>And nobody, especially Muslims, expects Saudi Arabia to help anyone but themselves. They've done nothing but spread radicalism across the Muslim world and now it's coming back to haunt them. So on behalf of the majority of Muslims across the world, please stop referring to Saudi as if it's the Muslim World's golden standard! Thank you

Is this what democracy is about to you?  One country borrows money from others and then simply votes that they have a right to demand more favorable terms for themselves after the money has all been spent?  And now, it's undemocratic for creditors to not simply shrug their shoulders and accept that the deal Greece willingly entered is being unilaterally changed.  By that logic, maybe the creditors' countries should vote and decide that they want to increase the interest rates on the debt!  That would be democracy too, right?  Would you blame Greece for refusing to adhere to such a thing?  Of course, that would be ridiculous!  Greece can't vote away their debt anymore than creditors' countries could vote to increase it.

ann1234 -<br/><br/>Do you have psoriasis? your characterization of this disease as "basically itching, some unsightly patches and dandruff" is not my experience, nor the experience of many, many people who suffer with this autoimmune disease. <br/><br/>I once had a dermatologist ask me how my psoriasis felt, I replied that it was super painful. He responded "No, psoriasis doesn't hurt, it just itches." This from a doctor! I wondered why he even asked the question in the first place.<br/><br/>In my experience, doctors will only prescribe aggressive, expensive, risky therapies for psoriasis (e.g., light treatment, some of the more toxic topicals, biologics) for those of us with continuous and progressive pain from the disease. Please do not continue to spread the idea that psoriasis is mostly a cosmetic inconvenience, it does so many of us harm who actually do need to access medical care.

“Greek Austerity” by Giuseppi Martino Buonaiuto<br/>A question that should be on<br/>Your mind this evening is why?<br/>Why are the people of Greece--<br/>Why is the nation of Greece--getting<br/>Spanked &amp; punished by their EU<br/>German &amp; French economic overlords?<br/>We should be saluting tonight’s<br/>Referendum NO vote results,<br/>The Greek electorate voting against another<br/>Devastating round of economic sanctions,<br/>Voting NO on more years of austere living.<br/>In fact, it should be U.S. foreign policy to<br/>Support complete Greek withdrawal from<br/>The European Union. That’s right:<br/>“Euro No, Drachma naí!”<br/>The EU is fiscal tyranny,<br/>Led by the EU autocrats,<br/>Angela Merkel &amp; whomever is sitting in the<br/>French baby’s high chair these days.

We have to ask: just what is Germany's end game? I'm guessing it is to annex Greece. "Lebensraum nach Süden." The Germans have always wanted a warm water port--and all that glorious beach and those islands! Priceless, well, almost priceless.

A Euro "Lehman moment" no?  As Yogi Berra said, "it's déjà vu all over again.". Or better Bill Murray, "it's Groundhog Day!"

_ Did any banker or German hold a gun to Greece's head and compelled them to lie about their nation's financial health in order to gain entry into the EU?<br/>YES! Goldman Sachs cooked the books along with Greece's then-leader to get into the EU and they should be in jail now!<br/><br/>- Did any banker or German hold a gun to Greece's when they cho(o)se to look the other way to rampant tax evasion?<br/>Ordinary Greeks have their taxes taken automatically out of their monthly paychecks, just like ordinary French people. RICH Greeks, and French, however, like many rich of other countries, have their wealth in tax havens.<br/><br/> Did any banker or German hold a gun to Greece's head when they created an unsustainable social welfare state?<br/>The Greeks were doing fine until they joined the Eurozone, as were the French. Southern Europeans should leave the Eurozone until the terms are not skewered in the favor of the wealthy ad, yes, the bankers.<br/><br/>Please read any New York Times article pertaining to Greece and/or the Euro by Krugman to have more details on these issues...

Montreal Moe:<br/><br/>eh? (Wicked!) (Ou cherchez la femme.)<br/><br/>Democracy and capitalism are quite compatible -- capitalism doesn't NEED to be unregulated.<br/><br/>And "democracy" is almost as old in France as here, though perhaps less notably successful if you count the guillotined heads; and much older in intermediate forms in Britain.<br/><br/>The problem with both Greece AND Germany is an acceptance of dependence; or, rather, a dependence on dependence. Germany is doing far better than Greece, but ask Mrs. merkel who's been walking her walls on their own dime while her children slept safely for 70 years.

Cohen's essay was "less strident"? Are you joking? I ask because my impression was the exact opposite. Krugman's essay was based on his well-known analysis of the effects of austerity in a depressed economy. An analysis, be it said, that seems difficult to refute if one's arguing in good faith. Cohen's piece, by way of contrast, seems to be based on nothing more than ideological hostility. Leave out the name calling (and he calls Tsipras childish!) and there's not much left.

Germany Sticks to Hard Line?<br/><br/>A nation as per Picketty is the 20th-century poster child for debt forgiveness.<br/><br/>Hear the opinion of Thomas Picketty who has mastered putting  economic issues into world-historical context and has some very strong opinions about the madness currently transpiring in Europe over Greece. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/07/06/thomas_piketty_on_the_greek_crises_the_star_economist_explains_why_germany.html" title="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/07/06/thomas_piketty_on_the_greek_crises_the_star_economist_explains_why_germany.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/07/06/thomas_piketty_on_the_gre...</a><br/><br/>"When I hear the Germans say that they maintain a very moral stance about debt and strongly believe that debts must be repaid, then I think: what a huge joke! Germany is the country that has never repaid its debts. It has no standing to lecture other nations.  After the war ended in 1945, Germany’s debt amounted to over 200% of its GDP. Ten years later, little of that remained: public debt was less than 20% of GDP. Around the same time, France managed a similarly artful turnaround. We never would have managed this unbelievably fast reduction in debt through the fiscal discipline that we today recommend to Greece. Instead, both of our states employed the second method with the three components that I mentioned, including debt relief. Think about the London Debt Agreement of 1953, where 60% of German foreign debt was cancelled and its internal debts were restructured".

Clinton campaign: are you reading these comments?!?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>You have my vote...but only if Bernie doesn't make it.

219110
1) so why isn't Bernie running as an independent as he identifies himself in the senate?<br/>2) how does he plan to work with the slow moving congress and move his ideas through the inertia?<br/>3) Hillary has been tested and tried as a senator and Secretary of State (just to name a few).  Every idea and belief that Bernie talks about, Hillary has been there advocating for all of us and never giving up until the job is complete!

219117
Why would anyone, except a cynic, vote for Clinton over Sanders? He actually believes in things--other than his own power hunger--and acts on those beliefs. Clinton--well, she just says what might get her elected. I see no contest here.<br/><br/>Go Bernie!

219534
And what drove the Southerners to seek independence? Surely not the desire to keep their slaves! It must have been something else........

219750
Does our enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders come as a surprise to anyone? Here we are in a period of unprecedented progress for Democratic causes with only lukewarm jubilation from Hillary's camp. She is so reserved and fearful of taking a stand, even with all of the momentum of a hugely improving economy, major strides for human rights, and the Supreme Court backing Obamacare... a project she initiated.  The universe is laying out the red carpet and inviting her to take center stage, yet she she will not sing the song we all long to hear! And Bernie is singing that song! Liberals are ready to take center stage. We are feeling happy and strong and we're longing for a leader with ENTHUSIASM.<br/><br/>Although I want a Democrat to fill Obama's shoes, backing Hillary has felt like eating a bowl of mushy over cooked veggies. Bernie is offering up organic fresh faire that to me is the natural path forward from all that Obama has/is setting in motion.

219780
Guess what those loans were taken out to pay for? Generous government pensions. In other words, they want to keep money they borrowed, as long as they never have to pay it back! Maybe they'll get away with it too since, amazingly, they've convinced many that they're the victims!

220097
Good jobs? Yes they can! But will they?<br/>And do it yet at real good pay?<br/>I won't hold my breath<br/>I fear t'would mean death,<br/>Utopia's still far away.

220242
an apolitical observation: with upward of 350 million in the "homeland", another Clinton? Really? Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama. . . Clinton?! Really? This is really the crème de la crème in the "Homeland" these days? REALLY? Just makes me sad there's no fresh talent being put up, you know, for the people.

If we adopt a perspective beyond next month, we are forced to ask the inevitable question: how much longer can Greece keep on receiving "aid" before it suffocates in its own debt? Economic bureaucrats in the Troika seem to believe that a balanced budget will do the trick, and Brussels sends people to root out corruption - a process which will take years, at best.<br/>Where to start? Between 2010 and 2014 Greece had a trade deficit of 52 billion Euro. Countries in a similar situation (although not quite as bad), have managed to recover thanks in part to having their own currency. Greece has its hands tied.<br/>The EU is reluctant to let Greece leave the Euro zone, because it would then lose control of the political development of the ccountry. The Euro is a lever to further "ever more integration" on a platform of pure market liberalism. What otherwise should have been an orderly, undramatic (although still problematic) transition from euro to drachme, has now been transferred to the political battle field. It will be interesting to see just how far Brussels is willing to go in order to keep Greece in the fold.<br/>One of Norway´s most distinguished economists, Erik Reinert, puts it thus: "The Greeks sit in a debtor´s prison. In England, the abolished the debtor´s prison in the 19th century because they found that people could not pay their debt when in prison. On the contrary." Good advice for the EU!

220317
Punishment?!? Greece is acting as a 7 year old brat whining, "Leave me alone. I'm all growed up." <br/><br/>Good luck with that kid.

220339
"Democratic process"?<br/>Lets have everyone who has mortgage, car or bank loans, or owes money to any creditor have a referendum : "Should your debts be cancelled and should you receive more money from your lender?"  and answer will be 100% "YES!".  That's  "democratic process", right?<br/>And if the lenders don't agree with the idea, that would be "punishment"!

220697
This editorial ignores the most important question - should anyone lend Greece any more money?  Greece claims to have a primary budget surplus so if they stop paying their debt (which they've already done) they should be able to move forward on their own.<br/><br/>The EU doesn't need to provide debt relief - Greece can decide on its own not to pay its debt.  But I suspect Greece really needs more loans.  Otherwise Tsipras would have followed this course already.  Message to the EU:  Don't send good money after bad!

220994
How much longer can Greece be kept in the Eurozone before it breaks down completely? Five years of relentless market liberalism has brought it very close. Every "aid package" has been accompanied by the usual neo-liberal demands; privatization and reduced public spending. It is easy enough to point to the economic folly in such a policy, but this is, sadly, the political foundation of the Union.<br/>60 years of a chafing, bureaucratized market liberalism has, at long last, been challenged, and Greece will pay the price. It sits in a debtor´s prison.<br/>The exchange rate of the Euro is obviously way too high for the Greek economy. Between 2010 and 2014, it accumulated a trade deficit of 52 billion Euro.<br/>In a normal international setting of international cooperation, the country would have been assisted in the transition from euro to drachme. Difficult, yes, but not dramatic. But letting Grecce leave the Eurozone would mean that the Union would lose its political leverage. It will be interesting to see just how far the EU is willing to go to keep Greece in the fold.<br/>In the weeks and months ahead we will see on clear display the prospects for democracy on the European level. If the political programme of Syriza, given the desperate situation in Greece, is not tolerated, we might just witness a gradual erosion of the EU. Political censorship is not for this continent!

221058
When one word, "heritage", is used over and over without forthcoming specifics, what is it hiding?<br/><br/>Digging down, here the heritage it claims to honor: in the words of a popularly elected South Carolina Senator, Ben Tillman:<br/>"In my State there were 135,000 negro voters, or negroes of voting age, and some 90,000 or 95,000 white voters. General Canby turned our State over to this majority. Now, I want to ask you, with a free vote and a fair count, how are you going to beat 135,000 by 95,000?<br/>We did not disfranchise the negroes until 1895.<br/>We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be equal to the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him."<br/><br/>He denies that "lust" of planters for their female workers who could not say no to their advances; he denies that racial coding is wrong; he denies he is wrong! <br/><br/>Much like those who deny the true legacy of the flag today. That flag is itself not a symbol of hate or heritage--but of denial of truth, justice, liberty for all. It flies as a special interest of only a few--who deny its symbolic and real association with denying freedom to others.<br/><br/>This is not heritage. It's denial pinned to the flag, the last battle being fought cleansing hearts broken by their own hidden iniquities. They have no contrition, nor share in the joys of others; only in the denial of their manifold transgressions.

221717
Land of Freedom, and Government of the people?   No more!<br/><br/>The American Military government has morphed into a fascist military police state that is the biggest mafia protection racket in human history.<br/><br/>With Mr. Comey, the F.B.I. Director, and Ms. Lynch, the Attorney General hailing from the prison city of New York, this story comes as no surprise.<br/><br/>I ask; why are critical infrastructure computers still connected to the open internet?<br/><br/>The Government seems to generate more fear of terrorist attacks than the terrorists.

221953
"Still revered?"  OF COURSE IT IS and to anyone who thinks for a split second that any SENSIBLE American is going to buy the argument that it's only about "Southern Pride" (as though "pride" has something to do with LOSING a war fought primarily over slavery) I can only say "sorry mister, but we ain't buyin' what you're sellin'!"  Oh, and YES the war WAS primarily about slavery so no "revisionist" history either, thank you just the same. 

222129
What, exactly, is the Southern Heritage that the stars and bars flag supposedly represents?  The states below the Mason-Dixon Line have actively obstructed voting rights for minorities, civil rights for gays and universal health care for the poor.  They have opposed everything that the first black President has put forward.  Is this the heritage they speak of?  What are these Rebels rebelling against?  The future?  Good luck with that!

222170
Why don't they start with their OWN ONE PERCENT instead? THIS WOULD BE A GREAT AND SHINING EXAMPLE!! But, no, they are untouched, regardless what Government prevails. It is easier to ask for additional money for the 1% from the EU as well.....

How long do you have to live in a place before it's your home? How do you define a Northern 'carpetbagger'?<br/>I recall asking this question back when South Africa's Apartheid system collapsed and some people were calling for the explusion (or outright murder) of all white Europeans. I asked how you can say a man whose ancestors came in the 1600s or 1700s or 1800s is not legitimately a native citizen, while someone who came from Mozambique or Congo two decades - or years, or weeks - ago has legitimacy denied to the first man, based on his skin. The response, of course, is either [crickets] or 'racist!' Ultimately, of course, Mandela prevailed at least superficially, because in addition to being extraordinarily decent, Mandela was practical: even if you hold title to the car, you don't shoot the guy who knows how to drive it.<br/>I'm asking the same question here with regard to Northern 'carpetbaggers'; I expect the same response.

Until a person has actually ridden-(rode?) a bike in NYC, especially Manhattan, either in traffic or not--you can have no idea what an awful rattling and bone jarring business it is! MAny Young men and kids male and female  can seem to shake it off, but usually they have more than the crummy 3 speeds .<br/><br/>   But regardless of Bike and road quality--this is not an experiment for ladies who also have to think about their handbag, clothes, shopping, shoes  and their makeup.

Why not coach a different team? It sounds like you genuinely enjoyed it. And that you were a decent coach. Why shouldn't you continue to have that experience? Last year for the first time my daughter had a coach who was not the parent of any kid on the team. This guy was awesome! And my eyes were kind of opened to the difference between a parent-coach and a non-parent-coach. I'm sure plenty of teams would love to have you.

The people? What about those who oppose it. And so what if we are among the few industrialized countries that still uses capital punishment! I'd rather live in their camp, then bed with the countries who allow it.

What to do when a home becomes expensive in retirement?  Downsize and move to a more affordable home!  It is true -- and too often misunderstood -- that beyond an alternative to renting living space, a home is not a productive, income-generating asset.  But property is, in most communities, valuable living space.  And the property taxes should reflect both the value living space is worth to a productive community resident, and should fairly share the burden of local expenses.  It is not unfair or wrong that if a retiree is unprepared for inflation in taxes, they should downsize.  Indeed, every property owner should absolutely be prepared to pay taxes to fund local services proportionate to the value of the property, adjusting both service costs and property for inflation.  <br/><br/>A retiree benefits from a local communities services just as much (if not more) than a younger, employed citizen -- and both should pay similarly for those benefits.  We all must pay for education (even educations received years ago), police, fire protection, parks, elderly services.  Sure, some of us benefited more yesterday, some benefit today, and for some the biggest benefit will be in the future.  But we should all pay along the way.<br/><br/>To do otherwise, as is advocated above, is to advocate petty, irresponsible, generational theft.  Let's call it what it is!

Blonder AND more Asian? Do tell! Can I see pictures?<br/><br/>LOL, I am an ordinary middle aged woman, pushing 60 with a short stick. I am not blonde or famous or beautiful and definitely NOT Asian, but I am still married.<br/><br/>My dad remarried at 66 -- to a woman a couple of years OLDER than him (also not beautiful or rich or Asian) -- and they were very happy until his death a few years ago.<br/><br/>I surely hope you are not going to "start a family" in your 60s -- yikes! -- but you could certainly be married IF YOU WANTED TO BE.<br/><br/>Internet dating has upended a lot of the old memes and expectations ("men will only marry young beautiful women, even if they are old geezers themselves"). Census statistics show that most men marry women very close to their own age, and in fact, something like 25% of all marriages are between men and women who are slightly older than them.

223353
Disneyesque fantasies about marriage? Is there are Disney film about MARRIAGE? I have never seen that one!<br/><br/>Sure some of the old Disney films (circa 1937) feature a fairy tale WEDDING at the finale -- but surely you know that a WEDDING is a party that lasts a few hours, and a marriage is something else entirely. You can be married without having any sort of "wedding" whatsoever.

223354
If you have a spouse, wouldn't he/she be with you on vacation, hence not available to feed your pets?<br/><br/>And a spouse can only drive you to your colonoscopy or the ER if he/she is relatively young -- fit -- healthy themselves. Not everyone has this. I have lost count of the friends and family that I have had to drive to colonoscopies, and they were mostly married or in relationships!<br/><br/>When Eccleasiastes says "two" , they mean "a man and a woman". Because there are two sexes and we are a species that reproduces sexually. They were not talking about "pals with benefits" or gay couples.

223375
'In light of the reparations and other conditions the allies imposed on Germany after WWI, shouldn't Germany know better? Haven't they learned anything?'<br/><br/>and as this is a question often asked - let's ask how much did Americans learn from the collapse o 2008? In light of the fact that most of them went trough it while I don't know a single German who wnet through what some 'Allies' imposed on them.<br/><br/>And I don't want to sound ignorant - but if people are completely unable to learn from events they experienced themselves how should they learn from some hysterical event?<br/>-And that's what my US friends always call it when I try to give them a 'historical' lesson - 'hysterical'!

ENTERTAINMENT?  Since the costs of death penalty case appeals are higher than for lifetime sentences, beyond the cruel and unusual punishment to the condemned, is the cruel and unusual exploitation of taxpayers for the entertainment value of execution.  How else could the excessive cost of executions be justified?  Because it provides satiation of the blood lust of a certain group of citizens?  Nothing in the Constitution provides for that.  As to Scalia, I think that he's confused in his dotage.  He views everything that he himself says as inviolate.  I guess he thinks that he's really the Pope.  Ah well, sorry to burst your bubble Nino.  Since we're developing programs for the early release of nonviolent criminals due to overcrowding and prohibitive costs, let's also extend that program to include dropping the death sentence by giving all those on death row to life sentences with no possibility of parole?  Save money and serve justice!

223441
What's next taking Lincoln &amp; Washington off the American currency? Let's focus on issues at hand concerning racism not some symbol from 150 years ago. Unfortunately times were different and if we start eradicating every piece of ephemera or symbol associated with slavery we would have to change the names of insurance companies, banks and colleges such as Brown here in the North, as we were as complicit with slavery as the South was. While we are at it we could change or eradicate Amazing Grace which was written by the slave trader John Newton. Enough already! 

223559
What? Precisely what does Greece produce? What do they export, except socialism. How do they impact Europe's economy let alone ours? If they were so integral, billions of Eurodollars would be flowing to the rescue. Instead, the well is dry!

Do you really think that will happen? Obama had lots of liberal promises too. Congress is the impediment and they are owned by special interest groups of all kinds. Let's face it,do you want a Republican in the White House? Get behind someone who can win! Sorry, my vote is for Hillary. She is smart, tough, and will be a fine first female president!

224320
If African Americans view this flag as a symbol of racism and they are an integral part of our society, why is this even an issue?  If a major population finds the Confederate flag offensive, surely we should have the sensitivity to not allow it to fly on public and governmental property.  The best analogy I can think of as a Jew is being offended with the Nazi swastika.  I surely would not want to see that flying anywhere.  Why does this not hold true for the Confederate flag?  There should be no argument about it.  Take it down!

How does the head scarf of Islam differ from the yarmulke of Judaism or the cross of Christianity?  Is it just a question of familiarity?  Would anyone object to the powdered wigs of our Founding Fathers?  But what if a man shows up looking as if he just arrived from the Saudi Arabian desert?  Scary?  Business and academic dress codes are little help where hesitantly prescribed or enforced and begrudgingly adhered to.<br/><br/>We in the West are increasingly tolerant of diversity and have adopted the practice of not hiding our faces or bodies, especially those of our women.  The problem may be solved by the gradual yet inexorable shift away from religion.  Clothing in general will become less and less of a statement about who you really are: the wannabes always appear the social climber, the affluent practice dressing down incognito.<br/><br/>Once, during my student days, the President of the community college issued a memo that no female employee come to work in a pantsuit, whereupon the Dean of Students promptly wore one the next day!  Clothing, customs and other obvious trappings of a religious nature may rub us the wrong way, but we need to learn to shrug it off.  In the end, we all are subject to daily social approbation and disapproval.<br/><br/>Freiheit, freiheit, über alles!<br/><br/>Chevy<br/>South Hadley, MA

Why would anyone want a constant reminder that their side decisively lost a war? All they should see when they look at this flag is: your ancestors are losers!  They were beaten, and they were beaten badly by a side that fought with one hand tied behind their back. In my view, if they want to be constantly reminded that they are losers, let them.

224433
And just what do you call the Confederate hellhole prisoner of war camp, Andersonville- a resort style summer camp? War crimes are never war crimes until the war is over. Face it, we are all sinners and flawed humans. My suggestion- do unto others as you would have them do to you!

What was Lehman's debt as a percentage of GDP, before its failure triggered a collapse of the global financial system?<br/>Point being, it is *irrelevant* what the GDP number in the denominator was...get it?<br/>Suppose I owe someone 2 dollars and I only have 1 dollar.<br/>It does not matter what GDP is because if I cannot pay, then I will default.<br/>Further, suppose the bank that I owe that dollar needs it to pay their creditors...and so on, and so on.<br/>GDP is *Irrelevant* when you have markets cascading lower by the hour!<br/>It's called financial contagion and that potential contagion effect has not been removed. If you think it has, then you simply do not understand the nature of the global markets, today.<br/>and, from what I'm reading here, many of you do not...you have no idea what the difference between, say, a credit default swap and interest rate futures options spread is...admit it.

"Plumb ridiculous"? If I remember my history correctly, the Confederate flag was the flag of treason, so why on earth should we extol the virtue of treason in addition to its obvious racial overtones; e.g., slavery!

Don't listen to Scalia?  Ha, as though any "thinking" person would.  Don't listen to Breyer?  Well, I don't see what we shouldn't but, ok.  How about JUSTICE HARRY BLACKMUN?  A one-time death penalty advocate, in his 85th year he wrote from the bench in his lone dissent the following: "From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death."  Does THAT work for ya?!

Factual?  What are you talking about?!   Stats show that there is no link between undocumented immigration and crime.   A sensationalized singular event is exactly that.  

226104
Bill, what war debts are you talking about? Those "debts" were reparations imposed by the victorious Allies and not money borrowed by Germany. While the Marshall Plan was vital to get Germany and Europe restarted after WWII, the Germans worked hard and paid their taxes on time. Two things which most of the Greeks today have been unwilling to do for quite a while. Germany has repaid all of the monies received from the Marshall Plan long ago!<br/>Your comments are just another example of passe German bashing.<br/>By the way, a large numbers of Germans want to help Greece but don't see an end in sight. Germany has given and lent a large amount a large amount of money to Greece already which was spent on things that Greece should have collected taxes for.

226107
How can you write "Shame on Europe and Germany?" Greece got themselves into their own debt and did NOT have to take one iota of currency from Europe and Germany! Greece chose to. I say Shame on Greece. Go Grexit!

Let's just do a simple arithmetic problem:  If you start with 100 cod and you eat 96 of them, how many are left?  That's right -- 4....  Now, if you eat 3 of those, how many are left?  Right again!  One!<br/>How's that going to work out for your kids and their kids?  Hmmm, are we just talking about cod, or is it everything we use on Planet Earth.....

What kind of philosophy is this? Revenge alone is not avalid justification of punishment. Never!! And you think it is cheaper to kill, wow!!

Logical?<br/><br/>"bottom line: German and Eurocrat leaders are simply trying to bail out their banks for having made loans they KNEW they never should have made in the first place at the expense of already-sufferring Greeks. Stupid Germans!"<br/><br/>Such commenters typically add that even more such loans should be made to Greece right now. Can't the same thing be said -- only more so -- about any such new loans? 

226970
Mike: And they needed the loans initially to do what?  To keep paying out the salaries and pensions of government workers, which most definitely did "help the Greek people."  I know it is hard for Americans to understand, but the civil sector in Greece is enormously bloated and cannot be compared to the U.S. government work force. Go into a Greek consulate or any other Greek public office and you will see 9 people sitting around drinking coffee while perhaps one person is working and the line of customers winds around the block.  Every election, no matter which party (left or right), such jobs were given away as a way of buying votes -- along with exorbitant pension promises to farmers and others who never paid a cent into the system.   <br/><br/>And despite the crisis, this mentality has not changed.  The best example of this is the announcement by the Tsipras government last week before the referendum that public transportation in Athens was free.  Yippee!  No cost!! Another little favor to buy off the voters. But public transportation is not free, bus and subway drivers, maintenance people have to be paid, facilities have to be cleaned, materials have to be purchased, and who is going to pay for that?  The citizens of the other 18 eurozone countries once again?

Why wasn't this prominently featured in the Sunday Sports section?  I think it should have been on the front with features about the players, analysis of the games, etc..  Women are playing in the finals at the World Cup and the NYT doesn't give visible coverage in the Sports Section? Really?!!

Accidentally? The value of such a key is worth significant sacrifice (one's own life). "They" have your wife and daughters. "You", the government functionary, are going to withhold those keys? In practice, that's rarely been the case, with *much* less at stake!

Hasn't Greece been bailed out like 3 times already?  They are willing to do it a 4th time but are calling for tighter controls on how they run their economy...shocking!!

Why should Bush be held responsible for the lies he inherited from Clinton? Why is it it Bush's fault that the Democrat CIA Director he inherited from Clinton lied to him?<br/><br/>Despite being saddled with Clinton's lies, Bush still managed to win the Iraq war! Obama inherited a stable Iraq. Biden promised Iraq would be Obama's greatest achievement. Instead, Obama created ISIS and gave them Iraq.

What is "austerity"? How did this come to indicate a sort of unquestioned evil, like genocide, say -- so that one has the moral high ground merely by standing on a soap box and shouting "Shame, shame, you are trying to inflict Austerity upon us!"<br/><br/>Who gets to decide what constitutes Austerity? I don't like the terms you are proposing in order to 'lend' me more funds (on top of past loans we both know I will never pay back). After all, those terms will make my life harder than it's been -- not, harder than it would be without the new funds, but harder than it's been. I don't want things to be harder than they've been! Do I get to decide that what you are proposing is Austerity, and if I so decide shall we all then shame you? Does Paul Krugman decide? How does this work?

MISSION POSSIBLE?  Having worked extensively as a psychologist evaluating children, many of whom were involved in foster placement, I have observed at firsthand the parents and extended family who were unable or unwilling to provide adequate care for the children in the first place.  In extreme cases, mothers with severe mental illness had up to 13 children, none of whom were ever given into their custody due to drugs in the bodies of the children at birth.  What all children need is strong positive attachments to caregivers, but caregivers must be capable of providing stable, nurturing relationships.  Many caregivers have, themselves, been severely damaged emotionally due to abuse and/or neglect.  If you really want to change things, begin by providing intensive support for newly expectant mothers and continue that through life.  Just as they do in Denmark.  Anything short of cradle to grave social support of families is less than all citizens deserve.  But the 1% have rigged the system so that they get 99% of all new profits, leaving very little for child welfare.  Then you've got people who want to shut the government down.  I guess they think that failed states like Somalia provide better care for families than we do in the US?  Give more to the 99% and take back from the 1% if you really want to change things!  The rest is so much hot air.

ACTING DA?  If Cox isn't fit enough to be appointed officially to the job, what does that say about the overall competence and fairness of the legal system if Caddo Parish?  As a psychologist, I find his statement that someone found guilty of a heinous crime should suffer as much as possible before dying to be clear evidence of distorted thinking, based on psychopathology related, in part, to his documented depression.  Meaning that it seems that he should be removed immediately and prevented from practicing law as an impaired professional.  Cox is required, as everyone else in the legal system, to operate under a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.  His remarks are especially egregious since he is speaking of cases which may not yet have been adjudicated.  Further, his ethics are highly questionable if he prosecutes for further crimes after haven extracted a plea bargain from a criminal.  The first step in fixing Caddo Parish is suspending Cox immediately with intent to dismiss and to have formal complaints made against his license to the State Bar.  What happens to him, if he has an afterlife, is of no concern whatever.  He must be called to account for his violations of basic ethics and public trust in this lifetime.  His actions are a blot upon the record of human rights in this nation.  They are as extreme in their cruelty as those criminals he abominates, by he himself perpetrating abominations.  In the name of Justice?  Absolutely not!

Should there be a stigma to being fat?<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY!<br/><br/>Less than 1-2% of the US has a metabolic/endocrine imbalance that causes they to gain weight which they can not lose.<br/><br/>The other 63-64% that are over-weight have only one thing to blame - themselves.<br/><br/>As one of my physicians at the Cleveland CLinic put it (when we were talking about the problems of caring for the fat &amp; obese) "No one ever came out of a concentration or prisoner of war camp fat.  Less food, more exercise."<br/><br/>The chubbies frequently claim they are "healthy" because they don't have symptoms of diabetes or other bad lab results.  (That is right after claiming that BMI is nonsense because 'ya know, this isn't fat, it is muscle so I weigh more"  Uh -huh....)<br/><br/>That is nonsense.   Every extra pound beyond the correct weight (&amp; that means more like a 19-12 BMI where the ribs can be felt easily) puts extra strain on the joints &amp; spine.   <br/><br/>Hips and knees can be replaced.  Spines can not.<br/><br/>A leading cause of spinal problems like degenerative spondylosis (arthritis)  is being fat.  As these people age, they are looking at degenerative spinal conditions - brought on &amp; then aggravated by being fat. <br/><br/>So yes exercise is an answer - problem is that fatties are exercising the wrong thing. They are exercising their elbow to move their hand to their mouth rather than moving all of themselves a lot.<br/><br/>BTW of course an employer does not want fat employees. They are out ill more (whining about how their back hurts etc)

As the parent of an obese (now 18 yr old) child am I doing the right thing by  pointing out that being obese diminishes their prospects in society as this article confirms?<br/>In this case the weight problem was clearly caused by hoarding and consuming cheap calories.( There may be a genetic pre-disposition but I know not to have high calorie low nutrition food in the house but I can't control my child when all they need is a handful of change to buy 2000 calories of the stuff!).<br/>What is frustrating as a parent is that no-one wants to or knows how to address this problem directly. I don't believe the solution is that complicated but as a parent it is an uphill struggle with no support from Doctors or teachers - because of this idea that being overweight means that individual belongs to a minority whose rights need protecting. Doctors and teachers just don't want to take a position.<br/>What about Alchoholics and addicts? Why is it permissible not to directly address the problem of weight like we do with other addictions?

After all that Greece has gone through, after all that the Eurozone has gone through, after a referendum, a resignation, a new FM they come to a last-ditch-meeting without their plans in writing? What kind of madness is that?<br/><br/>The Greeks should know by now that the EU is a orderly institution (I read somewhere that the regulations of importing caramel bonbons into the EU is 27000 words long, go figure). If the EU says that Greece can apply for ESM emergency credits that means they _actually and physically_ have to fill out a form. Yes, it's that bureaucratic!<br/><br/>Not filling out that form, not presenting your case in writing (as a required attachment to that form), just standing there with your hat in one hand and the other raised to beg for money is not how the EU works. Thinking they can get away with another round of "Game Theory" is wrong. By now even Junker has noticed that he's been had for months and has started banging the podium!<br/><br/>I see no basis for cooperation anymore. The next summit on Sunday will end as all summits. I just hope it will be the last. I wish my Chancellor would stand at a podium and say: "Let the world blame Germany, we don't care, we'll get the blame anyway, but we are through with these people, enough is enough, we will no longer tolerate liars and thieves in our midst, Greece, you have been voted of the premise, go and drill a hole in your head, we don't care!". But that would take courage...

Remember how President Obama figuratively crushed<br/>Trumps skull at the Press Club dinner a few short years ago?<br/>Remember the look of total mortification on Trumps face!?<br/>Club him with his own sarcasm, and crudeness, and watch<br/>the imbecile retreat in horror.

Wanted gift"? Au contraire, D. Trump is an extraordinarily accurate portrait of Republicans in 2015.<br/><br/>He isn't denounced in uncertain terms by other would-be Republican presidential nominees for one simple reason: Trump echos the sentiments of Republican voters! He is now ranked 2nd among the announced candidates, for example. Trump's sentiments are precisely those of  most registered Republicans. Perhaps the columnist would like to imagine that Republicans represent some other rational minority, or majority, but they don't.<br/><br/>The only real debate in the pre-presidential contest is Clinton vs Sanders. Recall when Wm Clinton represented the faux Republicans circa 1992 and was elected by a minority thanks to the 3rd party candidacy of Perot (19% of the vote). The game of musical chairs among Republicans in 2015 is just that: a game unrelated to finding good answers to a whole series is overwhelming problems, social, economic, environmental, diplomatic. Imagine the Texas governor (to take just one) making judgments about Yemen, for example ("Yemen? Where in tarnation's that? South of Dallas?").

Benson:<br/><br/>Why does Tamino religiously avoid HadCRUT4 &amp; RSS?<br/>Couldn't be confirmation bias!<br/><br/>Gavin's post on Real [sic.] Climate proclaims in boldface that including sea surface temperatures cools the trend (which would occur under land only measurements). Except under Karl et al, where they do the opposite. <br/><br/>Did you miss that part?

Who is going to pay for all of this?  I know, let's use that money from the Exxon settlement!  Wait a minute, it's gone?  They settled for less?<br/>Meanwhile, they're building the new Tappan Zee without secure funding.<br/>A great pair of Governors,  those two.<br/>BTW, this column written by someone from Art and Design.  Where's the money coming from?  Who's going to pay for all of this?

229565
'Wasted"? Trumpis a breath of Fresh Air simultaneously exposing the hypocrisy of the Liberal media and telling it like it is on the issue of illegalimmigration and the lack of border security. Unlike the weasel politicians, including the current occupant of the White House, who say one thing and do another, Trump is a true American patriot and those Americans not brainwashed by PC ideology recognize this and have vaulted him into the lead of several polls of Republican voters. Could he have worded the order of his comments differently? Absolutely! But anyone with an IQ higher than a rock understood he was not calling 'all' illegals' rapists and murderers but merely highlighting the high number of criminals coming across our unprotected border.

229652
Huh? What does this have to do with Greece? And you do know that the people in that region are net tax donors, don't you? Their money gets sucked out and sent to the rural red states -- last figure I saw was $2000 per person per year, and that was years ago!<br/><br/>Take Amtrak -- the Northeast Corridor is the *only* part of Amtrak that makes money! What loses money? Long distance lines. So we're hugely subsidizing grandma's overnight trip to Chicago.

229762
Have you not heard of the Greenspan/Bernanke/Yellen put? Not different in practice. "Stocks only go up!"

229984
Huh? This is so confused in so many ways...<br/>Why was it OK for Nixon to go to China and the USSR, start detente, and so on? At the time, they were just as bad, if not worse, than Cuba.<br/>Why was it OK to trade with the Eastern Bloc (all evil communist dictatorships) back in the cold war? Czech beer, Polish hams, Yugos ... all were here in the US well before the 1990s...<br/>Why is it OK today to trade with China &amp; Viet Nam?<br/>Why is it OK today for South Korea to trade with the North (at least, when the North isn't having a hissy fit)?<br/>Why is it OK to condemn "Obama's outreach" for not having done anything useful in the several months it's been going on but implicitly not condemn the previous policy which lasted 50 years and has nothing to show for it?<br/><br/>On the other hand perhaps this Op Ed piece is wonderful after all.  It shows that America is truly a free country, a "Land of Opportunity". After all, if a person like Rubio can become a Senator and run for President ... why, the possibilities for the rest of us are truly unlimited!<br/><br/>/s/ A Rockefeller Republican<br/><br/>While no one can conclusively prove that X or Y was the ultimate cause of the demise of the USSR &amp; Eastern Bloc, a fair argument can be made that "because a McDonald's has opened" in the East, the people started seeing that the West's life style was a lot better than theirs ... they started demanding change, and eventually got it. 

229999
You think Trump "irritates"  liberals? Ha! This liberal loves him.  Couldn't have asked for a better candidate to carry forward the Conservative movement.  Unlike Santorum,  Cruz and Walker who all are thinking the same thing,  Trump actually says it out loud. Keep talking Donald,  you are doing great!

230207
WHERE'S SARAH?  Palin, just when we need her the most?  If she could only give lessons in rhetoric and clarity of thought to The Donald, that would hone his redoubtable skills as an orator.  Nay, as a political philosopher.  Or he could realize what Sarah did:  there's much more money to be made as a political commentator and pundit (pun intended) than as a candidate.  But the Donald is awash with money.  The danger for him is that if he ascends to political office (imagine him ascending as if to Heaven on a fiery steed), while he may have money to burn, he may achieve Dubya's reverse Midas Touch, which would cause him to turn gold into poop.  But given the piles Trump is trumpeting around town, stepping into his dumps seems to trouble him not at all.  Indeed, he seems to enjoy wallowing in his own filth.  Raise a joyful stench!  Perhaps what he truly aspires to is to become the Mud Wrestler In Chief.  Still, his greatest inspiration would be to invite Sarah to be his VP Candidate.  Oh the brilliance that will be smeared across the land, the tsunami of execrence.  All that is lacking in the scenario to make it truly superb is the Union Jack.

How long ago was it that we heard spontaneous outbursts of courage like "Have you no shame?" or "I paid for this microphone!" Fighting words anchored in fairness and decency.

Trump's "erratic and conspiratorial temperament"?   Just Trump?   You're kidding me.  The entire Republican response to President Obama has been erratic and conspiratorial for 7 years!   There is no better word than "conspiratorial" to describe it, and Peter Wehner here is doing nothing but add to it.  This piece tries to makes Trump look like an outlier, but only as a foil for the rest of the messy Republican field.  We have the greatest circus midway of Republican candidates that God ever created.  Trump is no outlier, he's right in the middle of the error bars.  

230571
What's this guy thinking? Asking for new loans when his prime minister is at the same time...<br/><br/>"insisted that any deal should include debt relief, and he emphasized that the Greek crisis was essentially a European problem."<br/><br/>The Greeks know how to throw plates -- and how to throw good money after bad money!

I found that odd; all her friends are drug dealers or troublemakers? How long will it take for those types to find her in her new home? She didn't end up being friends with losers "by accident". It was part of her lifestyle.<br/><br/>I live in a modest inner ring suburb in the Rustbelt. It has been the location of choice for Section 8 housing for years, and the foreclosure crisis put that on greased rails. The influx of poor, dysfunctional families -- teenage kids who party, do drugs or are loud -- robberies, break-ins, home invasions -- we now have pan handlers at the bus stops -- and of course, rental properties that are dirty and badly maintained by absentee landlords (chortling as they cash those above-market Section 8 checks!). It has totally changed the character, let alone the safety, of a once lovely area -- and driven away most of the middle class homeowners, including BLACK middle class homeowners, who did not move here to be surrounded by the same loser-types and welfare families they LEFT back in the ghetto.

230663
If Bush and Rubio cannot stand up to Donald Trump then how will they stand up to Putin or ISIS or Communist China?<br/><br/>Bush's response to Trump's insult about Bush's wife was the Bernard Shaw moment of this early campaign.   Referring, of course, to the 1988 presidential debates when CNN's Bernard Shaw asked Mike Dukakis if he would call for the death penalty for someone who brutally raped and murdered his wife.<br/><br/>Dukakis's passive, calm, professorial answer in the face of such an inflammatory question pretty much handed the election to vice president Bush at that moment.<br/><br/>Heck, in Jeb's response to Trump he even said that Trump is a smart guy!  That's tellin' 'em Jeb!

Is it our privilege to decide the marital, medical, and legal relationships of strangers? Is faith more important than mercy? Must women and minorities submit to men and majorities? Is it okay to work on the Sabbath, and when does that day begin and end? Must we stone to death our rebellious children? Are we obligated to feed, clothe, shelter, teach, employ, care for, and protect the hungry, naked, homeless, uneducated, jobless, disabled, and vulnerable? May we drink alcohol, or eat shellfish? Is it appropriate for us to confidently define the histories, character, motives, and worth of people we don’t know, and to treat them accordingly? Which commands, from which scripture, must we follow, and which may we ignore? Are foreigners ours to attack and enslave, and their property ours to take? When we offend others’ spiritual/existential beliefs, is that as profane as when they offend ours?<br/><br/>Do all of the members of any religious denomination, let alone of any religion, agree on the answers to all of these questions? <br/><br/>We live in a crowded theater. Is it good to express our "Fire!" simply because we can? We have our beliefs, and they have theirs. Are only ours sacred? They have their values, and we have ours. Are only ours inviolate? Both we and they have lives, and find loves, and make choices. Are only ours rightful?<br/><br/>Whatever happened to humility? Whatever happened to compassion? Whatever happened to the Golden Rule?<br/><br/>In fact, whatever happened to "their" freedom of religion?

Senator Rubio, as you look down upon Cuba, has it occurred to you that nations who keep diplomatic relations with the US are not thrilled with our record, either?  Offhand, the American government has practiced torture illegally, started an unjust war whose destructive ramifications are still being felt, continuously blindly supports the Israelis’ land-thefts, allows access to weapons unthinkable elsewhere, treats guaranteed health coverage contentiously, on and on!   So, while Cuba is not perfect, neither are we, yet people understand that communication is always more productive than freezes.

So you would like a President who takes a stand for racism?  This is the same garbage that people used to say about Jesse Helms - "he speaks his mind!" Yes, and it was the mind of a racist and a homophobe.

Republicans view the economy as a bigger version of their households--which nearly everyone can intuitively grasp: "Earning less? Spend less, or else fall into hopeless debt." As individuals, they may have grasped Economics 101 (Micro) but either dropped out or failed to grasp 102 (Macro), fuggedabout Money &amp; Banking! The Micro view is appreciated by most ordinary individuals who have no grasp whatsoever of macroeconomic policy, say nothing of monetary policy. It may be intuitive, but it's wrong, plain and simple, and once an individual reaches adulthood firmly rooted in ignorance, it's hard, maybe impossible, to get a new lesson across, try however Prof. Krugman may try (though here's hoping he keeps on trying!). <br/><br/>There's absolutely no guarantee that ignorance won't win out in politics (look at the period 2001-2009), while there's a pretty good guarantee that it will fail when it's enacted as policy.

Geriatric Rulers? Looks like Marco is being manipulated by some of those as well! This was a "gimme" op-ed to prove to his AGING, anti-Castro [donor] constituents in South Florida that he'll continue to stand firm against the Castro regime.  And he chides people for living in yesterday? He needs to realize if you are old as the voting block in Florida, you have no choice- because odds are you may not be around tomorrow.

Then why is everything else but weight determined by genetics? Eye color, skin color, disease proclivity, type of nails, hair, etc. My mother - 6 feet tall and model thin, my sister as well. My father and I, short and chubby. And my mother and sister could out eat my father and I by a factor of 3 and still not gain. Not genetics, you say - really?!?!? 

231981
I wonder what the Castro/Cuban government's opinion on the state of affairs on the streets of America in 2015? How many young black men have been killed this year so far? A church shooting and rampant inner-city crime prevails through-out the U.S. this summer, Mr. Rubio. <br/><br/>Opening normal relations with Cuba is a true reflection of our own state-of-affairs. We are far from perfect and so is Cuba but all relationships are based on some form of trust and hope for the future. Bravo President Obama for doing what should have been done years ago!

232047
If (As?) the Greek economy is so broken, then surely, the European and international community (including private investors/companies) should be looking at some way of (profitably) supporting and building the economy instead of the endless argy-bargying of politicians trying to bring it to its knees. What good is a down-and-out bled-dry Greece to anyone except those foreigners who want to buy holidays homes on Greek islands at firesale prices? Let's all drink Ouzo!

Why not turn our elections into a reality game show? The Super Pacs could not only produce and direct the show, but could bring in additional revenue by creating their own advertising. <br/><br/>Just think about it. A new "Keeping Up With the Kardashian's" but this time as a senate race. The character (candidates) could be featured in People magazine and their publicists could manage their tweets and Facebook posts. In fact why even bother with costly voting booths and all that bureaucracy? <br/><br/>Let's do an American Idol style vote and have viewers simply pull out their cell phones and call in for your favorite candidate (for a small charge of course) It could be a weekly show with some candidates being let go at the end of each episode, of course with some consolation prize like a lobbying contract.<br/><br/>Money, money , money...it's not the root of all evil. That's some old Puritan tale. PAC money will not only be a better way to run elections it will also make them fun and entertaining. Most importantly, it will make more money as each election show brings in millions in TV revenue! Imagine PAC's as independent production company's.<br/><br/>Move over Jeopardy! Our new show, "Keeping Up With the Candidates" will be the reality show of the season. Brought to you by PAC's who are dedicated to making the dreary game of politics fun and entertaining and most importantly, profitable!

So, he's popular on FOX? Ted Cruz (the Senator "tail-Gunner Joe" McCarthy look-alike) avers that Trump "speaks the truth".  The Donald was a Democrat till he became a Republican, a birther, a Conservative. Trump's ethos is "me-me-me" and he is not an effective public-speaker or demagogue beyond his wild bloviating, which, alas, does stir the masses.  His bluster is terrifying - an anti-immigration fence built on the US's southern border with Mexico (like the great wall in "poor"China?) - a military planner bigger and better than anyone else, "the greatest jobs President that God ever created". a "great relationship with Vladimir Putin" (PLEASE!), a secret solution to the defeat of ISIS, The New Caliphate! Grotesque phantasms and chimeras spring from his Edsel mouth and fluffy spun hair-topped head. His stands on Obama - that he is a Muslim, "a psycho", not a natural-born American citizen, and so on. Donald Trump is witless, a taunter and name-caller, but can't be wished away or dislodged by the grim plethora of wannabe POTUS Republican candidates.  Can't be whisked away by a Deus ex Machina.  Must be confronted by his party members (though he used to be a Democrat, more's the pity) and demolished - figuratively speaking - or he will do unspeakable damage to the GOP within the coming 17 months til Election 2016.  Mr. Trump, who has never held an elected office, is the Republican's 800 lb gorilla nightmare. Will the GOP wake up and smell the coffee before Election 2016?

Yeah, how ABOUT it? Take a look at the boxes of crappy kid's cereal next time you're at the grocery store! You can barely see the name of the sugar-infested garbage for the pics/ads of/for monster-superhero movies that cover the front of the boxes! Kids will shriek like banshees if Mom doesn't buy the stuff, and then shriek ever louder once they've eaten the stuff from he sugar buzz from hell they have.

I can't help but ask: If a symbol can cause such anguish and do so as only a distant reminder that slavery once existed in this country, how long ago? 150 years? How can those sensitive souls who still remain in such a tormenting bereavement over that injustice and those that imposed it, allow even the utterance of the "S" word while still being able to somehow manage their daily lives. My hat's off to them! What courage! Talk about a stiff upper lip.

And that is the responsibility of Merkel? How about Tsipras and the rest of the Syriza government putting together a WPA-like program of their own to get the Greek people working. I get the feeling they prefer to sit around in cafes all day drinking kafenion, playing tavli and complaining about the Germans, French and anyone else to waste time. Stop kicking the proverbial can down the road!

I read yr column in today's NYT with great chock, I mean, have you ever heard about ythe underlaying problems in Greek economy/society? You sound like a puril 19-yr old student on a semi-radical American university. Plse, some mature and competence!

232811
Sound familiar? It should to those of us in the United States! China, for its lauded ability to copy our processes, could not steer clear of the same pitfalls. Now, they get to live with deleveraging and even get to implement their own form of quantitative easing ... Let's see how far that $2 trillion of reserves will get them, in trying to keep air inside the bubble. 

232863
Does this sound familiar to anyone in the United States? It should because we are still going through deleveraging from the Great Recession (so called). China, for all its abilities in copying our processes, could not steer clear of the pitfalls. Now the Chinese get to implement their version of QE with the $2 trillion of reserves. This emphasizes the point that we are all not in a true market economy, since the regulators continue to dictate asset prices!!

232907
Gee - you'd think the French and German banks that lent Greece all that money knew it, though, wouldn't you?  So - maybe they knew this borrower was a poor credit risk, and knew they might lose the principal.  Oh, that's right, only silly normal businesses bear the risk of bad decisions; banks can have their governments act as collection agents for them.  Sweet!  (well, not for the Greeks, but whatever).

233010
and trying to read now as much comments in US newspapers about the Greece Crisis as possible - what a disaster for the American progressive left? <br/><br/>So many comments now - which blame governement spending as the main culprit fort Greene going belly up - as US progressives just forgot to put the blame for Greeces Crisis mainly on the corrupt system of the Greek Oligarchs <br/><br/>And now every German progressive hast to fight with this stupid idea that tue US Left hast been siding with a corrupt and greedy system and successful progressive governmental stimulus - like in most other European Countries gets a very bad rap.<br/><br/>NO THANKS!

The Chinese economy isn't the 24 karat gold standard that can do no wrong? You don't say!<br/><br/>Perhaps now we can be a little more realistic. The Chinese political system is fundamentally broken and the Party has quelled uprisings only through the promise of bigger and bigger gains. Such growth cannot by definition continue forever.

@ Jagneel  Oceanside, CA<br/>Excuse me, and just how do you know all this?---You do realize that New York  recently founded its own expansion team right here in the city (and NOT New Jersey), don't you?<br/>When you start spending millions on drafting European Premier League players, it's not just that people can gawk at the teams! --- It's the game!!!<br/>Oh, and I can tell Real from Barca....it's called MESSI.

You say you're old enough to remember that the "Dump Johnson" movement didn't work? I guess you forgot that it DID work! LBJ dropped out of the campaign in March 1968, two weeks after Gene McCarthy nearly beat him in New Hampshire and Bobby Kennedy jumped in the race. Maybe you were remembering the "Dump the Hump" movement to defeat Hubert Humphrey; that failed, yes. Largely because of Sirhan Sirhan.

4 bankruptcies are "better than our national approach to public finance"???<br/>Sheesh!<br/><br/>And exactly what "invasion" are we suffering?<br/><br/>I think this whole thing is to cover up the fact that Trump's wife came here illegally. (That was a joke. Kind of.)

WHERE?  Descartes had to flee France because his philosophical views were deemed to be a threat to existing order.  Cartesian logic and the divine right of kings don't mix.  So he moved to the Netherlands where, if not appreciated, he was permitted to philosophize undisturbed.  But his follower, Spinoza, was not safe there, as he was excommunicated by the Sephardic Jewish community, of which he was a part, had fled the Spanish Inquisition to be able to practice its orthodoxies that clashed with his radical idea that God and nature were one and the same.  Hannah Arendt, though free to pursue her philosophy on the Upper West Side of NY, had to flea Nazi Germany, being Jewish.  And where was Moses when he wrote down the Torah and received the Ten Commandments?  Not in Egypt!  Then there's Plato's cave.  And Walden Pond.  To me, then, philosophy is where you find it, think it and create it.

So a law requires that birth control be 'free' and the NYTimes prints an article about how that has led to a sharp decline in out of pocket spending?!  Do writers for the NYTimes ever go to college or take a course in 101 economics, or do they just think the readers don't have a clue?<br/><br/>My out of pocket spending on birth control is zero and has been for some time, but my out of pocket spending on meds I actually use has more than tripled since 2010.  My out of pocket family spend has done the same; my premiums have doubled in just 3 years.  <br/><br/>But an interesting study might be to see who is 'not' spending what they used to on birth control.  The people that used to buy it are now getting it for free, because of an unproven theory by Sebelious and her third party consultants that claim if birth control is free, unwanted births will decrease.  That may happen for some that get an IUD - you don't have to remember to take it, although it is (was) very expensive.  <br/><br/>But what about the real target group for this faux theory?  The poor.  Have we seen a decline in the moms that have multiple babies with multiple dads and then live off the government subsidies and monthly checks?  You know, the moms that don't really care for their kids - the kids that grow up on the streets, abandoned by parental love and care until they meet up with gangs?  How's that working?

234006
Hello?  You take a comment that states that 'free' isn't ever free - truth, really it is - and somehow start talking about racist red states and the people that live in them?  You indicate that the commenter is saying 'free' makes them made because it's free for black people?!  Just who is the racist here?<br/><br/>And BTW, ER visits have gone up, not down.  Nationwide, but especially in the blue states.  So just what was the point again of your comment?

234165
Of course, this wouldn't have ANYTHING to do with the sell off in Chinese markets, and the imminent threat to the Euro via the Gexit, would it? The NYSE takes care of its own, as usual! I wonder how long the 1% can keep their little charade up and running.

234212
Can Angela really top the unmitigated disaster of 2 Bush presidents and the havoc it still reeks? Hardly. So, just skip it! The American fashion of blaming others for their own mistakes - like the Greeks do - doesn't work all the time. They voted for that idiot Tsipras!

234219
Shut the country down for decades? Decades, you say? Gosh, that sounds terribly terrifying. Decades, even. Goodness!<br/><br/>"Welcome to America (closed for repairs until 2040)"

Why is anyone even listening to this? Let Greece be absorbed by the  the Russian federation, and demand loan repayment from Russia! Russia is a socialist state, right? And Greeks are socialists. Sounds perfect. 

234495
Does America want such a poorly educated man to be in a position of power at the national level? He dodged important questions during his re-election bid.  In his quest for the candidacy, he has dodged even more.  Some say he doesn't want to make any mistakes in his quest for high office.  Walker lacks the knowledge because he probably doesn't read and is briefed by the Koch crowd.  He's a dangerous person because of his ignorance.  He is not courageous, he is weak!

234634
Why believe anything NYSE says?  Reminding you that all the markets and foreign exchanges are rigged against YOU!  The big companies, the exchanges, and the world's big banks, World Bank, EU are the 1% and have created a Ponzi scheme that is starting to unravel.  EU does not want to aid Greece as this was all planned in advance. Let each country leave the EU and their plans fall apart.<br/>All the banks of the world are connected...what happened in Greece will happen here. Who keeps money in a bank with no interest....new regs will come that YOU will have to pay the bank to keep your money in their building.

234639
Move on? No way! His remarks, as you point out, are indeed "crude and vile" and the media's attention may be explained by your reason #2 (reason #1 seems kind of unlikely). Nevertheless, his growing popularity (more likely the REAL reason he's getting all this coverage, though I understand that it's a chicken and egg question) is important because it so vividly illustrates the fact that many people's thinking in this country IS crude and vile. If it weren't, Trump wouldn't be getting this kind of support. Let's shine a spotlight on these people.

235169
And exactly what will Greece do??? They have been saying this now for several years and each time they promise to do something, they get further into debt. You have fundamentally the same people in charge that have nursed it along and have shown they can accomplish nothing. <br/><br/>If I were the banks, I would say a resounding NO! Greece has no plan. It is sick and on the verge of dying. Methinks this is a patient that is too far gone, you might as well pull the plug. 

235482
So you are a marxist feminist concerned about race and class issues? No, I guess Hilary won't speak to you, but then no mainstream candidate could. Because, she is a feminist who works for the benefit of all people regardless of class and race around the world. Short of a political revolution which will not be happening here anytime soon, your form of feminism is so out of touch. What kind of woman is she for? What kind of ignorant comment are you making? Feminists like Hilary have been fighting around the world for the rights of women, girls, gays . . . Did you think the fight for wage equality was aimed at the corporate sector. No it is about every cent in a dollar making a difference to working women. Get educated about feminism in this country because you know nothing about it!

Why should they "allow" anyone to take their spots in the tennis world? They better earn it like Venus &amp; Serena did...it wasn't handed to them on a silver platter!

Cut to the bone, you say? Greece had more fat to trim than the other countries (Ireland, Portugal, etc) who accepted austerity and have since bounced back. Losing weight is painful - but good for you! Some examples: <br/><br/>Retirement age raised from 55 (50 for females) to a more reasonable standard cerca 65.<br/><br/>Jobs being declassified from the classification of "dangerous" which allowed workers to retire after 25 years. While reasonable for firefighters and military men, hairdressers were also included in this category (oh, the toxins!). In 2006, 1/3 of those retiring using the largest private pension fund came from these sorts of jobs.<br/><br/>Pension being cut from 96% of last-year salary.<br/><br/>I agree that Greece needs some form of debt relief and that the loans aren't going to get repaid. Hardly anyone nowadays argues that they will be. I suspect Germany and its cohort are holding to their hard-line-principles because they think that's the only way to obtain a successful negotiation with semi-facorable terms, just as the Greeks stick to their no-more-austerity cry for the same reason. It's just politics.

236204
What about social media? From what I can tell BERNIE SANDERS has a very sophisticated online presence. Too bad journalists have time only to report on the weight of Hillary's money rather than the uplift of Bernie's message.<br/><br/>Perhaps, in the future, under President Sanders, everyone will be talking about how the press, myopically focused on his inability to win, actually spurred him on to victory!

236208
My next questions would be: since you like Sanders, but don't feel he can win, what have you done to better his chances?  Have you donated to his campaign?  Attended any rallies?  Spoken to your friends/family/colleagues/neighbors about his ideas for a better America?  Will you volunteer?  Offer to drive people to the polls?  I have and I will.  Stop the naysaying and offer real support for the candidate you believe in!

The Opinion Article "President Donald Trump? Just Say No" interested me because of the candidates that are currently running. The Donald Trump incident  is all over social media, including a fight over Danny Zuker, writer of Modern Family.<br/><br/>It's crazy to see many sides against and for Trump. He's classified as Republican but for the past decade was a Democrat. This opinion article is clearly biased against Trump, pointing out his flaws. <br/><br/>With Trump's remarks towards the Hispanic group, many felt offended and were against him, losing him many possible votes. I felt like the drama between politics is hilarious and because I'm so young, I don't clearly understand everything, except for the obvious dramatic debate.<br/><br/>Another reason why I'm interested is because of how big Trump is. He's rich!<br/>I just want to experience the pros and  cons of all of our candidates such as: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Jeb Bush.

Can the Greeks hear their own dissonance? "We are a courageous people! We are too proud to accept the conditions you offer. Now, turn the money machine back on before we really get mad."

When has feminism EVER been single issue? Feminism got you the right to vote, go to college, have credit in your own name so you can a loan for a car, house or college; leave a bad marriage via divorce instead of a pine box, get custody of your children, apply for jobs that aren't advertised as male/female in the classifieds (as they were when I was young), paid child-care leave, etc etc.<br/><br/>Are there still battles to be won? You bet! and you get to pick up the torch for the ones that interest you. But if you like the rights you already have, thank a woman old enough to be your mother. And congratulations, you ARE a feminist.

Jonathan,<br/><br/>is it possible that you are asking me such a kind of questions?!<br/><br/>Don’t ask me about the death sentences at all. Do you know what your best line of defence is? Don’t commit a crime at all. Don’t kill anybody and they will never have a chance to sentence you to death.<br/><br/>That way you are saving two lives. <br/><br/>Do you know how many people are killed in black-on-black violence? Why don’t you try to stop those killings in the first place?<br/><br/>Multiply that by thousands and thousands of death sentences are we might save dozens thousands human lives.

237211
So someone tell me WHY we would have to PAY for this discussion?<br/>Makes no sense to me.<br/>Conversation should go like this; "Doc, give me the morphine"!

What are "European levels" of unemployment, exactly? Spain's 24%, Italy's 14%, or Greece's 25%?<br/><br/>Greece does not have 90% tax evasion. It was about the same as Italy's, but today Greece is actually among one of the best tax collectors in Europe. Trouble is, the economy got so weak from austerity, and wages fell so sharply, there is not enough tax to collect! 

237312
Although this type of planning makes perfect sense, there will always be opposition from another side (pro-life? pro-extended death? pro-it's my wife/husband/sister/brother etc...and I will sue anyone who tries to uphold their wishes).<br/><br/>Heck, my own father has told me...in no uncertain terms..."Do NOT pull the plug, Do NOT sign a DNR, revive me forever."  I mean, he told me to make the doctors keep trying, FOREVER!  And that was 2 years before he was diagnosed with Alzheimers.  Just how committed should I be to his wishes, that were made when he was sane?  I say, I have to do what he asked me to.  He knew, and he made his decision while he was able to.  So, when I'm at the hospital, and all of the doctors, and medics, are looking at me like I'm crazy...I'm not.  I'm following my father's explicit wish.

237362
Doesn't Greece have very many companies that make a good profit, and are not those companies actually taxed, so they have to pay revenue for the government in Athens?   Yes, but it isn't enough to pay for all the fattened pensions, for the early retirees, the social programs and safety net for the unemployed and poor.<br/>In order to pay for that, some of those companies need to be revitalized, in the manner that the prudent owners of profitable business do it in nations like Germany and in Scandinavia.<br/>So they need to be bought out, it's just that simple ... so that can be done!<br/>It reminds me that various under-performing states in the U.S. could similarly be brought forward to profitability, rather than continuing to have to be subsidized at great expense, by the federal government, with so-called block grants and other means that started a few decades ago,<br/>like under the Nixon administration, starting taking the U.S. down that road to huge, and by now, intractable, National Debt.

237530
Why is this self-promoting blowhard being dignified with so much analytical 'news' coverage?  <br/><br/>THAT should be the real question!  Trump was, is, and always will be a relentlessly self-promoting caricature who lives on the 'news' coverage he generates.  That's his whole career!  And now he is gaming the political system and the news media, who should dismiss him for what he is.<br/><br/>Making a media sideshow out of presidential politics merely degraded the political process further...IF that's possible.  Why does news media allow itself to be used like this?

237958
Why the surprise here? In 2001, the U.S. turned the evolving democratic values of over 200 years on their head because of the attacks. That the APA and psychologists were involved in this insanity is not surprising!

@ Rudolf — “Zero competition”? You either don’t know what you’re talking about, or are indifferent to reality. Either way, you’ve demonstrated that rational readers should be indifferent to what you have to say.<br/><br/>Oh — your critique of the parade is that it’s “political overkill . . . [for] kicking a ball”? Some friendly advice: you really should do at least basic research before you start spinning out assumptions about whether a particular event is fitting, or out of proportion to its underlying significance.<br/><br/>The most recent ticker tape parades in New York, prior to today’s, have been for the NY Yankees’ World Series titles in 2000 and 2009, and the NY Giants’ Super Bowl championships in 2009 and 2012. On those occasions, did you go out of your way to grumble that •those• ticker-tape parades were “political overkill” for batting or throwing a ball?<br/><br/>(Note, by the way, that there is definitely precedent for parades honoring athletes that aren’t based in New York — one example was the 1984 parade honoring the U.S. Summer Olympics medalists.)<br/><br/>Basically, you don’t like the enthusiasm that a lot of Americans have for the national team, and how thrilled they are at the championship the team has won. That’s fine; it’s a free country! You’re even at liberty to tell us all how you feel.<br/><br/>But don’t try to dress up your personal sentiments with rationalizations that are so transparently bogus that the only reasonable response is to dismiss your statements out of hand.<br/><br/>— Brian

"Alarming" that the Civil Rights Movement caused distress and distrust between the South's blacks and whites? Of course it did! I grew up in the South in the 1940s. In the 1960s, during the Civil Rights era, our small town was ripped to shreds by the two "sides," which were poles apart. Most cross-divide good feelings evaporated. Relationships disintegrated. If that is not too cute a term. My doctor father refused to support the Private Academy that our county developed in order to sidestep the integration of schools. He was ostracized by his erstwhile admiring patients. His Methodist missionary sister came to town to teach the school-less black children in one of the black churches. At the same time, that brave father was performing hysterectomies on young black women without their consent. And that brave aunt said she was supporting the Supreme Court, however she felt about her the capacities of her black neighbors. Those of us, black and white, growing up in those years were trying to find balance in an emotionally bombed-out zone. I moved away as soon as I could, and lived in the integrated Midwest and East, returning 20 years later only to support a loved black woman in her old age. The place was still an emotional - and economic - battlefield. The book Lee wrote could not have been published then. She sweetened the tale and we have the lovely "Mockingbird." But "Watchman" is the truth that could not be told until now.

Whatever could have taken so long for this to be discovered and revealed??   It should be shouted from the rooftops, as many of us have attempted to do!   Even our President and VP at the time was part of it.  There are many, and I repeat MANY, members of our government who knew, endorsed, and participated in the torture directly or indirectly, and have not yet received even a reprimand. The whole matter is much too lengthy to be covered in the pages of the New York Times.  But it is easy to describe who will pay the highest price far into the future:  any American GI who becomes a future POW will suffer the same treatment we meted out at abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and other secret sites.  That future torture has already been seen in the beheadings of prisoners by ISIS.  I sincerely hope our military recruiters explain the situation to each and every person who visits a military recruiting office.  Those young people deserve at least that much forewarning.

You don't seem to have followed this very closely? The total debt of about 300B is held jointly by the Eurozone countries (with about 100B coming from Germany), the IMF and the ECB. They had to take this debt *from* private investors because Greece could not have paid those back at the rates that they were demanding (and in the process about half the debt was also forgiven already by the way, contrary to persistent myths that "the poor Greeks never got any debt relief, oh those dastardly Germans!". The rates the Eurozone/IMF/ECB have granted Greece are extremely low and stretched out and could not be had by private investors.  So how would you envision would one find anyone who would even *want* to buy the Greek debt, if it is completely clear that such an investor would immediately and certainly lose their money? Or do you think such investors could scare the Greeks with calls from a collection agency into paying up?!

I seem to recall reading a very long and detailed article about a meeting in Virginia, (West Virginia?), or somewhere outside of but near the Penatgon. The people invited and who attended this get together were all sorts of GOP and Conservative minded business men and people intent on making at least a bunble and maybe a few, on the coming war in the Middle East. They sold all sorts of armor, new magic bullets , bomb detection equipment and , tons of training tools. The basic theme was that this was going to be Big and little business's war to fight and win=-and the most important aspect was to make a lotta lootta while the sun was still shining on the operation. I recall how stupid the idea of invading a new nation , at a time we had not even begun to get comfy in Afghanistan seemed to me. But the Business interests didn't cvare--to these crawlers, it was money, money and more moolah, more fastah!<br/>I cannot recall who wrote it-but, it seems to me that there aree only 52 issues of Sunday NYTimes magazine a year and that it should be easy for anyone with the time to find the article. Clearly, though, these two had either been 9in Virginia or had heard about it and knew what an easy mark our military were for anything that even remotely sounded professorial and as though it might be "sciencey".

Inexplicable reason?<br/><br/>Very easy. Fear from repeating Lehman and subprime desaster. US financial break down caused the whole crisis, and now everybode has fealt on it's own: "Money is just confidence, and when confidence disappears it is nothing worth".<br/><br/>Everybody, especially the US gov was (and is) primarily afraid that the dept crisis and bank crashes could affect the world economy.<br/>We German tax payers (primarily) have saved you in Switzerland, (and in the US) from a new large economy crisis by saving south European countries.<br/>Switzerland, Norway and other rich European countries were only watching! And now we are the only country being insulted from US media and government! Anti-Germanism this is.<br/><br/>In fact, US have organized a media war front against Germany because they are afraid, Russia or China could gain influences, if they helped Greece. I don't think any other country would be so silly to give money to Greece- but Germany is called diabolic, if they only hesitate?

I posted this a while ago but didn't get through, maybe it was too harsh on the NY Times? I'll try again.<br/><br/>The NYT is creating a parallel universe regarding situation in Greece.<br/><br/>The demands on Greece are not punitive!<br/>They are a reform program as anyone who looks them over calmly can see! Reforms that had already agreed to by Greece for over 5 years.<br/>The reforms come with exceptionally generous financial and institutional support and continued membership in one of the most benevolent and beneficial communities of states ever. <br/><br/>It is not a ploy by Germany gone mad -- it is the united will of the people of Europe, demanding that a member that will need another 100 billion on top of many hundred billions before play by the rules and builds an economy and society that does not spend much more than it produces.<br/><br/>To repeat: this is a reform program, to help Greece!<br/>This is not "mindless austerity", "vengefulness" and no, the money did not all go to the banks (it went to the Greeks first, from the banks, the Greeks then spent it).<br/><br/>It is somewhat disturbing to see how well-meaning and highly-educated people, i.e. the NYT writers and their readers, create an entirely fictional parallel reality and then succumb to what is almost hysteria about what they see happening in that reality.<br/>The NYT readers can be excused as usually it is safe to rely on the NYT for an accurate explanation of things.<br/>But, to paraphrase, "the reporting on Greece is a disaster for the NY Times".

What is it about republicans that want their kids to go to war rather than negotiate? Or perhaps it's, "those other kids", that go, not theirs.<br/>Maybe it's so they can call more dead kids, "heroes".

How many of these articles do we have to read over the years?  She is a great player.  Does it matter that she acted like everyone was against her always and she acted badly sometimes?  Isn't that the same as Bobby Knight or a hundred other athletes?  Everyone has to take negativism from others every so often.  She should be happy - with herself - and get on with it.  There are lots of athletes that people don't like.  There are lots of people who are criticized for you-name-it.  On that topic, this country is way too focused on appearance, and the people the media thinks looks great are ten times as messed up as your "regular" person.  Oh, and I dislike Roger fancy little costumes....and I wouldn't dream of thinking anything she wore was out of bounds.  There is an article on this same topic in the New Yorker.  Live your Life Serena!  Have fun!  Who cares what people say about you.  Be happy for your own sake.

The most annoying thing about these types of transients is that they are constantly justifying their moving to Jersey by saying what a diverse new town they moved to with all their neighbors being expats from Brooklyn too-- the only problem being that none of those people are really from Brooklyn, so why is it so important to justify their moving to Jersey? Why do they feel the need to explain that they moved to a suburb with a bunch of other people who probably originally grew up in a suburb, but then moved to Brooklyn for a few years and then moved back to a suburb? Only now their claim to fame is that their neighbors are transients like them that just happened to live in Brooklyn for a little while too? And their only 20 minutes away from the city-- without traffic of course... yeah, right!<br/>If I was from jersey, I would take this as an affront, like people who grew up and live in jersey their whole lives aren't as cultured as people who lived in Brooklyn for a few years?

Holy cow, who funded this study? Pure malarkey! Hubby and I just celebrated 25 wedding anniversary with a two week road trip, had a superb time. Yet I couldn't balance on one leg for all the tea in China and then one leg while writing? Never mind the nonsense I'd compose — would say anything to end the circus act. <br/><br/>Do not recall having the adeptness to balance on one leg even when younger. Couldn't catch a ball either. Physical coordination is hardly a happy love life indicator. <br/><br/>Klutziness has its own humor — wit with humor most assuredly essential relationship ingredients. A different kind of balancing art.

How broadly do we extend the umbrella? Is it the most significant moderators? Is it all moderators? Or is it truly all "users"? And how does everyone get an equal share or is there some formula to reward the most worthy? <br/><br/>So let's say you just include everyone because, well, that gives everyone a reason to behave. There's not really any revenue now, but let's assume that Reddit finds a way to get just as much revenue as Facebook. That's somewhere between $2 and $3 per user, if I remember correctly. So each person gets a whopping $2 to $3 for looking at ads. Whoo hoo! <br/><br/>With numbers that small, there will be pressure to follow the lead of "Animal Farm" and make some folks more equal than others. But that will anger the folks who are left out and since the stock will probably be public, everyone will find out the numbers. <br/><br/>Also, with numbers this small, there won't be much sacrifice to joining the dark side. If someone wants to be anti-social and annoy others, well, not much can happen. Let's say a really noxious person manages to cut revenue by 10%, a big number of a normal company. That's a whopping sacrifice of 20 to 30 cents.   Even if the rest of the shareholders managed to gang up  and strip this bad person of their shares-- a legally complicated process-- it would only be $2 to $3 lost. <br/><br/>Alas, I think it's a bit more complicated that turboprinting a bunch of stock certificates.

"So is there anything at all here suggesting that it’s OK to impose further fiscal tightening on Greece, that this won’t deepen its depression?"<br/><br/>You are a broken record!<br/><br/>Is this an austerity package? No and no. Ninety percent of it is an economic reform package -- and a long overdue one. <br/><br/>It's funny, but in the past five months of this blog I don't recall any discussion of the fact that the Greek economy was broken. Nor was there any recognition that throwing more money at a dysfunctional economy would make things worse by removing pressure to make reforms. Instead all ideas for reforming Greece's economy were contemptuously dismissed as "austerity."

You blame Greece for telling it's creditors the truth?  The only crime that Tsipras' team did was to tell the truth to power that didn't want to hear the truth.  I repeat, the creditors refused to hear the truth that the IMF is now agreeing is true!  Could his Finance Minister been more circumspect with his language?  Probably.  But that wouldn't have changed a thing!<br/><br/>And how does punishing Tsipras or Syriza accomplish anything?  This is the 1st time in 70 years that their party has come even close to power in Greece, and their only demand has been that it's creditors recognize the truth and deal with it instead of kicking the can down the road again.

Germany is manipulating currency, but USA are the circle of the most honest economy? Wow.<br/>Just tell me why the Euro was beaten by the dollar down under 80 Cent and then, when USA realized, they wanted a weak Dollar, this just happened and Euro was worth $1,4.<br/>The US as others are trying to push their currency down, the Euro is the only currency not taking part because they believe in the faith of the others.<br/><br/>Basically the Americans tell every day another story. If we have an own currency they are saying our economical success comes from that, if we do what everybody wants and joing the Euro we are the bad guys again. And on parts where America is more successful they are saying, look this is because we are superior!<br/><br/>I think there is no "fair" economy thinkable by Americans where they are not the most successful in everything. Anybody being successful is cheating and manipulating.

"Can this possibly make sense given the extremity of the situation?"<br/><br/>Taking a very long view . . . YES!<br/><br/>If your real motive is to pursue the New Elite Agenda of:<br/><br/>a) restoring historical inequalities in wealth;<br/><br/>b) revoking the Modern Era ideals of Democracy and Self-determination; and<br/><br/>c) transferring strategic monopolies, tax farms and other valuable assets into private control.<br/><br/>Stripped of its ephemera, the history of the human race until the Modern Era was a story of psychopaths competing with one another to attain power, then using that power to dominate and brutalise their fellow human beings.<br/><br/>If that behaviour appeared to change in the Modern Era it was not because of any evolution in human psychology.  It was simply that the structure of the industrial state - the need to invest vast amounts in training large numbers of subjects to operate complex but not fully automated machinery - made it expedient for the Elite to offer those highly trained subjects a better deal.<br/><br/>That era has passed.  Robotics and automation are quickly making these people redundant.  The negotiating advantage has swung back in favour of the Elite.<br/><br/>And the Elite is simply in the process of restoring its historical privileges.<br/><br/>As Charles I remarked, "A Sovereign and a Subject are clean different things." Or Alexander Hamilton:  "All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well born, the other the mass of the people."<br/><br/>Welcome to the New World!

This very bad Iran Deal is a repeat of our North Korea experiment, ignore the regimes' evil insanity, sit across a lovely table with lovely flower arrangements and sparkling water, look cool and stern, cool and stern, then sign a piece of paper, pat ourselves on the back, spin the pretense, and what happens in the real world? Iran, like North Korea builds their nuclear warheads. Alas, unlike Kim who is content to sit and eat bon bond, Iran's Mullahs are much more committed to destruction.  And the kicker!  Iran is now working with North Korea on their nuclear program.  Who's smiling now Mr. President?

“If I had a magic wand, what is it you would wish for today?” This is a question I ask of my patients receiving hospice and palliative care.  No one has ever asked that I rid them of their disease."  Really?  I have incurable, stage IV cancer.  I am 55 and receiving palliative care and probably will never receive curative care.  You ask me this question and the first words out of my mouth will be "rid me of this disease!"  I can't believe I'm the only person with an incurable disease that thinks this way.

Do they protest the rampant paving over of the Hill Country with cheap developer sprawl? (Lady Bird Johnson must be spinning in her grave) Do they protest the rewriting of science &amp; history in the new textbooks approved by their Education propaganda wing?

It would have been better to have kept those manufacturing jobs ("our jobs") here at home even if it meant producing often shoddier, more expensive products and subordinating living standards and wealth to "job security"? What of technological advance or productivity growth? Is it not a positive to have the broadest division of labor possible, to encourage the free-flow of capital and people? Seeking efficiency in production is exploitative?<br/><br/>Economic life is in constant flux. Trying to stop that is foolish. By making us all poorer, protectionism, in time, will hurt the very workers it means to protect. Half of the NYTimes readership acts as if it's a piacular offense to manufacture anything overseas; or that incorporation itself is iniquitous. It's illuminating to read Hayek and Mises, even if the only goal is to comprehend your opposition.<br/><br/>The cretins of Texas have to take responsibility in educating themselves out of their own parochial world. You guys' reasoning is as follows: Their livelihoods have been stolen from them by Corporate America, and they in their simplemindedness have been duped into believing the President is trying to impose martial law via Jade Helm. Poor them! That Southerners are victims of false consciousness is said by the sequacious -- they vote for the GOP because of their fundamentalism; or because of their ignorance-induced fear, racism, and prejudice; or, more typically, both. So? Take your pity elsewhere.

Why is the only solution to use other people's money (opm)?  Raise gas taxes to subsidize mass transit (opm)!  US taxpayers (opm).  Low fares (opm).  <br/><br/>The answer is to let the users pay for commuter trains.  Then the light will shine on the transit authority, construction workers and the like.  Let those of use the roads pay for the roads, those who use the airports pay for the airports and those who use mass transit pay for mass transit.<br/><br/>Take this out of the hands of politicians, boards and authorities and put back accountability.

Yes, but which player will play which candidate?<br/>We don't know what the 2015-2016 SNL line-up will be.<br/>However, there is only one female among the GOP candidates, and she won't make the top 10, so it wouldn't be any fun to play her.<br/>I can see Kenan Thompson as Ben Carson and Bobbie Moynihan can do Chris Christie.<br/>But after years of having many white males, the cast is now pretty thin here, at least, when it comes to white males who can play politicians.<br/>I mean, who wouldn't want to play Donald Trump?<br/>And who would want to play Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush? Boring!

Aren't there studies showing that treatment results are actually better if there's a high level of rapport between doctor and patient? And if there are, wouldn't seeking a doctor with whom you have that rapport just be seeking "evidence-based medicine"? I think that personality click is really important. I am fortunate to have it now with my wonderful doctor, and when she retires I will move heaven and earth to find it again with someone else. There WILL be shopping involved! And it's not just personality I'll be looking for, but a similar approach to things -- like prioritizing nutritional and lifestyle approaches over drugs, KNOWING anything about nutritional solutions (so few doctors do), having a similar attitude about when to do something and when to "wait and see," etc. Next time I am looking for a doctor, I will be planning to interview several of them before choosing one. You'd do that when hiring a colleague at work. This is an important working relationship. Why treat it any differently?

Why pay someone else to entertain your little one? Put your "money" (time, actually) where  your mouth is! We had eager Scouts but no Cub Scout Day camp director, so Yours Truly and husband volunteered. It snowballed. We enjoyed a decade of hundreds of shivering swimmers, triumphant archers, obstacle courses, tree identification, games, skits, and happy campers who slept on the way home. Eventually we taught at National Day Camp School. The pride and satisfaction I felt after those August weeks still keeps me smiling. It keeps you close to your child, and you get to know his or her friends, too.

Partially - but you neglect the fact that when mainstream center-left political correctness becomes so stultifying that well-meaning people feel they can't even raise policy questions (sanctuary cities?!) without being personally attacked, right-wing demagogues fill the breach.

"In the courts" is a little late for a remedy, don't you think?  Sandra Bland is dead.  Her family will never hold her again, talk with her, experience joy with her. They will never enjoy her future with her.  She has none. How will her life be remedied in the courts?  How will her death be justified???  My heart hurts to see her family grieving. She was sent off to Texas to start a new job, a new life. Her family's grief must be inconsolable. I sense that if she did commit suicide, it was because she was so deeply humiliated by this experience, she might have despaired over losing the job she had not quite begun; perhaps she saw that her life was finished once she had been jailed.  If you can't see that this arresting officer was out of line, take another look at the video.  He commented to another officer that it was all on video, only it was not, Ms. Bland went to the ground without the police video on her.  Police need to be professional, not bullying, not condescending.  If a "suspect" is irritated, it is the officer's job to deescalate the incident.  This type of incident, which happens all too often, is a shameful reflection on this country.  The "officious intermeddler", very fortunately, got the real deal on video!  One does not need to be a person of color to see the injustice of this incident.  One only needs to be human.

Hillary Rodham Clinton being investigated by the Justice Department?  I wonder how long the investigation will take?  I wonder if the Justice Department will fast track the investigation?  Could the results of a Justice Department investigation already have a forgone outcome of innocents?  After all Hillary Clinton is a Democrat running for the Office of President of the USA.  Let's face it most Americans who pay attention already know in their heart that the Hillary's E-mail scandal  is just another example of typical Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Is Hillary simply above the law?  Is Hillary too Big of a Personality to be prosecuted by the Justice Department who happens to work for a Democrat President.  My guess is yes, too big! Nothing will come of this "so-called" investigation.

If a Hollywood actor sleeps with the casting director of a movie in order to get a part, should he or she be denied an Academy Award?<br/><br/>I find it appalling  --  though not surprising  --  that so many commenters flaunt their ignorance and self-righteousness regarding steroids and baseball much as many do regarding politics.<br/><br/>The currently Most Recommended comment says, "[Bonds] should never make the hall, EVER. PERIOD. The same with any other admitted and/or convicted steroid cheat." The fact is Bonds has never admitted to or been convicted of being a steroid cheat.<br/><br/>The next Most Recommended says, "Baseball fans are FED UP with ...all their (utterly bogus) 'records'!" Pitching mounds that are raised or lowered at owners' whims, operations that move around or wire together body parts, drugs that kill pain, outfield fences deployed to accommodate particular players: I love records, but it is pure fantasy to pretend that all stats are acquired equally. <br/><br/>How was stitching together Schilling's foot and loading him up with drugs for the 2004 Red Sox-Yankees playoff any more natural than taking steroids? <br/><br/>The owners wanted big TV contracts, and TV wanted something non-fans could understand and that worked for endless replays, something to compete with basketball's slam-dunk. The result was steroids and home runs. Whether it was smart for a player to do it to his body is a separate issue from the fact that home runs were a good line on a job application.

So let me get this straight: they are classifying parts of the documents retroactively and then demanding to know why she didn't release them as classified documents? I'm still waiting for the sturm und drang re: Colin Powell's emails as SOS, or John Kerry's, or Jeb Bush's as Governor of Florida. It was common practice to use private email servers - but this fits much too nicely into the HILLARY IS UNTRUSTWORTHY!! narrative that has been very carefully and forcefully promoted for years. Other politicians lie with impunity but every word out of HRC's mouth is parsed and twisted and distorted for nefarious motives. This has political hit job written all over it. And Trey Gowdy?

A fictional character in a work of fiction does what?!?<br/><br/>Brother Hugh, a character from Ralph Ellison's The Invisible Man, was a much more effective critique of white folks' motives when black folks are the subject.  However, that character was intended to mock the well-intending white leftist, who is deeply in love with his/her own good intentions, and not so much concerned with the well-being of African-Americans, as with the feeling (and possibly promotion?) that one gets when one acts like one is concerned with the well-being of African-Americans.<br/><br/>That is not a character or a critique which the Times will be endorsing, or otherwise drawing attention to, any time soon.

It's no different than the question "Did my smoking cigarettes for 50 years cause my lung cancer?"<br/><br/>Frankly, no one knows for sure! We know cigarettes cause cancer. But do we know that YOUR cancer was caused by them? There simply is no way of knowing. But it doesn't invalidate the fact that cigarettes cause cancer.<br/><br/>By the same token, we KNOW the ACA is having a downward effect on the cost of healthcare in America. How much? Who knows?<br/><br/>And frankly, who cares? I'm 63, and the last couple years are the only ones of my life where the average cost of healthcare actually declined!

Ms Gay presumes that Ms Bland should not have been pulled over, but why? White people get pulled over too! And, the fact is an officer is trying to assess some one he pulls over for etoh or drugs or anything unusual.  Smoking prevents that assessment. So, the officer had every reason to ask her to stop smoking.  Her tone, not his is the surprise. And, now it seem she did have substantial cannabis in her system and very probably should not been driving. Her language is even more bizarre: she is out of control and she escalates the situation. There was a  black female officer on the scene in short order. What will she say?  But, then things change.  Ms Bland did admit to a recent suicide attempt. That question on the jail form is there for a reason: so detainees will be watched and measures taken to avoid a suicide. But, Ms Bland was left with the means to do so, a plastic garbage bag.  This is the tragedy and that is where the focus of the inquiry should be.

Hyperbole?  Let's reiterate the facts:  Sandra Bland refuses to put out her cigarette, the officer tells her "Get out of the car", then he starts pulling her out, then takes his taser out, threatens, "I will light you up", drags her out of the car, slams her to the ground, we can hear her tell him, "I have epilepsy" and he shouts, "GOOD!"<br/><br/>The officer claims she assaulted him - AFTER all that!  That is ultimately what he says he arrested her for - resisting arrest and assaulting an officer.  He told her she was under arrest BEFORE any of the tussle I described above ever took place.  Yet, we are supposed to believe that he was the one assaulted, even though we never see that take place.  Who is using hyperbole here?

Why not? Because we want women to complete in sport at the highest levels. And let's be frank, there are virtually no physical sports where women are competitive. You can look at lots of sports, women are about 90% of world record performance. And of course the only people on the field (probably even the qualifiers!) in a national or international competition are much closer than that. Sure, a top female athlete would beat me (an untrained man) at lots of things, but even then in a few categories like grip strength, even untrained men will overpower a trained female athlete.<br/><br/>Testosterone is a tremendous advantage. Men build muscle mass by accident, women really have to work at it. It's not sexist, it's biology and it can't be wished away.

Plus the rest of the country, for the economic activity generated by all that travel. Our economy is nationalized and we all have each other's back.<br/><br/>And as an added bonus, all Americans get to say "Yeah, I built that!".

Given that this is one person's experience weaning off of psychiatric drugs, why does the New York Times publish it?  We're not talking about hair conditioner here.  We're talking about serious medications.  New York Times, leave this for the blogosphere!

@Tenney Naumer,<br/><br/>"the near shut down of the thermohaline circulation in the north Atlantic"<br/><br/>Hunh?!? Maybe you should consult a physical oceanographer instead of a climate scientist. The global thermohaline circulation is driven by the wind. To shut it down, you'd have to stop the rotation of the earth, or turn off the wind. If it was shut down in the North Atlantic, or nearly shut down as you claim, it would be affecting the rest of the thermohaline circulation throughout the world, and that is not happening.

How is Newark any more of a direct connection to Manhattan than JFK? To get from Newark to Manhattan you take the AirTrain to NJ Transit to Penn Station. To get from JFK to Manhattan you take the AirTrain to LIRR to Penn Station. It's the EXACT same thing!! The truth is, from all 3 airports we need a ONE-seat ride - directly from the the airport to either Penn or Grand Central. We don't have that from any airport.

Well, guess what I was doing while reading this article?!<br/>My parents and the whole clan tried to make me quit when I was a toddler. Tried all the tricks, dipped my thumb in neem paste! They made fun of me, threatened me about revealing my habit to my friends. Nothing worked, I was stubborn.<br/>It's a lullaby to help me sleep, a warmth that consoled me better than burying your face in somebody's hug, even curling up in your mother's lap. A comfort no security blanket could give me. So, I won. I got to keep my habit. It's mostly when I am alone that I do it. Occasionally, there were a few laughs in our family and close friends, and I learned to laugh it off too!<br/>But, I've always kept it a secret with my friends. Even today, at 32 and being a fully functional mom, it still comforts me.<br/>Oh, and I have perfect teeth! And my thumb is safe too!<br/> Every time my dentist compliments my teeth, I chuckle.

Why is it hard?  Parental anxiety.  We are the least confident generation of parents ever!  <br/><br/>I do think the woman featured in the story, whose conservative Christian parents were staying alive "to hand her off to her husband" certainly were MAJOR contributors to her problems.

tb, I absolutely get that; but what if the other side to that is a suicidal child? There was a recent article over the winter (I think) about an Ivy grad who ended up at Goldman Sachs in SF - dream job, all that hard work paying off? He jumped off a building because of the pressure of the job.<br/><br/>But you're right, of course, in listing how much pressure there is out there...I just wonder if there's a way to lessen the impact of a 'stumble' and have the kids learn resiliency. There's no way to protect them (or us!) from life experiences of that nature. Isn't it better to learn how to manage through that?

Four game suspension?  For cheating?  Some example he sets for our young people!  He is no better than the drug users in pro sports and all the other shady performers to whom the fans pay big, big bucks.  He should have been suspended for life.  Shame on him!  Shame on the fans!  Shame on us as a society!

Tom Yarsley - "How and where will we store the required "excess" solar-generated electricity, for use when the sun is not shining?"<br/><br/>Simple, there will be no electrical usage allowed after dark. Problem solved! In the meantime shut down coal fired generators, stop using any type of fossil fuel and hope mother earth forgives us. A fantastic plan for the immediate future.

 But, but I thought Donald was no threat, I was assured he's nothing but a sideshow, so what's up with all the hit pieces? First the Daily Beast article about 30 year old discredited allegations and now this! I am sensing fear.

Guess what? I don't care about Trump's past and all the more better his verbal quips and legal war stories are funneling out for the public to view. Look at the polls lately? The public is deciding the same- they don't care either.   <br/><br/>Trump is not a career politician masking a shady past or hiding in fear that maybe something will jump out of the closet and haunt him one day. People who call him out, are going to called back and I LOVE IT!<br/><br/>I don't care what he stands for, I don't care about his position on social or economic issues- I support the upheaval and dismantling of a dysfunctional, hypocritical 2 party system which needs to be sent a resounding message that they have had the last 80 years to do something and failed miserably. <br/><br/>To All Career Politicians [On Behalf of Trump]: YOU'RE FIRED!

George are you for real ? first off , go watch the movie leatherheads about the early NFL and tell me about fair play in the early days!  Secondly i am pretty certain its the fact that they've been stealing signs in baseball for 100 years that our national conscience allows us to think its ok to invade other countries... and lastly , take a look at the last two drives in the super bowl , which more probable than not, the balls were between 12.5 and 13.5  psi's,  and tell me brady isn't a good qb. I think i'm going to Katmandu ! 

251563
so brady is classless because he just doesn't accept his punishment ? I guess you know for certain brady was involved? oh he wouldn't have destroyed his phone if he was innocent? he could have just as easily said he lost it, or the dog ate it or a number of other things. I think the man has every right to have his day in court. Philip Rivers puts pine tar on a football and its a 20 k fine and not another word about it, tom brady lets a psi out of the ball and its a 1 , a 4  a million bucks ( 2 mill more in salary ) a 4 game suspension and a hit on the reputation, ya I would take the nfl to court and make them prove it too.  Going for One for the thumb baby !!!!

You're talking about an official call on the field from 1982?  And the Tuck Rule - another official call on the field from 14 years ago?  I haven't been watching football for 50 years, but I've been watching long enough to know that every team, every season has bad calls and good calls that go their way.  No one notices or complains when the calls go against the Patriots.  They get as many as every other team in the league, but you don't hear them complaining about it more than 30 years later!<br/><br/>The phone issue is one in an Employer/Employee relationship with a contract that does not require Brady to turn over his phone to be considered cooperating.  And no one in the league has turned over their phone in an investigation, that is why in his statement, Tom said he was not about to make it a precedent in the union.

Hi Publius, are you white or non-white?<br/>I ask because when policemen stop a non-white person, they are not very polite or respectful. They like to have fun with the suspect and order him or her around.  Take the case in Texas where the cop tailgated the driver to pull her over for not signaling on a country back road, or the case where another officer stopped a driver for a broken 3rd brake light in a shopping mall parking lot. One victim was executed by the policeman by the policeman who then proceeded to alter the evidence and accounts of what happened. Other officers  corroborated these fabrications and only the dash/body camera or a bystander's camera revealed these lies for what they were. That poor 12 year old kid in Cleveland has all of 2 seconds of life left when the police showed up.<br/><br/>It's time to recognize we have a significant problem nationwide with the police's attitude towards brown or black skinned citizens. For some reason, police do not expect all Japanese origin or Chinese origin citizens to attack them using  Judo or Kung Fu!<br/>For the brown and black population, policeman approach them with their guns on ready, have no manners, insist on demeaning people and ordering them arbitrarily  instead of asking politely, and definitely lack the training and composure to control the situation respectfully while being firm. 

251895
What kind of person? A cold-blooded murderer. <br/><br/>I'm glad the prosecutor was decisive. I hope he will be unwavering in his resolve to see to it that justice is done and that monster never gets out. <br/><br/>I hope the city swiftly ensures the children who are now fatherless are cared for. <br/><br/>Rest in peace, Sam Dubose!

251952
@Robert Dana: why do university policeman carry firearms? Because that is what the NRA wants. The NRA assumes every cop is good. And when they aren't, then their mantra "the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun". When are we going to de-escalate with less guns. Didn't the Wild West finalize realize that in order to live peacefully, we needed to stop carrying firearms? Didn't we learn in the 1930s that we needed to outlaw machine guns? The NRA wants all citizens to carry semi-automatic and automatic weapons; the equivalent of Al Capone walking around with a machine gun. Outlaw weapons of mass destruction. Let's get some common sense in America. If you're Congressional representative approves of the NRA, vote them out of office!

251955
I know this may be an asinine opinion, but whatever happened to following a police officers simple request?   This is a tragedy, but Mr Dubose was drinking, had no license, and missing his front plate. Then he attempts to flee the officer.  All illegal!  If he had simply cooperated with the officer, no issue.  Seems pretty clear.   

252197
The three teams in their division are much improved??  I wouldn't gamble yourself.  Not many teams do well with new coaches ( or Ryan Tannehill at quarterback ).  Outside of the Patriots, the AFC East still sucks - bet on that!

Getting a door slammed on him? Did we watch the same video? I just replayed the door part three times and the door is never slammed. It is barely clicked closed. <br/><br/>So how about we put every American through training and tell them to comply with orders, and then at the same time, put the police through some training on how to not shoot someone because he didn't get out of his car. Why is that okay? Cripes! There's gotta be a better Plan B.

252488
@Juvenal<br/>“thought the cop was pretty patient??”  One minute? 60 seconds?<br/><br/>Here are EIGHT incidents where ARMED white suspects who pointed loaded guns at officers were talked down WITHOUT being shot much less killed!<br/><br/>One incident the police talked for almost an HOUR to calm a guy down with a loaded gun!  All white!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/8-white-people-who-pointed-guns-police-officers-and-managed-not-get-killed" title="http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/8-white-people-who-pointed-guns-police-officers-and-managed-not-get-killed" target="_blank">http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/8-white-people-who-pointed-guns-...</a>

252576
Do you think cops are more honest or truthful than the people they police ?  In contrary, because of the lawful brazen vulgarity that assumes that cops tell the truth unless proven otherwise, the cops have all kinds of pre-arranged stories , anytime they kill a civilian wrongfully. These armed to he teeth and trained officers get away with such brazen , asinine vulgarities like 'I feared for my life', when even dealing with unarmed women !<br/>The courts, the law protects the killer cops , only a few , very few get prosecuted.

252622
Why would any cop fear when the cop is the one with the gun? the bullets? the taser? And in so many of these cases, they have the law ("resisting arrest!!!) and the grand jury on their side. I guess shooting a young man for not having a license plate in the correct place is considered following procedure. A man is dead and you call it cooked up hysteria. Wow.

252662
How do you think doctors are trained and advances in medicine come about?  Using coloring books?  Cadaver parts have been harvested for the purpose of advancing science for centuries now.  Unappetizing?  Perhaps, but if you have a better way, by all means let's hear it!

252772
"What does that say about us?"<br/>1. That PT Barnum is still right<br/>2. And as Abe Lincoln famously said " You can fool all of the people some of the time and fool some of the people all of the time ..." And that should be sufficient!

Donald is not afraid of lobbies' view points, and he is not in anyone's pocket, hear that Koch Brothers? For once we have a truly independent straight shooter running with one goal: To Make America  Great Again! He will create jobs, fix decaying infrastructures, provide respectable jobs for the returning vets, and HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE GOOD DEALS. Bravo Mr. Trump. America needs you

In the South we have a joke: "What is the difference between a New Yorker and a Southerner? The Southerner will make you think he is not going to screw you; the New Yorker will tell you ahead of time he is going to screw you!" I like the straight talk of Trump. Tell it to me like you see it. Don't skirt around the bush. Come at me head on. That way I know what I'm dealing with. People like Trump are far safer than people like the Clintons. I like Hillary, but can't trust her. I can trust Trump to always be Trump, and that is a huge plus for me and, apparently, a lot of other people.

"In order for us to have a true free market we need to rid ourselves of the Federal Reserve and allow people to decide market prices"?<br/><br/>Following this kind of Rand laissez faire economic philosophy will mean an unmitigated disaster. <br/><br/>Piketty in his seminal book Capitol of 21st century has convincingly argued that the rate of return on capital in capitalist economies tends to be higher than the growth rate, leading to a concentration of wealth and growing inequality.<br/><br/>Oxfam said at Davos  that the 85 richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest 50% (3.5 billion people). The charity said this year that the comparison was now even more stark, with just 80 people owning the same amount of wealth as more than 3.5 billion people, down from 388 in 2010.  Rampant crony capitalism has ensured this filthy inequality.  <br/><br/>Paradoxically  for  Americans to live the American dream, should go to Denmark. where socialistic  policy in areas like health care, child care, education and protecting the unemployed are part of a “solidarity system” that makes sure that almost no one falls into economic despair!

It sounds like the parable of the vineyard: "Did I not agree with thee for a penny?"  Longtime employees are complaining about getting a raise because workers who have not labored as long in the vineyard are getting one too.  It's obviously not true that no good deed goes unpunished, but apparently some do not.  Kudos to Dan Price!  A day's work for a day's pay AND a day's pay for a day's work should be our standard.

and you think FIFA is corrupt?  In the near future the only countries that can afford to host an Olympics will be dictatorships who answer to no one. I was listening to a report yesterday about the pollution in the water at Rio and how it is unsafe to be in. Nice job!

"Who got us into this mess in the first place?" It sure was not President Obama ! I pray that we would just leave it alone in the entire Middle East and stay home and let them have at it. The United States could never bring peace to bear over there - never ! It is not our calamity. Our military expenditure is the largest line item in the US budget and I hear constant rumblings that we could reduce that item substantially if Congress would just eliminate the redundancy in our military investment rather than to continue to play politics !!

254634
"Officials are trying to understand why the Nusra Front had turned on the trainees" ??!! A group allied with Al Qaeda attacks our mercenaries and officials are "surprised"<br/><br/>This is just another evidence of how clueless are those directing our policy in Syria and the ME in general. We have  learned nothing from the Iraq debacle. Some heads should roll at the Pentagon and CIA! ( I mean this, of course, figuratively)

254731
Infuriating?  If you're so tender, don't read Ms. Gay. She didn't rank anything - just pointed out the truth - no one weeps on TV for innocent humans killed by police. You think an OPINION column puts demands on your emotions?  You think the author is trying to control your emotions?  You are free to "feel" any emotion you want.  But being infuriated is really misplaced here. Ms. Gay never expressed lack of empathy for Cecil.  She expressed lots of empathy for Cecil.  And empathy for other beings (human by the way)tragically killed in our society recently. No comparisons - no reason to have a stroke - ain't worth it!

If this is such a great agreement , why have only 600 corporate lobbyists been permitted to work on it? Why is it so secret? What are thery afraid of? Why are our elected representatives forbidden to see and talk about it?<br/><br/>SOPA [the Stop Online Piracy Act] and PIPA [ the Protect Intellectual Property Act] were both unanimously defeated in our Congress in January, 2012 when our mostly young technocrats rose up to say: " NO - this stinks!"  Now these same intrusive laws which will interfere with intellectual freedom have been stuck into this facist piece of legislation.<br/>Thanks to whistleblowers, we know that this agreement has nothing to do with  free trade and more to do with circumventing labor, environmental and financial regulations that exist to protect citizens.<br/>In Mexico we see how laborers are treated as chattel. Since the passage of the North Atlantic Trade Agreement NAFTA, millions have fled north to the US after US corn poured into Mexico - destroying the small farmers' ability to survive. Inequality has soared in Mexico. An immigration crisis exists in the US because of NAFTA.<br/> The Trans Pacific Partnership is NAFTA on Steroids.<br/>The tribunals set up by this agreement will only bring money to the lawyers and misery to the small countries and its citizens unable to stand up to the Greed of Corporate Vulture Capitalism.

This is a joke article right?<br/>1.  The killing of the animal was pre-meditated murder.<br/>2. The animal could never have done anything at all to question its intent or actions.  It is a apex predator.<br/>3. As far as I know the animal does not have any laws to follow except the laws of nature.  Therefore, there is no question here, it did not break the law!<br/>4. The animal is 1 of 23 or 24k left on earth that have no say in what "man" does.<br/>5. The cases of police violence against anyone are minuscule compared to the overall interactions they have with the public every year.  Yes there are BAD cops out there just like there are bad people in the world and in every other job.  These cases must be dealt with one at a time and as separate entities.  It is not a case of "there is a bad cop, therefore all cops are bad."  It just does not work that way.<br/><br/>Finally, I do believe you are right (and this is not a joke), you should wear a lion costume and walk around in public.  Or maybe a clown costume would be better....either way it is perfect for you as you are truly a joke for trying to compare these two subjects.

255127
By charginge for clinical trials  does the researche relly get a  random sample pf affected patients?  Of course not!  If one can affors $30 K then the rest of your life was probably pretty good.  Adequate nutrition, prior health care, education for goodness sake.<br/><br/>This is simply more greed in our money infested world.

What makes writers of news articles believe that Rush Limbaugh's noise matters?  Are they in such dire need of quotes that they report on what failed disk jockeys say in order to find out what people who don't run businesses think of running businesses?  Why don't they just ask real business people to talk about business?<br/><br/>You could ask me what I think of plastic surgery, but being neither a provider nor a consumer of that commodity, you'd get a meaningless answer.  "I'm against it!  Well, except for burn victims,and people who have been scarred in accidents, and the truly unhappy and... oh, never mind.<br/><br/>And by the way, if what Mr. Price did is socialism, sign me up.  But it isn't of course... Oh never mind.

How can one allege that humans are majestic?  Humans are generally rather pathetic and disgusting, ignorant, lazy, selfish and short-sighted.  Human societies are based on exploitation, oppression and injustice.  Human males have created a world of perpetual warfare ruled by violence; his industrial civilization is frying the planet and causing the Sixth Great Extinction.  Women and children are nowhere safe from rape, sexual assault and male violence.  Racism and xenophobia are rampant.  The majority of humans adhere to violent patriarchal religions that made sense to illiterate goat herders thousands of years ago; many think a woman caused humanity's downfall by listening to a talking snake.  Majestic?  Give me a break. <br/><br/>Lions and wild animals generally are pure and graceful and do not kill for sport.  As Hunter Thompson wrote: "I have always loved animals.  They are different from us . . . their hearts are pure and there is usually no fat on their bodies and they will never call the police on you or take you in front of a judge or run off and hide with your money."<br/><br/>There is no basis to assume that being outraged by the murder of a lion is mutually exclusive to being outraged at the murder of black citizens by racist and brutal police. <br/><br/>Indeed, let us stop the violence --- against animal kind, against wildlife, against the earth, against people of color, against women and children. <br/><br/>Justice for Cecil! Justice for Sam!  Justice for Sandra and Eric and Mike. Justice!

I have RBF, and being told to smile by strangers/being asked "are you ok?" by friends and acquaintances is the most annoying thing in the world. I've adopted a stock response to the latter, which is: "I'm fine, this is just how my face is." The person usually looks slightly taken aback or amused, depending on their sense of humor, and the interaction ends. For the "Smile!" thing, I find headphones is an effective defense.

255453
The title is a question?  "Should we charge patients for medical research?" The answer must be "yes" when you realize that we are all inevitably patients!  Medical research should be funded through civilizing practice of taxation.<br/><br/>The author does include the somewhat remarkable admission that families will spend every penny that they have in an attempt to save their children.  This is the inelastic demand that is the bedrock of the health care industry and the bane of moral theologians.  This is also the rational acting of the individual that creates the so-called "invisible hand" of capitalism.  And this is the very reason that all health care and medical research should be funded by our collective society.  The alternatives are brutish and barbaric.  

255684
"Who has the energy to smile to strangers all day, anyway?"<br/><br/>Pretty much anyone in service industries does just that, and with good reason, as the article suggests.  Smiles make social interactions easier and better.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the sexism angle, this would not be controversial.  The article suggests that men are spared the RBF issue.  But men in service positions are indeed better off being -- and appearing -- more pleasant, approachable, and, well, happy.  Perhaps the gender issue there is that many men don't realize they're in service industries!  If they did, I think more of our daily interactions would be nicer.<br/><br/>By the way, botulinum toxin works very well for undesirably downturned mouth corners.  For persons whose job performance suffers from RBF, it's a simple enough treatment, but needs to be repeated ever 4 months or so (less often than getting your hair styled).  Whether that's worth it for non-work related situations, I'll leave it to others to comment….

255754
Leave?  We need to keep the military industrial complex humming!  And of course make sure we have tax cuts for corporations (who are people BTW) and the wealthy.  Where would we spend the trillions?  Roads, bridges, affordable housing, a new TRANS-HUDSON TUNNEL?

How many Nassau county girls of the 70's woke up one morning in high school suddenly wanting to be a farmer?  Family, teachers, guidance counselors all were horrified.  Not a suitable career choice at all!  Now, after 30 years of farming and other agricultural businesses, I know the choice fit - but my point is, I had absolutely no idea back then what being a farmer really meant, or would mean for me.  No 17 year old does.  What is important is to build a reasonable and solid foundation of experience, opportunity, and network - get a variety of experiences, don't narrow yourself too soon, keep the blinders of opportunity off, meet useful people, and don't waste the opportunities that come along.  A career is like a tree, each branch building on the previous one.  The thicker and more solid the trunk, the more productive the tree.  Build that foundation wisely and with intention, college may be part of it but not always, always knowing that the unexpected is likely to be more pivotal than the expected.  

256033
This topic always deteriorates to the, "Why them and not me?" syndrome. As does any other public policy which requires money and/or God forbid help people.  Rise above people- Rise above!

In a way this current trend among celebs and others in the public eye, the public domain with themselves and on such a constant basis, day after day basis - it makes you wonder, wouldn't be be better to just flash a smile, even every once and again instead of looking depressed, sad, defiant, absent and less less than the radiant "star" that you?  Same goes for the guys, they have too much of a hard edge as if they too are afraid of a smile.  Forget the encroaching wrinkles, you're a human being!  Few women not matter what age can be without a smile and radiate great beauty like Sophia Loren or Naomi Campbell etc., so why present a blank expression?  If this is fashion it is a sad one.  Started by the singer turned fashion designer whose name slips my mind now and then followed by another model who is going to Hollywood (like the other Hollywood gal who wanted to be alone?), it's silly.  An actress has to show more than a blank stare, will we know you are really one of us humans at that time lovely gal?  Hollywood for you? Actresses have to emote and it will involve lines, but nothing to fear.  There is a face cream for every wrinkle so these young gals who refuse to smile and show they are happy or for whatever reason the stone face, live more worry less.  Botox and other solutions will be there for use once you use your facial muscles a few times.  Seriously, life is not long enough to be on the other side (or appear to be there already) before you're even thirty or forty.  

256222
Why did the NY Times make your silly comments their pick?  Really?  Why not tell the joke that you should wear a lion costume so people will feel sorry if you get shot?!?  It's a darn good question to ask why people are so upset about the death of a lion, but not the deaths of people.  It's stupid to claim that one can do both.  Of course you can do both, but when there is world wide outrage for a lion, but the deaths of people everyday gets barely a blip...or worse, people try to justify the deaths...something is wrong with some sectors of society.<br/><br/> All lives matter is not supported by the evidence.  The evidence is that some lives matter more than others.  "Black lives matter" is therefore a good slogan because it tells a truth that "ought" to be.  A truth that many on the right don't want to hear and don't actually believe.  <br/><br/>Wearing a lion costume...or wearing "white face" makeup so you will be treated better is no joke.  But any way you slice it, wearing a lion costume does not imply that lions don't matter, but rather, the life of the person wearing the costume should matter at least as much.  The Time editors should be ashamed of themselves for highlighting someone who says otherwise.

Could it be that suddenly there is a God to rescue us from this whole rotten deal? We certainly couldn't depend on Obama or Congress or our entire political system to do the right thing, but Australia, Chile, and New Zealand--?! Wonders never cease.

What do you mean 'Frequent instances of driving while impaired"? No where does any report say that he was impaired. The bottle was full and closed. You can see that for yourself.  What if the cops bullet had accidentally hit someone else? <br/><br/>As for Ms Band's family, it is not as easy as you may think to come up with $500 on a $5,000 bail.  <br/><br/>Stop blaming the victim. Nothing will ever change until all of us start holding police accountable. Come on. This was a traffic stop!

Not so - how many times have I walked down the street, lost in thought, and been told to smile by a passing male stranger? Or something similar: "What's wrong sweetie?" "Smile, beautiful!" "Whatever it is, isn't so bad."  I would bet most women have had the same experience. It doesn't bother me that much - it's obviously well intentioned - but don't pretend that men don't get bothered by a seemingly unfriendly female face!

You know what is hilarious? that you think that Democrats are not megabucks wealthy and don't have offshore accounts too!<br/><br/>Also: people always tell themselves that they are working frantically and making money for some glorious retirement. By that time, your kids are grown and busy too, and your grandkids hardly know you. (Cue: Harry Chapin's Cat in the Cradle). Your spouse has long since found other things to fill their time besides YOU, or you are long divorced. Beside which, after 40 years of working 90 hours a week, you are a physical wreck and in poor health. So your "golden years", for which you worked so hard, are now spent in a "upscale" Assisted Living center. Whoopee, those extra millions gets you a few more chandeliers in the lobby.

I only encountered the "Are you OK?" questions in the last several years, mostly at work but also from my 30-yr. old son.  Finally figured it out. Age!  Facial tissue sags with aging and pulls down the corners of my mouth to create a frown that can be interpreted however the viewer projects: Sadness, arrogance, anger, bitterness, worry, physical pain, mental anguish, etc. I think it had a lot to do with trouble I had two co-workers who felt threatened by my higher education and interpreted my resting or thinking face as snobbery and a "superiority complex." They reacted by undermining my work at every opportunity, turning our boss against me and other bully tactics. My smiles never overcame that perception and I wish I had understood the "senior resting face" phenomenon sooner. It would have saved me a lot of grief.

$4,000 per month for a room?! This looks like it would have been a fun place to live when I was younger but it's incredibly expensive, even at the low-end, for a room. No wonder millennials are living with their parents.

You know what? This is what an expression-neutral face looks like, female or male. When someone plasters an ever-present smile on their face, they look FAKE, not pretty, or whatever else it is they're supposed to look.<br/><br/>And any man who tells a woman with a neutral look on her face to "smile" is, frankly, an idiot.<br/><br/>But what is nearly as distressing is that the female author of this piece, and every woman quoted therein seem to buy into this silliness, fully - oppressing themselves, as well! What sense does that make? I know it's not meant to be taken so seriously, but, come on.

"What interested you most in The Times this week?" I think this article had to be it. I think that everyone should know what their goals are for their future, it helps you be productive and successful. A lot of the examples they used in this article are very good life lessons, and will most likely help you think deeply about the topic of the story and think about what you want to do in your lifetime. All colleges should have an optional class like this, not just colleges, high school, and maybe even elementary too! It is important to know what you want to be in the future so that in your younger years you can build a foundation of information on that subject, or even be completely engaged and start learning and experiencing the roots of your topic.

Since 80% of all flights taken are unnecessary,  why is this news?<br/><br/>"Look honey, we can fly San Diego to Baltimore for $258 round trip"<br/><br/>"But honey, we don't know anyone in Baltimore."<br/>" Who cares?  Let's go!!"<br/><br/>For business travel the percentage is probably closer to 90%.

I know what some people might think or say, "Don't you think you're too old to even be reading this article?"  You would be a hundred percent right, except I could not help myself.  Jon Caramanica, I almost don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate your literary style, your panache, and all the details and blow by blow descriptions, all of which must have taken some time for you to get down right and publish the way you have. I am older, yes, I am.  But, I am grateful that you have exist and existing is one thing, writing and writing the way you do is something else.  Isn't it?  Thank you, I never would have known of Tesfaye had it not been for you, and in a way, I want to know what's happening.  I haven't finished reading your analysis report yet, but I had to let you know, wherever you come from, I am grateful for you.  What a great and exciting young writer you are!

When I was a kid, I often said to my mom, "Mom, why are you mad?" She didn't realize she had her RBF on. <br/><br/>Although I wish my parents had coached me to smile more and—above all—make eye contact, I don't find myself prone to trust people who smile all the time. <br/><br/>Taking random selfies recently, I've noticed I frown quite a lot. However, I've seen in other people that random grinning—particularly in a staff meeting!—can make them seem demented. There are no easy answers; I think we have to adjust the expectations of the viewer as much as the presentation of the viewee.

When the Democratic Party brain trust starts asking "Is there anybody else?" come the turn of the coming New Year, there had better be somebody else who could actually win the General in November 2016. At this moment, with all due respect to Bernie Sanders (and much is due), there is nobody else, unless the GOP puts up a blithering maniac as its nominee.<br/><br/>But wait a minute...! Maybe Bernie's odds aren't so bad after all. Still, "Run Joe. Run!"<br/><br/><a href="http://www.endthemadnessnow.org" title="www.endthemadnessnow.org" target="_blank">www.endthemadnessnow.org</a>

Christian sympathy for our Dem presidents?<br/><br/>This is the confusion---the Dem presidents are getting more excuses and sympathy because they are so relentlessly attacked and besieged by the Repubs on anything possible.  Thus our demands and expectations are reduced. Pretty nifty.<br/><br/>This is how the whole center of our politics has moved relentlessly rightward over decades. Now what were once centrist in bygone generations are seen as so left wing, that our liberals won’t even  push them in the current climate. Like high marginal taxes, no offshore corporate tax havens, accepting union bargaining, affordable college tuition, breaking up big banks, and prosecuting financial crime.  Oh, and strict limits on private money in elections. We once had all these!<br/><br/>Now our presidents can’t advocate for these and neither can our eminent liberals like Prof Krugman.<br/>These basics of democracy that were once centrist here, and are centrist now in many advanced countries, are here off the table.  <br/><br/>Here’s  a question---If Bill. Clinton had simply refused to sign repeal of Glass Steagall, what would have happened?<br/>And same for prison expansion and Nafta. Suppose he had fought against these? Even if he failed, he would have sent a message that the country could build on. Now we try to salvage our 2nd rate democracy.

Why do we still have to hear this stuff?  What a nauseating article, but in a very familiar pattern. You start by telling us that it's the trend to call any woman with a serious expression a bitch and then ending up with the faintly jokey suggestion that, "Wow, isn't odd that this only happens to women?"  This gets really tired, but it never stops!

258938
Really?!?  Joe Biden grew up in a family that had lost everything in the Depression, but it didn't make him bitter.  He is personally modest, decent and good hearted and of sound judgement and compassion.  The Donald isn't worthy of shining Joe Biden's shoes.

259246
Really? Starting a business always makes the world a better place? I always thought that was what the tooth fairy was for. I have started a business and it is damned hard work,,,how ever I deal honestly with my customers so I think that is enough to make the world a better place!

jearboleda did you forget the simple fact which can be verified that the very Oligarchs you speak of men like Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerburg, Bill Gates, George Sorros, Harvey Weinstein, Larry Ellison, Steven Speilberg and many more bought and paid for President Obama? <br/><br/>Did you also forget theses men and others who supported the president represent the fortune 100 elite companies of the world like Goldman Saches, Google, Oracle, Microsoft, and General Electric while others are media icons who have extreme influence over the content which gets produced and what movies get funding to be made?<br/><br/>President Obama is the president of the oligarchs and by the oligarchs!<br/><br/>How else do you think an unknown man with no notable accomplishments save for being a Harvard Graduate and Chicago street agitator. Went from nothing to Nobel prize winner and POTUS in under a decade? Prior to him announcing his candidacy no average person in America even knew his name. Yet in less than a year after announcing he was more popular than Hillary Rodam Clinton the pre ordained first woman president former First Lady, NY Senator and wife of a living and very popular only two term Democrat president since FDR to back down from the Democratic presidential bid. <br/><br/>This just does not happen in the United States Of Entertainment without the blessings of the oligarchs particularly those in media.

Is Fox news the only REP outlet?.How about WSJ,Mark Levin ,Financial Times ,Briebert to name a few. What about the 98% of so called   partial stations who should before reporting  as the NY Times say that they are a lobbyist for BHO. Under his administration the USA is weaker,less allies ,18TRILLION dollar deficit which is 6 T more than Bush,smaller military .worst economic recovery, a Immigration system that is being done by this Pres thru Exec Order. The biased editorial  didn't mention that instead of going to Congress  first the Iran deal which should have been a treaty was approved by the UN. We all know how impartial they are. What a country!

259591
Let's try reversing that: Sarah Palin, as the "Joe Biden" of the GOP? Somehow, that doesn't have much of a ring to it. <br/><br/>Joe may be a bit goofy, but he's not scary. I don't think Joe has anything to worry about.<br/><br/>OTOH, I've been recommending Bristol as a running-mate for Donald Trumpp! ;-)

259650
Are you kidding me? Fortunately I wasn't born and raised there but I currently live in Delaware. Biden is an absolute joke! His intelligence is not questioned? I don't believe how the people of Delaware have promoted him to some sort of icon politician. Integrity? Personal decency? Give me a break! Even though I would love for him to be the Democrat candidate.

259717
The Republicans have put forth "20 viable candidates"?!<br/><br/>I live in New Jersey.  Soon-to-be-indicted Christie is NOT a viable candidate.

259829
Who is the successor to Obama?  Up to now, it has been Hillary who was his Secretary of State. But if Biden jumps in, he can legitimately claim that title.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, unless Obama suddenly changes direction, he has managed to  frustrate and disappoint progressive Democrats. He is allowing drilling in the Arctic, handed the health care system over to the for profit health insurance industry, did the biding of the pharmaceutical industry by strongly advocating for the TPP, etc.  <br/><br/>Hillary and Biden are pretty similar to Obama and would have us believe that the status quo is sufficient.  They likely will split the Obama forces.  If Biden gets in, the big winner is Sanders.<br/><br/>Run Joe Run!

259919
Not getting support for your 2016 presidential run? Well just use your dead veteran son for the sympathy vote! Low. Classless. Disgraceful. Shame on you Joe Biden.

What is it about Hillary that makes Ms Dowd lose her mind and any sense of perspective? She promoted the candidacy of Obama over Clinton like few in the media last time. Now it’s Biden over Clinton? Because Beau would want it? Seriously? <br/><br/>How about some fair coverage of Clinton and the issues, substantive and otherwise? For example, Dowd if she’s so concerned about Clinton’s personal email server, she might mention that Jeb Bush had hundreds of thousands of messages on a personal machine while Gov, and that he erased all of them. Oops!

260408
Did no one else watch Joe Biden chair the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings back in 1991?  Anita herself blamed him (Huffington Post-2014)for doing a terrible job-never calling 3 other women with complaints, not calling experts, etc.  From my point of view he could barely stop talking himself and bears huge responsibility for putting Clarence Thomas on the Court!  He wasn't a kid at the time-when he gets center stage, which he has not had for the last 7 years, watch out!  I hate to think what he could say or how he mess things up on a worldwide stage, nice man though he might be.

Flying? I did it recently on American.  I am freshly reminded that I #!!@$!@$# hate it.  Negotiating an airline trip is like dealing with thieving midway carnies. It is an unhonorable and revolting business.

How many of you would be willing to take a bullet in the head because you were waiting to determine if the uncooperative, hostile person you were confronting might not be reaching for a gun?<br/><br/>It is all too easy for these posters, who would not do police work, to condemn those who want to go home to their families after their shift.<br/><br/>And these posters quickly would call the police to protect them if they were threatened. <br/><br/>Hypocrisy lives large here!

261034
With so many candidates, each looking for a stage on which to speak, why not hold multiple debates with 4 or 5 candidates apiece?  Draw for groupings, run the debates, have impartial (non-Fox) judges (like maybe a few university or even high school debate coaches) determine a winner, then have those 3 or 4 winners debate.  The public could possibly get a lot more information from that type of format than the 8-10 minute sound bites each one is going to offer up on Thursday.  And it might actually be a real debate!

261473
You mean that big corporations would even think of taking advantage of their customers? I'm shocked - shocked I tell you!<br/>Oil prices are in the upper $40s. How are the ticket prices treating you? Don't you love the bag fees, the extra charges for aisle and window seats, the total lack of any food, etc. etc.?<br/>Oh, and they go bankrupt, then rip off their employees while the big boys laugh all the way to the bank.<br/>Heads they win - tails we lose.

261695
Richard, are you seriously making the argument that Obama is only advocating this deal to gin up his place in the history books?  This deal is most certainly on a par with Nixon-China or Reagan-USSR.  Not only do the other 4 signatories to the deal prove it--including Putin's Russia, who otherwise never do us any favors--but so does the fact that the deals origins precede Obama's presidency!<br/><br/>Finally, if a deal on preventing a hostile theocracy from obtaining nuclear weapons, even for 15 years, isn't 'bringing the world to a higher plane of stability', I don't know what is.  A lot can happen in 15 years, including the delegitimization of either the regime's anti-western stance or its own lock on power.  Don't forget, Tiananmen Square happened within 15 years of Nixon's visit/deal.  To not endorse this deal is to eliminate 15 years of possibility (and hope) in favor of near-certain war.  <br/><br/>Are you endorsing war, Richard?  Because belittling this by-all-accounts comprehensive deal by saying Obama just wanted it off the table in order to focus on 'domestic entitlements' certainly sounds like you do.

261784
So, the logical extension of your proposition would be that the only way for cops to be safe would be to cruise roadways and highways, just randomly executing drivers, and claim crime prevention as their rationale?  Right ... Got it.  Well, we're almost there and experts like the good Dr. Lew is doing his very best to get us there.  Holy Moly, what a world!!

261936
This is simply more evidence -- as if we needed it? -- that the Republicans haven't had a single, new idea since 1947.<br/><br/>They've run through the other six so many times none of us even notice any more.  They're hoping to regain our attention by playing the tune, Kill Women Not Their Embryonic Cells, for the millionth time.<br/><br/>It's kind of like whistling the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- the "Ode to Joy," based on the poem by Friedrich Schiller -- it shows you can barely manage a simple melody, but it's certainly no evidence of any musical mastery.<br/><br/>Oh well; we have plenty of online junk on Youtube to entertain ourselves with, we don't need this, too.<br/><br/>See you all once Clinton's been elected, and have a nice year!  Shame about all those gazillions spent. Rihanna wins, no matter how much you spend, though.

262151
Are youths like China irresponsible when they have sex without a condom? Sure they are! They’re kids. What’s harder to understand is the irresponsibility of Republican House members.<br/>-------------------------<br/>According to venerable homosexual activist Larry Kramer, homosexuals have the same problem -- avoidance of condoms.  It shows in the syphilis rates, too, as CDC stats show, not just in HIV.  It's not just the GOP that "obsesses over sex," is it?

262439
What are you talking about? Didn't you read the story of China? The clinic is keeping her healthy now so she can have children later when she can afford them and take care of them. No one is denying poor people children, they are denying them poverty! Poor teenagers having children pretty much guarantees that both mother and child will remain impoverished.

262502
Did you really use Iran-Contra, which was both illegal and immoral, as an example of presidential negotiations? How the Times worm has turned! A better parallel is Bill Clinton's nuclear deal with North Korea. How has that worked out?

262585
Since candidates who run for office seem to be able to stoop to almost any indignity--like answering the question "Boxers or briefs?"--I think FOX should have used a different format to accommodate the Might Also Rise contenders at 1 percent or less.<br/><br/>A playoff!<br/><br/>With early rounds.  Sudden death if you don't rise X percent by the end of the night.  With a Sweet Sixteen and a Final Four.<br/><br/>It would have kept the nation glued for weeks and would have shown up our political process for what it has become.  A game show.  A reality TV show.  A cage fight for the cautious.  A spectacle with a for-blood crowd just waiting to go thumbs up or down.<br/><br/>So round one has become a "Don't Inflame The Donald" episode?  Good Lord.  Our literate, historically minded Founding Fathers are turning in their graves.

262621
Sanctions? You mean like the sanctions against Cuba, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, Somalia and...Iran? OK, they're working out so well, let's do more!

$38 for Viagra?  It used to be $10, didn't it?  I guess the market is bearing a lot these days.<br/><br/>Incidentally, such drugs do not work at all for many after a radical prostatectomy - pumps or implants are required in those cases.<br/><br/>To those who choose to "go gentle into that good night", do so by all means, but please don't cavil at those who choose to revel lustily to the end!

262971
Vice President Biden to run against Hilary Clinton because she has been damaged?  Neither the email issue or Benghazi have produced a smoking gun.  But, Republicans will drag out and repeat their investigations to keep them in the news.  If Biden runs they have countless gaffs to use plus more to come.  The big money in politics will find something negative to use against who ever runs. It is becoming harder for a quality candidate to run because political system destroys them. So we get more Donald Trumps!

263067
What has happened to rules regarding the admissibility of expert testimony? This guy has no peer-reviewed work that supports his theories, never having published in a scientific journal, and one analysis by an editor of one professional journal has concluded that his theories are deeply flawed. Moreover, courts are allowing him to testify not only about his purported area of expertise -- the timing involved in drawing and shooting a weapon -- but about the state of mind of the cop!! Wow!! Have these judges actually studied one of the basic principles of trial practice? Transcripts of Lewinsky's testimony should be used in law schools around the country in Evidence class to teach why self-appointed experts should never be allowed to testify in court as expert opinion witnesses.

263281
Why does every columnist in Washington say that Trump cannot be taken seriously, he will not be the Republican candidate?<br/><br/>Apparently, the columnists cannot believe the evidence of their eyes.<br/><br/>Trump is like a Rohrschach test applied to the  Republican electorate.  He tells us something very important about Republican voters.<br/><br/>Learn from Trump!  He is teaching us something very important about the electorate!<br/><br/>That doesn't mean others should adopt his positions.  But they should study this phenomenon carefully.<br/>The 'others' who need to study include Democrats, such as Hillary.<br/><br/>The Republican establishment is terrified of Trump, he's out of their control.  Columnists cannot believe it.  But this is wishful thinking. Those who refuse to face and examine this reality will be losers.

263399
"My question to them: Do you really want to increase the odds that kids like China will get pregnant, will spread disease, will become impoverished single mothers, will get mired in a cycle of poverty, will get abortions — or will die of breast or cervical cancer — and do you really think this is moral behavior to be proud of?"<br/><br/>Answer: Of course! The GOP feeds on Object Lessons that draw a bright red line around The Other. Without them, the party withers and dies. 

263424
Shouldn't someone be concerned with vile racist words and laws, rather than mere symbols? I have in mind the Alabama Constitution which still mandates separate schools for the races. The citizens have voted to maintain that clause twice in the last 10 years, the second time by a substantially increased margin. ISOLATE ALABAMA!

263454
CR ~ What do you mean:  "Through no fault of his own?"  Of course it was (is?) Obama's fault.  He needed to be far, far tougher early in his presidency.  I can't see where Joe B would be any better.  He does not exude toughness that I can see.  Give me Bernie!

263461
And Hillary is not a dinosaur? Goes to show the shallowness of your intent. You would vote for a woman just for gender even though she may have broken the laws, hid classified documents, worked outside the government as SOS, may have been more responsible for the deaths of the 4 men in Lybia, may have been running weapons - may have been trading favors for donations to the foundation - and we don't know because she hid the files and the proof. Seems like this is the woman to vote for right? If you want a woman in the WH ask Condoleezza Rice  to run - Oh she is a conservative - ooooops!

263494
Douthat,<br/><br/>When will you ever acknowledge the horror of what these Republican primary candidates actually are saying?  Do you really want to live in the world they'd want the chance to create?  Does anything matter to you except your obsession with the bedrooms of other people, and bringing people to their knees, in a Christian church of course.  Americans' lives-- all of them-- matter!  

263522
What is the chance that the winner could be "None Of The Above"?<br/><br/>Who will be first with THAT bumper sticker or mug?<br/><br/>That said, yeah, Scranton Joe, come on down and let the lying begin in earnest - go after Hillary Rodham and all of her duplicity.  What fun!!

263782
Has the bar sunk so low that the fact that Trump is unscripted and that his answers are "his" enough? Aren't any of these folks listening to what he is saying? Everything he says is wrong! Wrong answers! Wrong for the middle class, women, immgrants, etal. So his words are his own. His supporters are truly fools.

263985
And where the fabled aggregate demand would come from? Let alone increase in aggregate demand? And how in a (modern) world that aggregate demand would exceed the supply? It is only working in rental housing (and that is shameful for the country) - super inflexible thing . Increase in demand only can come from increase in workers pay, that they do not have work more to get. It is from any prospective - from easiness to spend, to looser budgeting earmarking. Increased profits do increase demand too, but for too few people to outdo the effect of the pay. Increased pay will hit inflexibilities - housing, food, and such and will manifest inflation. The biggest counter-inflationary factor in this balance is lending - as interest outlays for past purchases  decrease today aggregate demand... Oh, wait!!!...  

264148
Work he's taking away?! You're talking like a Republican would about Mexicans. The guy can do all the stunts he wants. As one poster said, that's like asking me how I'm compensating cab drivers when I choose to drive my own car instead of take a cab. He doesn't have to make excuses or compensate others because of his breadth of his skills!

264232
Why is it in our generation we believe we must improve upon perfection?<br/>Yes, this is my rant! Are we so childish we cannot be trusted to have a moment of unplanned programming? Every second at a baseball game and in particular in between every inning the moronish games . I'll admit to liking the Presidents races in Washington and tee shirt shooting. Walk up music? Idiocy and a childish dumbing down of the game. How about focusing on fundamentals such as bunting, hit &amp; running and stealing bases and less time on what music will be played. Get music out of sports! It does not belong!

264308
Even if an officer is wrong, his actions can be construed as reasonable?!?<br/><br/>Take an already uneven situation, between a citizen and an officer operating<br/>under the color of authority, for whom everyone is a suspect, add in some fear and uncertainty, and arrive at a plausible argument for shooting first.  <br/><br/>Dr. Lewinski's arguments, used at the level of nation states, are perfectly<br/>suited to the ideology of preemptive war.  Like the one we conducted against<br/>Iraq.

264790
Why don't we just require a million dollars to vote then? It would be the same rule for everyone. If people can't earn it, then that's on them!<br/><br/>Same reasoning, isn't it? What am I missing?

265221
Do you keep your cats inside?  Our cat was an inside cat for many years and for the first few years of my children's lives.  Our cat was insufferable.  He threw up everywhere, scratched the floor  and carpet and was scratching and biting me.  When we moved to a house where he could go outside and we put him outside, we noticed a huge difference!  He goes outside for most of the day, just lounging around in our backyard, but he is much calmer and so are we.  There's much less cat hair in the house and the litter box doesn't need to be cleaned as often, so life is better.  Winters are tough, though, when he has to be inside most of the time.<br/><br/>As a cat owner, I would not at all judge someone who decides that having cats is too much.  Your city might have a rescue organization that can help re-home them.  Somebody else could give them a good home.  We would never get a dog because the amount of work is just too much.

265268
Seriously? Gender biased much? Voting for a woman because she's a woman is as bad as voting for a candidate just because he's a man.<br/><br/>How about voting for the best candidate? Now there's a concept for you. <br/><br/>Go Bernie!!!

265304
Why is the NY Times sucking up to the "progressive" Mitch Landrieu?   He's the village idiot.  Didn't notice that 1/3 of his police force quit!<br/><br/>One should ask if the Landrieus are receiving kickbacks from the criminal elements in the city.   There is no other explanation for Mitch Landrieu's behavior.   <br/><br/>There is the smell of corruption hanging over the Landrieu administration, the police department, the parish attornies, and the judges in New Orleans.   There is no other reason for such terrible crime levels.<br/><br/>Always follow the money and you will find the reason for this kind of mess.

265618
Are his current songs his or Martin's? They don't sound different from much of the other top 40 stuff. As far as forsaking "Who he is" - who he is is obviously evolving. The guy has made a calculated decision to become the biggest in the world, a decision that involves a lot of compromise. He wants to be as big as Michael Jackson and he may be yet! As far as the content, he is obviously still singing about sex and drugs. For example, I can't feel my face = cocaine. I was much more intrigued by the anonymity he chose in his earlier career, but at a certain point he chose a different path.

265719
DL - You may have heard the lullaby?  Those are the lyrics usually sung as "Brahms' Lullaby".  Surely you have heard that, no matter how limited your "pop culture" interest/knowledge!

265735
Shall we extend the Taliban-like progressive purge of all Rebel symbols to a<br/>flag which has overseen the oppression of Native American people for centuries?<br/><br/>From the Trail of Tears to Ash Hollow to Lincoln's order to kill Minnesota Chiefs to Grant's relocation decrees to the Sand Creek Massacre to Wounded Knee to the current Indian ghettoes like Pine Ridge,  the US flag has been a symbol of ethnic-cleansing directed against American Indians.  Out of respect for the First People shouldn't this hateful symbol be removed from all public places and its sale prohibited?<br/><br/>Moreover, all public memorials to politicians which in any way contributed to the oppression of Native Americans should be removed. Lincoln and Grant should be at the top of the list.<br/><br/>Perhaps all people of European descent should also be removed from North America. They are the recipients of the stolen property their ancestors took<br/>from Native Americans.<br/><br/>Imagine how hurtful all of these memorials and symbols, living and inanimate, must be to Native Americans.  Starting with the US flag, they must go!

266553
Maya Rockeymoore states groundless fears? What she is saying is that if our government gets honest and stops wasting tax dollars and illegally robing Peter to pay Paul, Medicare and Social Security will survive. What a dreamer this woman is. Let's look at history because we are good in the USA of repeating it and expecting different results. A program is created to provide for aged Americans for financial and health needs when our work force is unable to continue due to age and or sickness. Logically, without knowing it, had our government left the Social Security and Medicare system alone and not tapped into it, it would be thriving. Along with allowing the control of our Money system to fall into the wrong hands and moving away from the gold reserve standard, a program that should have been increased in strength by tax dollars and  US investments. Uh, could this lady please take a calculator and figure out per person how much each American is going to be liable for when the world calls in our debts? Oh, worse yet, our unsecured debt is double that of our international debt. So in reality, America is sitting or waddling in debt to the tune of over 65 plus trillion dollars and it  is not going down. I would love to look at her solutions. The bottom line is we need to being it all home and close the borders for about 20 years and clean up this mess we have allowed our elected servants to get us into, That my friends is not blind faith, it is stupidity!

266682
I find it interesting that Krugman can justify a separate minimum wage for PR due to it lower productivity rate, but yet not make this same distinction for the mainland???  Either a higher minimum wage works to flow everyone's boat or it doesn't.  You can't have it both ways Paul!

266807
Is there really a difference between Greece and Puerto Rico? Outmigration is present in both places. Manufacturing hit by external factors? Yes, also! In case of Greece by competition of the neighboring Rumania and Bulgaria. Social net as a disincentive to work for low wages? Yes! Greedy investors making bad loans? Your guess!<br/>Differences? IMF not involved in PR? Wait and see! Media attention to Greece well in "favor" of Greece. Greece is apparently more sexy. The good professor had a chance to change that. Look for similarities, please!

Why do you feel that Secretary Clintons use of a private email server is "significant and telling"? Jeb Bush had one as Governor of Florida and only disclosed what he chose and not in a timely matter then proceeded to destroy the server.  I'm waiting for an in depth story on the matter. After all it was a violation of state law!

Is the NY Times aware that Aetna currently only offers a limited "Exclusive Provider" option (aka limited providers) to individual buyers of insurance in NY and NJ? And that starting January 1, 2016  Aetna will no longer cover individual buyers of health insurance in NY and NJ whatsoever?!<br/>I just learned this the hard way after my Cobra ran its 18 month course. But after 12 years of paying premiums to Aetna for a PPO plan  (first 50% under my former employer and then 100% under Cobra) you would think I would get some preferential treatment, particularly as I hardly made any claims. No apparently health insurance is a smash and grab business.

People shot in East New York? What a shocker!!! And then the Times quotes a woman who says the Police don't care? Shocker!! I happen to know one of the EMT's tending to some of those shot...People do care but people are also in a state of forced indifference about a community in which the people ask for the Almighty to help instead of taking control over their families and communities. Same old same old.

So what was it, perhaps forty years ago that Phyllis George, a former Miss America, was placed in the pre-game booth, for Sunday Football?  She was followed by Pam Grier, a great-looking black women, maybe to show diversity.  But, as far as play-by-play or color analysis, the evolution never seemed to be realistic.  It was all for show.<br/><br/>And now, we see our first female "coach", and a referee, a job which does indeed seem to be a real one, starting in the same year.  So, does that mean that more and more women will come out to the games?<br/><br/>The last time that I saw a game in Miami, in the stadium that most people down here still call Joe Robbie Stadium (or JRS), it seemed like more of a fashion show than a ballgame.  Ultra-short shorts, bikinis, halter tops, small shirts sans bras, etc.  There was considerably more action in the stands that day, than on the field.  Oh, and how many steps did they walk up with those ever so high heels? <br/><br/>Now, maybe some more guys will go out to the stadiums, just to watch the girls.  Ticket prices will surely continue rising, however, as stadium "improvements" reduce the number of seats, in order to place couch and club seats, body painted cocktail waitresses, etc.  They even have "dog days"!  All for the fans enjoyment.<br/><br/>Buy hey, you can just go to any of our great beaches and watch the same "game" for free.  Enjoy!<br/><br/><a href="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">http://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a>

America and its arrogance, I mean why are we even having this conversation after sixty years of stupidity?  Is Cuba part of America?  NO!  Why are we still occupying Guantanamo?  I.E., should never have been and do I have to state the obvious; of course it should be dropped immediately; put on the shelves as a distant memory of another botched American foreign policy agenda.

Where is the leadership to change the system?<br/><br/>This arrogant judge deserves a lifetime of adversity and pure stress.<br/>Her mindless and dictatorial judgements clearly show that SHE is the major problem in the destruction of Mrs. Hall's life, (and countless others,) and forgiveness is certainly not warranted! 

268035
Oh, 'each' stop you see you prepare to aid the officer, and with a gun you carry?  How helpful. Are you another Zimmerman? Do you patrol residential areas? Uh, how often do you see these police stops? Where do you walk around, with that gun you carry? I never ever see police stops. <br/><br/>I've only read about them in the paper and then read about the law suit brought against the police for gross excesses,  like over 700,000 a year--is that gross enough for you? And that the judge ruled this unconstitutional. <br/><br/>So the stops have greatly decreased . It was a lot of paranoia, police quotas, and politician vote getting---the whole disgusting, repellent anti constitutional, un American stop and frisk mess!<br/><br/>Maybe self appointed vigilantes are getting bored with less to do. 

268102
So you believe that CMS which knows waste, fraud and abuse consumes $1 trillion of the $3 trillion we spend on healthcare, that's $1 out of every $3 spent that helps nobody but crooks, is the way to go?<br/>Giving everybody an insurance card is just as stupid, as we are finding out now: because insurance cards nor insurance companies give care while physicians and nurses are in short supply and this gets shorter in ratio as we give more insurance cards out. Who do you think gets cut out of care? Single payer will simply be like throwing gas on a raging fire!  

268217
Voting on a Work Day? <br/><br/>That's crazy! So many millions of Americans are in jobs which do not permit them to take time off or, if they do it is unpaid and most cannot afford to lose (given already pitiful pay rates) ANY time from paid work.<br/><br/>That ONE THING ALONE would make it very difficult for million to vote.<br/><br/>Not to mention anyone who has been in Jail. How does such mean the loss for the rest of one's life such a basic right?

How can this judge be so myopic?  Granted, Mrs Hall should not have been drinking and driving but it appears, according to the article, that she is not an alcoholic nor has a problem with alcohol in general.   <br/><br/>It was Christmas Day!  How many people do we know drink on Christmas Day?  I have but I know enough to limit it to 2 drinks period, and that's IF I do.<br/><br/>She is a first time offender with no marks on her license or any type of record.  A working, tax paying citizen who because of the onerous requirements this stupid judge imposed, she loses her jobs, is almost into bankruptcy and who knows how long her marriage will last.<br/><br/>Where is the sense in law?  Yes there are many people who should not be on the roads and yes, it is completely wrong to drink and drive but where is her common sense?  Does she have any?<br/><br/>I'm sorry but if there is any judicial oversight administration, she would definitely be in line for a thorough review.<br/><br/>The damage this judge has caused should be case enough to have her own license revoked.

"At what point do you say, you have to work?"<br/><br/>What if there are no jobs??  Are you not aware of the facts, RJ?  People don't go on welfare because they are lazy, it's because they need to survive.  There are no jobs in many parts of Appalachia, so screaming in their face "Get a job!" just makes you feel better but it doesn't solve the problem (which is what liberals, despite your insults, are trying to do).

Why is the Public Editor responses hard to find? Why isn't this the Public Editor on the front page or highlighted and easy to find on the website? What are you afraid of?I feel your readers should be informed about the NYT bias and misreporting concerning HRC. Instead of The Times reporting facts its helped participate in creating the perception of HRC being untrustworthy. The Times and Ms Dowd have helped shape the bogus charge. She's been First Lady, elected NY Senator twice, held the post of Sect of State, successful author, probed, vetted etc. Are you know saying she's not trustworthy? Really? What does it take? How transparent does one have to be? Enough!

Put a sweater on in summer?  How wasteful is that!  Presumably you're also an advocate of having to wear light t-shirts indoors in the winter, because of the excessive heat?<br/><br/>Why not raise the indoor temps in summer, and lower them in winter, so we can all wear season-appropriate clothing?  We'd all save a lot of money, and reduce the impact on the environment.

269287
"supposedly light punishment can severely disrupt a life"?<br/><br/>Isn't punishment for a crime supposed to "disrupt a life"?  Isn't that part of the punishment aspect, and also part of the intended deterrent effect to other people?  (BOTH are valid parts of punishment, not vindictive aspects.)  It may be "supposedly light punishment" (the Times characterization, not the legal system's!) but it's still punishment for a convicted crime.<br/><br/>And I love the way the Times always glosses over REPEAT violations people commit, as if they don't matter!  <br/><br/>Sorry, but the repeat violations -- although minor, admittedly -- suggest someone who, sadly, hasn't learned the lesson that she's supposed to follow instructions and obey the law!  Why not just 'ask permission' as told?  Again, this woman caused her own problems!<br/><br/>"then repeatedly called Mrs. Hall into court for violations like failing to ask permission before moving to a different unit in her apartment complex"

I think it sounds delish but 'recipes for health' tag?..it is a delicious alternative for deep fried cheesecake...but healthy not so much! Butter..brown sugar...ice cream? The only two ingredients that are healthy are the peaches and almonds! I'm a fan of anything that involves sugar and butter so count me in but mislabed as 'healthy'

Why not raise the temperature a few degrees so that women are only slightly, but not bone-chillingly, cold and men are only slightly, but not suffocatingly, hot? Then everyone will be slightly uncomfortable. Think of the camaraderie!

His support is narrow?! Oh, I beg to differ. I was at a house part this past Wednesday and sitting next to me were two self-proclaimed conservatives, two independents, and two Obama Democrats.<br/><br/>This is a demographic theme among his supporters at such events.<br/><br/>This article is nothing more than an attempt to put Senator Sanders in a box, close the lid, and claim him unimportant. <br/><br/>Bern Baby Bern!

269745
So, Pam Belluck, what is the recommended summer and/or winter temperature, in degrees? Surely Doctors Kingma and Lichtenbelt were more specific in their conclusions. This article is maddening--- it's like saying "We've discovered the cure for cancer!" but never mentioning what it is.  

269867
My question for you:  Is there ANY sentence the judge could have imposed in this case that you would have considered too harsh?  If this first-time offender had gotten a year in prison, would you applaud that because drinking and driving is a serious offense?  What if the judge had ordered the woman's hands to be cut off so she could never hold another drink or drive a car again?  Would that be fair and necessary in order to protect the rest of us from drunk drivers?  No one is arguing that a DUI is not a big deal.  No one is saying that the offender should not have received any punishment.  We ARE saying that a month in jail, total financial ruin, loss of car, loss of job, and homelessness is an overly severe and arbitrary punishment that is disproportionate to the offense, and NOT in the best interests of society.  Prior to this catastrophe, the woman was a member of the working poor, supporting herself with her own labor.  Thanks to the judge's vendetta, she is likely going to be dependent on Welfare and private charities for a VERY long time.  And the irony is that even if the woman didn't have a drinking problem before, well...  This whole nightmare would be enough to drive ANYONE to drink!

How about the man stay home when his wife is nursing to do the dishes, make the meals, do the laundry, clean the house, get the groceries and provide emotional support to his partner?  I am sure many man would rather be in a quiet office and hope all these things magically happen on their own.<br/>I suppose if a man were to earn a ton of money working during this time it would be more 'efficient' for him to pay a housecleaner, cook, driver, psycologist etc to do all these things which would support his partner (outsource the work to lower paid help); but a lot of couples don't make that kind of money- so the man needs to step up his game and get his hands dirty doing some dishes and changing some diapers!

269991
OH, great:  Now there is a scientific study which will allow companies to decide to save money by turning the air conditioning down and say that they are doing so not only to help the environment - but to please their female employees as well?<br/>How could anyone be against such a win-win proposition?<br/>Except that - if the temperature goes over 70 degrees, this lowly male gets a headache and can't work anymore.  I feel stifled.  I literally couldn't exist in such an office.  And - surprise - I can't just take off a sweater or throw off a blanket to compensate.  My choice would be to quit and find a more accommodating job and environment.<br/>So, ladies and our cost-cutting managers - turn down the temperature and make it possible for us all to get some work done!

When I visited NY a few summers ago from home in Hawai’i when the temps in NY were hovering at 100 degrees I would stop men and say “Why are you wearing suit coats?  It’s HOT!”  I told them that Honolulu was a progressive metropolis of one million people and NO ONE wore suits and ties..No one!<br/><br/>They had no answer.  “Man up!  Get together and make a NEW fashion statement called intelligent design.” (Sorry!)  Wearing ties, sports coats, vests, and suits is just..plain..dumb.  And with climate change and warming it only makes sense to drop the coat and tie.  Right? Right!

270193
Are men still wearing suits?!?  How quaint.  The last time I worked in an office in the 80's Friday's were "no-suit" day.  I thought that things would have progressed by now.  Living in the SF Bay Area, no techie would be caught dead wearing one.  Who/where are these suit people?

270616
I confess I haven't read all 200+ comments wonder if I am the only person<br/>whose joints begin to ache as soon as I enter any air-conditioned building?<br/>I am a menopausal woman so one would assume I would be grateful for any<br/>air-conditioning I could find! However as soon as I enter a mall, supermarket,bank or my own workplace my arms, legs, shoulders and feet begin to ache. It is a joy to go out into the 80-90 degree summer heat or sit in my hot parked car and have the aches magically disappear. Wearing a winter sweater to work under my lab coat doesn't help. Perhaps retirement on a dry, sunny island in Greece is the answer...

I guess this is a case of out of *nose*, out of mind?? The photo of trash includes so much that is recyclable, including food waste. And the idea about the trash ending up being just carted away...where's away? Residents should be accountable for their trash. I'd love to live AND work on Roosevelt Island because then I could be hired to educate the residents about how to be present occupants, too. As the article points out, "the source is the same: People" -- So true! The source of bad behavior, the source of good behavior. And so it goes...away, I guess. 

270882
Excuse me, what do you know of these people's lives and how much they need "bettering?"  There is no mention of their not having jobs or otherwise contributing to the community.  All you really know about them is that they thought they couldn't afford to live in a market-rate apartment.  If people who can't afford to live in market-rate apartments in NYC are by definition not living worthy lives, most of the U.S. is a bunch of lazy slackers.<br/><br/>And..."free?"  They pay rent!  

270977
Actually what it raises is this question: how seriously should we take anyone who takes "Climategate," seriously?<br/><br/>The point's the science, nature, public policy, little things like the human future as well as the future of life on earth, not you lot running around stealing stuff, selectively editing it, reading it cockeyed, and then running around more while yelling, "Gotcha, you statist Stalinists!" <br/><br/>Want to really, really upset a good scientist? Go to school and study. Do the fieldwork. Prove them wrong. Publish.<br/><br/>But that take, ah, wossname, ah yes, "work." Instead, of course, you lot prefer to get on a liberal paper's liberal website, and screech endlessly about how them liberals won't give you a voice. <br/><br/>That's easy, kids. The actual work's hard, but worth it. You should try it some time.

Maybe I missed it, but who does the cooking?  The cleaning?  The grocery shopping?  Pets allowed?  Etc., etc.  This scenario doesn’t sound at all appealing to me.  But if some people like it, then all the best to them!

I was married for 9 years to a man who came home from work and the first words out of his mouth were "What's wrong?"  "NOTHING," was my increasingly frustrated reply. This went on day after day. I've been married to my current husband for 13 years. When I come home from work, the first words out of his mouth are, "Hi, sweetie!" I still have a RBF, but he knows the real me.

You don't think the CIA are conducting cyber espionage on the Chinese ??!!!<br/>Come On ! They have no qualms spying on friendly European governments! The constant media attention on possible Chinese intelligence coups are simply part of ongoing campaigns to discredit China in the public mind as part of the information war, and judging from most of the comments here, it's been very effective. If you believe any major country, and that includes the Europeans, desist from cyber espionage because they "play by the rules", you must be particularly naive. That's why it's called "espionage", and not "research". That is why the CIA and MI5 exist - do you think they're there so they can behave ? They're spy agencies - what do you think they actually do? Or do you think they only use men in grey Macs with trick cigarette lighters?

And who made the projects that way? They did not start out that way. Was it just an accident they are crime-ridden and urine-filled? Is it racism or classicm or some other 'ism' that somehow made people who were lucky enough to receive housing subsidies trash their own environment?<br/><br/>Does anyone really believe that if those huge housing projects were middle class, the stairwells would be used as toilets?<br/><br/>The only people who think it is not the fault of the residents of these projects are those who have never lived around poor people.<br/><br/>It is those of us who have escaped, using the tried and true methods of getting an education and working hard for years, that know the truth, which is that the best and brightest leave, generation after generation, leaving behind the old, the sick, and the dregs of society, who prey on them.<br/><br/>It is always the worst of Conservatives (no funding!) and Liberals (everyone's a victim!) who create a perfect storm.

Is there no one who can step in and help this poor woman and her husband? This story is almost unbelievable! She should be refunded a large amount of the money she and her husband have had to pay, and she should definitely be given back her driver's license. What happened to her can't be called "justice."

271302
A concerned commenter asks:<br/><br/>"Is there no one who can step in and help this poor woman and her husband?"<br/><br/>Of course: you can. It shouldn't be hard to find her and then to help her in any way you see fit.<br/><br/>Pardon me, though, if I decline to help her. I'm not wild about drunk drivers, especially those who get off with probation and then complain that the conditions imposed on them are too harsh.<br/><br/>But you -- by all means, help her!

"1) If you cover up too much, you're matronly and aging yourself"<br/><br/>According to whom?  The other women in the office?  I guarantee you no guy could actually get away with saying this to a woman, nor should they.  Any dress code complaints should go to HR directly.<br/><br/>"2) You can't choose anything too masculine"<br/>See answer to #1<br/><br/>"3) No repeating! If you like that blouse that actually keeps you warm, don't get it in three colors, because someone will notice and point it out."<br/><br/>Again, see answer to #1<br/><br/>"4) Wear a skirt once in awhile! But shave your legs, and wear stockings and wear appropriate heels, but not the ones that make your legs look stocky."<br/><br/>Yet again, see answer to #1<br/><br/>"5) Spend less than $200"<br/><br/>Fair enough.<br/><br/>Overall, this doesn't seem to be a male colleague issue, but women on women "crime" so to speak, and office "politics".  Also, just grow up.  Who really cares about the office gossip when it comes to dress code?

271550
OK, that's one opinion from one self-proclaimed retired criminal defense attorney, which hardly makes it an established "fact that the [ENTIRE?, presumably nationwide!] criminal legal process ... is largely institutionalized jim crow [sic]."  <br/><br/>It's most probable that minorities and the poor are occasionally (often?) treated less well than others, but wouldn't you think that a highly experienced and quite opinionated attorney could and would provide some objective evidence to support his extravagant claim of there being "widespread and consistent maltreatment of minorities and the poor"?  <br/><br/>An experienced litigator would be accustomed to providing evidence to support a claim, and, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof." --  Marcello Truzzi

What procedure is used at the NYT to decide what series to recap? Is anyone watching Last Tango in Halifax which proceeds Poldark on PBS on Sunday nights? Why is Poldark recapped but not LTH?<br/>My view of season 1 of Poldark is that the actors are terrific, but the direction is not. The scenery is magnificent, but I find myself muttering "not one more long shot of a gallop along the coast!" far too often. If the series must be truncated due to time and advertisement pressures, then a (single) view of the wildflowers or the Harlequin Romance-type gallop along the Cornish coast can be eliminated, and not the plot.

Have you ever made cheese fondue? Try this: Cook the spaghetti in little water so that the water gets very starchy or add a teaspoon of dissolved cornstarch to the reserved pasta water and keep the temperature low so that the cheese doesn´t clump up. The additional starch helps the cheese bind to the water and make the sauce. I tried it last with a dish of Gnocchetti Sardi in a water based sauce of Pecorino Truffato and Saffron. It turned out just perfect!!!

Aborting some Indian fetuses is good, but selectively aborting Indian female fetuses is bad because?!  At least be consistent man.  Of course providers want to keep a corner on the market, who wouldn't.  They want to make money.  The governments job is to balance public safety with market demand, but abortion is pretty simple:  Crunch-pull, crunch-pull., maybe give Motrin.  You are definitely on the right track.  India could do them at pharmacies like flue shots.

Where is the head and skin of Cecil the lion now?  After the American dentist discovered that the lion he killed was wearing a collar, he should have contacted authorities to tell them of his mistake; if indeed, it was a "mistake".  Instead, he beheaded and skinned a protected lion, left the carcass and took off with his illegal "trophy".  Disgusting!  If it were truly a mistake, he wouldn't have done this.  The head and skin of Cecil should be returned to Zimbabwe and buried: NOT HUNG ON A WALL!  I have yet to see anyone demanding the return of the remains of Cecil to Africa, so I am asking that the media and people join in on pressuring for the return of Cecil's remains to his home country.

Really?  Republicans continually saying that sound like a petulant child saying "no fair!  You said so!".  I hate to break it to you but sometimes complex things change through no fault of the originator.  And where is the superb Republican plan to increase health care coverage?  Still waiting..... Talk about a lie!

This is so insane -- why don't they just go with the number that really COUNTS, namely how much cold, hard CASH each candidate has received in donations? Objective, inarguable, and not dependent on averages. If we're gonna be a plutocracy, by God, let's ACT like one!

272476
Are you kidding me with these comments? I'm a woman who has to wear a suit to work, and I'm absolutely freezing in a button up and blazer. This isn't a scheme to get away with tank tops in the office! It's extremely difficult to focus when you're constantly uncomfortable.

So, to be open, blunt and honest is to have "fallen"?  The left wants the speech police to filter every word for them and everyone else, otherwise when a blunt truth is spoken they look like someone just sprayed them in the face with lemon juice. Well, get over it.  The lies, misleading and pure fabrication of Hillary and Obama have the rest of us willing to listen to plain, unedited speech. We can decide wether they can act on what they say, which is always the final test.  But to hear anyone in this polarized political environment say what they really think, is indeed refreshing.  Let us enjoy it!

ALEXANDER (broken caps lock button?),<br/><br/>"But politically, she speaks well" - ALEXANDER HARRISON<br/><br/>"Really, it's kind of Orwellian, observing how that works, that rule of Saul Alinsky's, no doubt, that the left employs. Disgusting charges, from the left. Reverse them -- for it is they who point a finger not realizing that they have triple that amount of fingers pointing right back at them, revealing that they are the ones who really discriminate and divide on color and class and sex. We call them out. We don’t let them get away with it.”<br/><br/>-Sarah Palin<br/><br/>"Things must change for our government. Look at it. It isn’t too big to fail. It’s too big to succeed! It's too big to succeed, so we can afford no retreads or nothing will change with the same people and same policies that got us into the status quo. Another Latin word, status quo, and it stands for, ‘Man, the middle-class everyday Americans are really gettin’ taken for a ride.’ That's status quo, and GOP leaders, by the way, y'know the man can only ride ya when your back is bent. So strengthen it. Then the man can't ride ya, America won't be taken for a ride, because so much is at stake and we can't afford politicians playing games like nothing more is at stake than, oh, maybe just the next standing of theirs in the next election."<br/><br/>-Sarah Palin<br/><br/>What was that again about speaking well ALEXANDER?

REHDNY: Is this person, chary of giving his real name, commenting on the present political situation or writing a political tract? I presume that HDNY is not affected by the massive distribution of H-1B visas which has dislocated hundreds of thousands of professional engineers, nor a manual labourer forced to work for lower wages because of O's policy of"Heck, let em all in!" I have a hunch he or she is not only a product of a liberal education, but no doubt teaches in an educational emporium noted for its left wing tendencies. In any case, the "entrefilet(comment)" teaches us nothing except that the writer appears to  have a deep hatred for anyone connected with the GOP, and that her words r so "haineuse" that one might suspect a dangerous mental condition.

ANd just why can't the wealthiest country on earth build more affordable housing with exercise rooms and swimming pools and function rooms?? Oh, the private sector couldn't have 20 year long tax breaks for providing a few units of housing for the poorer!!!   BTW various projects require larger rather than smaller incomes -- I am thinking about some of the Mitchell Lamas..  <br/><br/>I truly wonder where our heads are (at!!).  More and more people are either going to be unemployed or if they don't have a tax-payer supported or government type job will have less and less $$ .. This does not matter at all so long as people can afford the goods and services (housing, transit, medical) -- they need.. and meantime.. how about pushing some sort of birth control everywhere?!!

In what type of office are women expected to wear "low cut" dresses in winter? Very few.  Really, there are certainly areas where men are given an advantage, but clothing choice is not one of them.  Just the opposite.  There is no doubt that women have much more freedom in clothing choice.  I can remember when Al Gore and Dan Rather were made fun of for daring to wear a sweater! Another politician (the name escapes me) was laughed at for donning a flannel shirt. As a culture, we insist on men all dressing alike (look at the presidential candidates), then mock them for being cookie-cutter "suits".

272736
can we just finally acknowledge that men and women are different?!? I know it throws a wrench in the whole equality paradigm, but it's a fact. My space heater  is on high (what a waste of electricity!)  I keep a fleece and a scarf permanently in my cube and always wear long pants in the summer. I am most productive after 6pm when the building's AC shuts off. Thank god for flex schedule!

Right?! I'm dying laughing over here imagining all these fantasy offices where men are bundled in worsted wool and women are in cleavage and spaghetti straps. Come on, people.

How did you come to this conclusion from this article, Tom? I don't see the connection. <br/><br/>By the way, there are 650 million Chinese people who are connected to the internet, not just a fortunate few. Some of them have visited the USA and found it to be quite a let down. A common sentiment on many Chinese language blogs is "America is like a big countryside! so boring..."

are you kidding me? How twisted are we to worry more about a lion than the selling of aborted fetuses ( yes babies ) then an animal.  Sad that we value a lion's life more than human life!

Maybe uneducated peoples?  Maybe selfish, "I'll get some before he gets some!" Mind set.  I don't care because it's not effecting me. (Yet, I don't think.)  (Ha,ja, get it, "I don't think".)   Sad, as the oil age will end soon anyway.  We should have transitioned decades ago.  But then we would have missed out on all these Middle East wars. Oh well.

So how many unwanted babies have you adopted or supported? Talk is cheap. Planned Parenthood DOES NOT use taxes to pay for abortions. Those of us who know all the possible problems that are involved in birth care.  Nature can go crazy.   You adopt unwanted kids, and I will support abortions.  It's America!!

You wish to re-energize the steel industry? Get your JOBS! JOBS! JOBS! lying republicans to pass a long term transportation bill.  Get your "Right to work", "Union busting" republicans to pass a JOBS bill that isn't watered down with defunding anything and everything that might help lower/middle class workers.  Get your "Tax cutes" for "Job creators" republicans to stop incentivizing  moving manufacturing over seas.  Start trickling down as promised Reagonites.  OR do you need more time for it to work still?

Can we talk about the REAL evil in the room?<br/><br/>Big pharma has increased the price of ED drugs to triple what they were five years ago. This is for a well established drug with R&amp;D and other startup costs recovered long ago. There is absolutely NO reason a single 20mg dose of Cialis which cost $12 about five years ago should cost $37 now. $37!!!<br/><br/>This is straight out gouging of the public, and by a remarkable coincidence, all three manufacturers of ED drugs raised their prices by almost exactly the same amount. Some might suspect anti-trust collusion and price fixing was involved.<br/><br/>If we had an FDA and FTC that were not, ironically, impotent, this sort of thing would not be allowed to happen.

Vigilantes? Really? Vigilantes with cell phones? Please give me a break! The Palestinians live under harsh Israeli rule where Israeli, Jewish vigilantes constantly harass their persons and destroy their property, all with the cooperation of the authorities. The Palestinian Authority is corrupt and a quisling to the occupation and lacks any democratic legitimacy. The poor people have suffered enough! It's high time that we Americans see that and stop being complicit in this ongoing crime.

But when we're talking about a family earning $70k, where could they possibly go that wouldn't cause them to have to commute for hours?  That's a laughable sum to afford even a one-bedroom in most parts of Manhattan and close-in Brooklyn.  The problem isn't that people making over 69k are abusing the system, it's that there is no good affordable alternative!  Even if every single resident currently in NYCHA moved out, that wouldn't come close to addressing the housing shortage.  We shouldn't blame the poor and the middle class for this problem.  The solution won't come from evicting slightly-less-poor residents--that will only lead to more of the exact problem you're arguing against in your comment.

How did you come about with the inferences that Ling is without question corrupted? Just because the Chinese gov. (claimed that the Dalai Lama is a pol provocateur trying to stir up Tibetan unrests, Guihurs as terrorists, young HK democratic leaders as hooligans, human rights dissidents tortured for expressing their thoughts) said so doesn't mean it's so. Some Westerners are all emotion kneejerkings and lil or no logics!

Is San Francisco going to pass an ordinance banning football, rugby and hockey because the players might incur a concussion? Heaven forbid, the children might be watching, the horror! The ordinances banning smoking in public places was constitutionally justified because of the dangers of second hand smoke.  Major leaguers have always chewed and spit. While the do-gooder meddlers are at it maybe they should ban recreational cycling because you might get hit by a car. Where does this encroachment on our liberties end?

Where are the women in Congress? why don't they put a bill that limit the men, starting with those in Congress, from access to Viagra, had to have a Vasectomy after two kids and for their wives to go with bed them once every two months? These funnies in Congress only want to prevent poor women from having that access to women's health.  I bet that if one of their  daughters get pregnant their moral goes by the wayside and they take care of it. When men get pregnant, they have a say on what women do with their pregnancies. period!

Wait, so not wanting to be forced to manufacture smiles (because our natural RESTING face is more serious looking) means we are being a man? My normal face makes me a man? And I should force myself to smile for no reason (which means having to train myself to be conscious of my expression at all times - even when walking by myself or not engaging with anyone) in order to be a woman? Can you understand why this is problematic? It's problematic because men are the only ones who care if women are smiling. I've never been told to smile by another female. I am not here for your comfort and visual pleasure and I am no less a woman for refusing to conform to your standards of how my face look. You think it's no big thing because you're a man. No one cares what you look like! No one tells you to wear makeup, have a defined waist, big boobs, big butt, smile more, be less this be more that. Get off your high horse and quit trying to act like you know what's best for women. You are part of the problem! You are the reason this needs to be addressed!

This "element" of society?  Holy smoke! The haredi are coddled and encouraged - through welfare - to continue their imposition of their MEDIEVAL, BARBARIC ways on the rest of Israeli society. Those chickens will come home to roost, and I doubt you'll be calling them an "element" of society when they do.

Am I misunderstanding something from the quoted paragraph below?<br/><br/>"Under that arrangement, signed during a visit to Beijing by Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, the United States would be able to repatriate many of the tens of thousands of Chinese currently in the United States awaiting deportation, some in American detention facilities. In return, the United States would help the Chinese track down wealthy fugitives from China living in the United States who might also be breaking American laws."<br/><br/>The "arrangement" will send back illegal Chinese to China AND then help the Chinese track track down more of their "fugitives"- these the "RICH ONES".<br/><br/>I thought "an arrangement" was  mutual benefiting to both sides.<br/><br/>Exactly what is the US getting in return?<br/><br/>More spying, theft of American citizen data and who knows what else!

274538
What do you do about Jeb Bush?  He's too clever and experienced to say something stupid or frightening or offensive but he rigged the theft of the 2000 election so his idiot brother could become president and drag us into an unnecessary, unjust war.  Isn't that arguably much worse than Trump saying these offensive things? Jeb Bush is an enemy of democracy!!!  He's adept at seeming mild and reasonable in his public appearances and speeches but he's by far the most dangerous, unprincipled candidate. <br/><br/>I worry much more about a sleazy entitled guy from a family of rich crooks who's bagged more PAC money from corporate interests than anyone else and has already proven he's an enemy of one person one vote and of people being able to make medical decisions for their comatose spouses.  I'll take Trump any day.  He's a gasbag but he's likely a more decent than Jeb Bush.  Most people are.

There's a senior discount at Dunkin' Donuts?!!<br/><br/>I buy Dunkin' Dark, three one-pound bags at a time.  From time to time they have specials where a third pound is free, and I have noticed that I have been getting the freebie even when it's not advertised.  I haven't wanted to ask in case it made the clerk change her mind.  Maybe that's a senior discount, or a regular-customer discount (they'd know from my credit card I think), or something like that.<br/><br/>Even without a discount, of course, it's worth the extra walk to DD instead of going to the Starbuck[no-apostrophe]s in my building.

Will? Are! What's interesting is people blame rich people moving into high rises. That's not the problem. They too are cmplaining that there's no where to buy groceries without booking a flight uptown. The problem is tourism. It's drove up commercial real estate. Greedy landlords want their dollars, so they wait with an empty space for some lousy quality expensive place that tourists love. Kills the neighborhood. I know, mine is dead.

Can we take a moment to talk about Key Food instead of Duane Reade? Key Food and the Met Supermarket are the only two "grocery" stores available in my neighborhood--sure, they're chain supermarkets, and their non-perishable items are cheaper than going downstairs to the bodega, but their produce? Gross! It's almost always half rotten by the time it gets to these stores--at least I can count on my bodega to have fresh apples and bananas (and Boar's Head deli meat, if we deign to go there) instead of the mush Key Food attempts to pass off as produce.

@Regina: How often do you read the Times? This otherwise fine paper prints several articles per week about women suffering under the thumb of the indifferent (or malicious) male population. And alleged gender-imbalance tends to be the point of these articles. This article begins with an urging to end the "Office Conspiracy." What are we doing this time? Freezing women (and Destroying The Planet!) simply because we collectively agree that "men should wear suits to work." Vanity, for all those entitled males, is more important than the welfare of women, Mother Earth included. <br/><br/>     Consider another angle: Unlike women, men are MADE to wear suits, even in unsuitable weather.  Were men given the same latitude as women in choice of dress, most would be more than happy to dress down. Yes, the suit makes the man...needlessly uncomfortable.

276522
Why even publish these stories?  Is there a proposal, other than handwringing and crypto-nostalgia?  The Times is foursquare behind real estate and commercial development and has been for as long as I can remember.  It pays lip service to preserving existing residential protections such as rent stabilization, but I know of no concrete ideas from the Times about sustaining the character of individual neighborhoods, including their commercial character.  And now we have the current situation where it's entirely possible to live in a (wealthy) neighborhood with no supermarket (let alone bodegas), no place to get dry cleaning done, no place to buy fresh flowers, no place to get shoes repaired, no place to buy a book or a newspaper or a pack of cigarettes, but a hundred different places to eat dinner or get a glass of wine.  Nice!

The LIQUOR STORE answer took me back to my earliest years on the Upper West Side, the early '80s, when most liquor stores were dismal, dingy spaces with a thick plastic (bulletproof?) shield between the sales clerk and the customer. It was like the back of a huge taxi, with a slot for slipping your cash through and getting your change. But now that I'm thinking about it, didn't you have to ask for what you wanted, because all the stock was behind the plastic shield? My memory stops at the slot; I didn't actually spend much time in liquor stores. (No, really!)<br/><br/>Anyway, things has changed. Now liquor stores are light-filled, spotless emporiums. They're the equivalent of the cleaned-up Times Square: safer, but uninteresting.<br/><br/>BTW, I liked the puzzle.

Does New York really want to look just like the boring cities where there is nothing but chain stores? I lived in Fort Worth, TX and there was a Walgreens on every other block. Miles of sprawl and big box stores but very little that was unique or interesting. NYC, don't become the dull cities of the middle of the country!

Were there similar senses of outrage when Palestinians murdered Israeli children? If there were, the Times would certainly have reported them.<br/>But of course, Palestinian racism and bigotry is commonly ignored!<br/><br/>Who is it that rejected the two-state solution? Have you read the founding documents of both the P.L.O. and Hamas? For example, Article 13 of the Hamas Covenant unequivocally rejects all forms of non-violent conflict resolution in favor of perpetual war against Israel. You can read it at: <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp" title="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp" target="_blank">http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp</a><br/><br/>In 2000 and again in 2008, Israeli governments made offers to return 95% of land captured in the 1967 "Six Day War" in exchange for peace, which were ignored respectively by Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, without any counter-offers, or initiatives of their own. Refusal to make a decision is in and of itself a decision: acquiescence in the status-quo! As acceptance of the Israeli offers, or alternatively, the Arab League Peace Plan, would constitute "de-facto" recognition of Israel's right to exist within "secure and recognized boundaries" per UNSCR 242 and 338, Palestinians prefer the status-quo. Under International Law, Israel as the victorious belligerent of the 1967 war, may retain captured land, until possession is modified by treaty. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uti_possidetis" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uti_possidetis" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uti_possidetis</a><br/><br/>When Palestinians are ready for peace and independent statehood, they will negotiate for them. Until then, they seem to prefer the status-quo!

Your despair is evident, but the questions remain: how bad will it be, and how fast will it get that bad?  Giving up speeds the process and worsens the outcome.  Anything we do to slow the process saves lives.  Take heart, and fight!

What happened to the Republic? We have an elected Congress and Senate who need to weigh in on matters that involve us all. Skyrocketing electric bills-on purpose might be  an area where we, the governed, need to approve of. We are the government -not the Times editorial board or the Democratic Party Platform!<br/> Obama is using the un-elected and unaccountable subsets of our government (the courts and the appointed ones) to impose far reaching and economically painful controls on our energy supply and the kicker is: it will do NOTHING that Obama says it will do!<br/>How in the world will closing coal fired generators in America-while the 2nd and 3rd world are INCREASING THEIR co2 output- do anyone any good at all? Except, perhaps to cripple our already weak economy further.<br/>And who pays the bill for this junk science? Those who can least afford it.As always.<br/>Not only will this "mandate" do nothing, cost far more than forecast and destroy parts of the country that are already in trouble but Obama has NO authority to do so to begin with! We elected a chief executive; not a Dictator.<br/>Someone, should tell Obama that.

Allure? TV-generated! Look what TV revenues have done to education with football dollars. Politics has followed down that breathless road. When I first came to America, candidates' managers were expected to say that campaign really begins after Labor Day. We are now 13 months from that Labor Day. <br/><br/>Of course, the print and e-media are dragged along in the slipstream of TV. Where would they all be without Donald? Writing about Jeb?

I am reminded of the (apocryphal?) story about Adlai Stevenson: He was approached after a speech by a woman who said "Mr. Stevenson, every thinking American is behind you!" to which he replied "Madam, that is what I'm afraid of."

When I listen to Trump insult people -- he thinks McCain is a loser for having been captured?!? -- I ask myself whether his words were due to a brain spasm or whether he really despises the people he's just p*ssed on.  In this case, I think it's the latter.  I am flabbergasted that his popularity didn't disappear after he insulted McCain.<br/><br/>By way of contrast, I thought it was silly that people lit into Obama for saying the US has 57 states (or whatever), and it was silly that people trashed Sarah Palin for making a couple of historical errors.<br/><br/>To me, it's more important to stick around a bit and see if the person retracts words that were -- at best -- poorly chosen.  Trump doubles-down on the insults.  There's nothing presidential about him. He's a buffoon.

278343
You are all so sure Trump will never be President?<br/><br/>But that aside let me see if I can decipher what you are saying here. Trump is a product of the times we live in? Because so many Republicans are dissatisfied with their lives and the world around them they were just bound to gravitate to a self absorbed bloviator?<br/><br/>Really? So what you are saying is that Trump is Obama's fault! For it is sure that Obama being twice elected is the only thing the registered Republican has to be unhappy about. In every other way the world is their oyster.<br/><br/>Face it, David, you all brought this on yourselves. It is quite possible that if something unfortunate does happen to Hilary and Bernie is the Democratic candidate that you may well have The Donald as your President.<br/><br/>Then where will we be???

278480
No-Drama Obama? Remember that appellation? Obama bore gross insults to himself, to his wife and children and to his mother, with a steady eye on the real tasks before him. A country shivering on the edge of an economic cliff; two wars eating lives, limbs, minds, and treasure. He did let a corner of his control open a bit when he said something like "you're alright, Hillary." <br/><br/>Hillary has also borne what for most of us would be unbearable--a torrent of gutter-level abuse from all levels of the right-wing. She was wrong in calling it a vast right-wing conspiracy. It was vast and right-wing, but it was, and is, out in the open, visible to anyone with open eyes.<br/><br/>Now, Obama's no-drama spell is over. Hillary has many months to go before the real campaign begins. She'll be baited and provoked. I hope she keeps her cool. I really do look forward to a real debate in this political season--Hillary and Bernie and others. The other side is a sick joke. (Is that sufficiently insulting? I can do better/worse!)

So tell me EXACTLY how you plan to "bring to an end both ISIS and al Qaeda?"<br/><br/>These are just the latest and most famous heads of radicalized Islam.  Add to them Nusra Front, Boko Haram, the Taliban, Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-e-Islami, Hezbollah, AQAP, al Shabaab, and so on, to name a FEW.<br/><br/>Don't forget  the worst of all: the Wahabis/Salafis who are created by our "ally" Saudi Arabia!<br/><br/>And all the "moderates" you hear about?  Like the Syrian Free Army?  They aren't moderates.  They are just as awful as all the rest, but they enjoy favor from ignorant Americans who think they're the "good guys"  (Don't believe me, look at all the videos of Syrian Free Army personnel beheading their victims).<br/><br/>You see, one cannot win a war against a concept using bombs and drones.  We cannot defeat "radicalized Islam"<br/><br/>So we can send in the troops again.  Send them to Syria, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Turkey.  We can blow everything up.  And then... another one of these groups will spring up *the second* we leave.<br/><br/>Unless you envision permanent occupation of the entire Middle East and northern Africa?<br/><br/>with what money?<br/>with what troops?<br/><br/>Get out of there. There are NO good guys.  They all hate us.  They just use us for weapons and money.  So stop giving them weapons and money.<br/><br/>wall ourselves off from them and let them butcher each other in their religious war.

278744
"Freedom Force"<br/>Well, perhaps you might want to enlighten us all as to how you would determine what people are WORTH?   Were all the paper shufflers on Wall street worth the billions they were paid in bonuses and was the CEO Mr. Foulds WORTH the $400 million he walked away with after Lehman Bros. filed bankruptcy?  <br/><br/>Up until now, it is the system you advocate that has FAILED MISERABLY!

Biggest Threat? American "Officials"! They are never even named anymore. The complete foreign policy is rooted in a refusal to see and appreciate other cultures.<br/>But at home we have Monsanto, intent on poisoning all living creatutes in the name of an imagined Big Lie World Food Crisis, and the Haliburton-enabled Frackers who will soon poison this lands waters. So who really cares about Isis of Al Quaeda?  And bringing up the rear, this uptight newspaper which eliminates commentary on a whim. Yes! You're employed by the Dark, you who are reading this. Enjoy your money. It is time for a Second American Revolution.

In what way did including his location information make this story any better?  You might as well have printed a close up Google Map with a big red X on his house.  This was not germane to the story, and was flat out irresponsible journalism.  The fact that he speaks broken English, uses emojis, bought his house from a basketball player, and had drinks with his neighbor brings absolutely zero to an otherwise interesting story.  How about a little editing next time?!?

'No Sanity Claus'<br/><br/>That's why I always wonder - how can somebody who knows this - compare it to any type of governance in Europe??!<br/><br/>I mean - for sure governance in the EU is as difficult as you expect from a union of so many diverse and still independent countries.<br/>But compared to the US???!!!<br/>How can an US economist seriously write: 'So any State of the US automatically receives aid on a scale beyond anything conceivable in Europe.'<br/><br/>How can an US economist seriously write:  'Overall, however, the US story is one of bad times that fall well short of utter disaster. And the saving grace in this situation is big government — a federal system that provides a crucial safety net for American citizens in times of need, wherever they happen to live.'<br/><br/>Oh - sorry an US economist didn't write that...?

A third division team doesn't need its local newspaper? Rubbish! They regularly draw fewer than 10,000 in a stadium that has a capacity of over 15K.<br/>The local paper should run a series of articles describing its efforts to get the owner, manager and players on the record and see what happens.<br/>This is not to say that much of value is ever gleaned from interviewing a player. The best example is Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) schooling Nuke LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) in how to give content free interviews when he gets to "the Show" at the end of Bull Durham.<br/>Footballers tend to be more candid, but for every Paul Scholes or the late great George Best (see his evaluation of the "skills" of David Beckham), there are dozens or scores of numbing drones.

SAY WHAT?  Mitch McConnell, whose main goal  in Congress since Obama was elected has been to oppose everything Obama proposes merely because he's Obama, has outdone himself.  In making remarks about Obama's initiative to increase efforts to moderate global climate change, McConnell has actually said is it a triumph of blind ideology over sound policy and honest compassion.  Shockingly he was not speaking about himself, as he is the most guilty of blind ideology trumping reason.  He's even set himself against an essentially market-based solution that worked with ending acid rain and will work with slashing carbon emissions!  All because Obama made the proposal.  Obama has said repeatedly that if anyone else has a better idea to improve his plan, his door is only open.  So far the only times I've known of McConnell darkening his doorway was to do battle with Obama, eat a meal with him or play golf.  Great job, Mitch!  It's hard to imagine what could be clearer evidence of sloth, ideology and meanness than how McConnell has done his job so far.  Obama's plan will lessen our carbon footprint in spite of McConnell, not because of his leadership in addressing the most pressing issue of our day:  Global climate change.  Ah, I forgot, down where McConnell lives, they believe the Earth was created in 7 days and that science is so much hooey.  Well science has stopped acid rain and can do much to slow global climate change, no thanks to Mitch and the great conservative cabal.

WHAT WOULD PUTIN DO?  Members of the EU had better trouble themselves, and quickly, to take heed of Putin's designs on it.  Beware what's happening in Ukrania.  There's plenty more where that came from.  The mafiosi run Russia, and they're not a bunch of Boy Scouts.  Left to its own paltry devices, the EU may well find member nations occupied by local mafiosi.  Angela Merkel's cold-blooded remark to the little girl who was crying about the plights of migrants, that there are many thousands of them that want to come to this country and we can't have that, was chilling.  It was a reminder of Germany's dark past and its treatment of The Other.  She grew up under a communist dictatorship in East Germany.  If Angela does not wake up and hold the reigns of leadership firmly while thinking of what Adenauer did to heal his country, Vladimir Putin is waiting in the wings to change the course of Germany, the EU and the history of the 21st century.  And then there is the combined threat of extremist groups on the right and left being resurrected by Merkel's unforgiving, inhumane treatment of the EU's debtor nations.  They will provide fertile ground for Putin's ideas to flourish.  Add to that global climate change and you can see that Europe is facing a perfect storm.  Perfectly horrible at that.  Look at the mess we've got here in the US among warring political factions whose most significant achievement is letting the infrastructure rot.  Don't go there Angela!

What preventable infections? Are there vaccines for all of these? You do realize statistically that most of the diseases for which we have vaccines today are contracted by newly or currently vaccinated, right? Your comment is vague enough to fit the standard OP of manipulation and circular logic that supports continued one sided discussion of this issue in mainstream media. Also, what other issues were these stillborn and liveborn babies dealing with at time of birth or in utero? What were their conditions-socioeconomic, prexisting, etc? You do realize that every condition or infection does not have a corresponding vaccine, right? Of course, with nearly 300 vaccines in the development pipeline, I'm sure they're working on it. Feel free to play russian roulette with YOUR child in experimenting with all of these vaccines. That is the point: We are all free to take medical risks and make such decisions on behalf of our own children. The state does not have that right. Nor does group think or mob justice, PC paradigm of the day. By their own admission, vaccines do not undergo the same rigorous or lengthy testing, b/c the 'are a public health measure' and therefore we simply 'must get them to the market' for people to use! LOL. It IS a market, first of all. We are consumers, purchasing vaccines. They are not free. Secondly, that statement confirms that they are not rigorously tested. So that part of the vaccine argument is null and void.

You mean the 'professionals and experts' that big pharma advertises to? Surely people have seen John Oliver's Marketing to Doctors bit? It's hilarious as well as enlightening. Youtube. 'Real experts'. Um, I never plan to relinquish my decision making to experts of any kind. I am quite capable of researching, synthesizing, drawing conclusions and deciding, thanks. It's Orwellian to think how many advocate a life of decisions based on programs and government/industry backed 'research' led by supposed experts-in all areas of our lives. Life is meant to be lived, not programmed. And that includes risks as well as decisions. A parent or person does not need a set of initials to validate what they have experienced or observed. This is twilight zone anymore in this country! What happened to the USA? Feel free to spend your time 'consulting experts'; I'll be busy living. And the bottom line is: YOU don't get to decide that I must follow your format for doing so---medical decisions included. Cheers!

Who's worse? The scientists that hid evidence of the autism-vaccine link? (<a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destroy-vaccine-autism-study-documents/)" title="https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destroy-vaccine-autism-study-documents/)" target="_blank">https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destro...</a> Or a lazy, apathetic Congress that has been bought by Big Pharma, that they won’t even act anymore? Vaccine manufacturers admit that vaccines are neither tested nor approved, according to their own package inserts. But nobody bothers to read them. There are 100s of billions of dollars at stake. They are being fought for and protected by armies of tens of thousands of lobbyists. This is not a conspiracy. It is a well-coordinated, multi-faceted attack on freedom, being carried out by an army of well-dressed executives covering Congress at the state &amp; federal level; covering the media; and purposefully creating animosity between the rest of us with a contrived campaign of Pro vs Anti – in order to keep our attention off the manufacturers and riveted on each other… As a CEO, I’ve seen these types attacks before. I’m sure anyone who has been paying attention, has. it seems like the news is coming from everywhere on some topic or product. This isn’t about vaccines causing autism – they do. This isn’t about whether or not they’re effective – they’re not. And it's not about whether or not they're pregnancy is the best time for one - it's not! It’s about money. Lots of it. More than you can imagine. And pregnant mothers are just another avenue for making more money.

Does anybody remember a place on Decatur Street that had a 55 gallon oil drum of boiling water on the sidewalk and a huge wire basket filled with crawfish that they'd lower into the boiling water? Right there on the sidewalk! I loved seeing that place and eating there. For about twenty years it was there every time I went back. When I went back in 2009 it was gone. I think there is yet another t-shirt shop there now. I know a 55 gallon drum of boiling water on the sidewalk probably isn't safe, but that was New Orleans to me, a place where you saw things that existed no where else.

TRADE OFF  Accede to China's demand to extradite one of her citizens?  I'd put a lot of conditions on that one as a tradeoff.  The Chinese knowingly sell the US and other countries drug precursors that are used to feed the drug mafias and cartels of the world.  They also sell substandard food that has poisoned Americans.  Not to mention the inhuman working conditions of the average Chinese citizen.  I'm not particularly in favor of helping out the wealthy and well-connected.  But it depends where the 1% is located.  If it's someone located in China, why should we help a drug cartel that operates openly and with impunity to produce drug precursors?  But if it is a wealthy, connected Chinese citizen who has not endangered American lives, who wishes to seek asylum according to US laws, I say fine!  So long as, being of the 1%, they pay their fair share in US taxes.  None of what I write here in my private little fantasy world is likely to have much impact on the real world, but I'm generally in favor of fairness and complying with the law.

Trump?  What a joke?  His presence must be strictly for the comic relief he will (no doubt, unwittingly) provide -just by his ridiculous appearance: awful hairpiece &amp; ruddy complexion all.<br/>Trump the chump -everyone's going to be laughing AT him - as in, "what a complete buffoon this guy is! -I can' believe that any serious political debate would include this solipsistic, narcissistic, racist big mouth. He'll make Rand Paul look like Adlai Stevenson by comparison!!!

Is past precedent? Usually ... but not always and not necessarily. There may be parallels between Teump's popularity among Republicans and Bernie Sanders's a!ong Democrats. "Establishment" candidates like Bush3 and Clinton2 represent the continuation of politics as usual, i.e. policies as usual, which collectively have led us into a great swamp, seemingly unable to tackle existential problems like climate change, the rising oligarchy, a growing sense if disenfranchisement and economic uncertainty among many members, or former members, of the middle class.<br/><br/>Perhaps in some vague way, Trump is indeed a version of Howard Beale ("Network") shouting "I'm fed up and I'm not going to take it any more" and, to the surprise of network exexs (played by Nate Cohn in this production) he's finding an audience. Watch "Network " again if you don't remember the denoument.

Breaking news? Sounds more like "broken" to me. <br/><br/>Now John Kasich can proudly crow "I'm Number Ten! I'm Number Ten!" on this ship of fools. As for Chris Christie, he has mercifully escaped from the bus of clowns that might have run over his own "Bridgegate" staff. As for Rick Perry, no more fear of another "oops" moment, perhaps never again on any presidential stage.<br/><br/>Carly Fiorina has a Sisyphean task to become the first woman President in US history. Keep pushing that rock, Carly, from the enviable slot just ahead of George Pataki.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.endthemadnessnow.org" title="www.endthemadnessnow.org" target="_blank">www.endthemadnessnow.org</a>

Any cooking-with-wine advice from fellow Schoolers?<br/>I'm planning a dish to pair with the Floridene, one that calls for 1/2 cup dry white wine. I'm happy splurge for this class's tastings, but a little reluctant to do so for something to boil shellfish in!<br/>Bite the bullet? Try an unopened, cheaper Sauvignon Blanc? Or a just-opened (and little-enjoyed) Loire Viognier? Suggestions? Thanks.

    The article "Chilly at work?  Office formula devised for men" written by Pam Belluck in the main section of the Tuesday August 4th edition of the NY Times was quite interesting from a scientific standpoint.<br/>     The scientific formulas and explanations were very logical, and well explained.  I agree that there is more energy used in the summer with air conditioning turned up to achieve lower temperatures in the office.  Some people may be still be uncomfortable (either too warm or too cold), as one temperature doesn't fit all.<br/>The statement that maintaining a higher temperature in the summer will save energy is true, but if we apply the same logic to the wintertime, when we are using more heat to achieve the same temperatures, the overall cost for the year will balance out.  Whether the thermostat is kept at 70 deg F, or 75 deg F, the overall energy consumption for the year will be similar.  I am surprised that the article left out the winter aspect of the energy equation.<br/>In fact, in the higher latitudes of the US, the winters probably are the predominant factor in the energy equation!

281515
What competing ideas?  All the candidates spout the same cant - only slightly skewed one way or the other.  Compared to other countries, there is barely a scintilla of difference even between the GOP and the Dems.  Bring on Bernie Sanders!

281565
Will we have Trump and Christie insulting each other over their respective toupee and paunch? Will they threaten to get into a fistfight? I guess it's good that Perry won't be there; otherwise he might exercise his concealed-carry rights.<br/><br/>Seriously, the paucity of anything new and interesting out of the clowns who had their warm-up "debate" yesterday makes it obvious that the only interest this televised circus is going to stir depends on what The Donald decides to do. And won't he flummox them all if he puts on a "serious statesman" air? While the audience waits for two hours for the first "You're fired!" eruption?<br/><br/>This is what we get when we reduce the selection of a presidential candidate to a reality show.

Othello was white?! That is interesting indeed. It requires some reinterpretation of the drama/opera. And certainly they should wear modern clothing: period clothing is inconsistent with what we wear today. 

281705
Frank,<br/>Othello not black? Have you read the play?<br/>Iago in Act I: "an old black ram is tupping your white ewe."<br/>Without the poignant inter-racial love, the play loses an enormous part of its social and dramatic power.<br/>Political correctness taken to the absurd extreme!

Marek Edelman, Polish Holocaust survivor/cardiologist who died several years ago? Really! He was Jewish in name only; a socialist and strong Polish nationalist. Applying his "psychology" is a non-starter.

why bother? Here are the main conclusions of the debate: "President Obama has racked up more debt than all Presidents combined." "The government is out of control." "Entitlements must be cut." "Bomb Syria, Iran, Iraq et al."  "Obamacare is Third World socialism."  "The IRS persecutes patriots." The Iran deal will guarantee a nuclear bomb for Iran." "Hillary Clinton caused Benghazi.""Hillary Clinton is a criminal hiding emails." "Global Warming is in God's hands." "Global warming does not exist." "Democrats destroy American jobs ""No more corporate taxes! "Hillary Clinton supports the "callous" selling of baby parts for profit through her operative, Planned Parenthood."

283221
I'm not as interested in which interchangeable candidate made the cut, I'm more interested in the tough, probing questions that will be asked by Fox News, like:<br/>"How soon after your election will you attack Iran?"<br/>"How big will your fence be on the Mexican border?"<br/>"Once you privatize Social Security and Medicare, which Wall Street companies will get to manage the accounts?"<br/>"I know you're not a scientist, but do you agree the land is sinking, since we all agree the oceans are not rising?"<br/>"Once you de-fund PBS, NPR, the Department of Education, and Planned Parenthood, where in the military will you use the money?"<br/>"How much will you cut taxes for those making over $250,000 a year?<br/>"How much money will you allot for rebuilding infrastructure like roads and bridges? Ha ha ha, just kidding, that was a test to see if you were at all concerned for America instead of the billionaires."<br/>I can't wait!

How hard was it for the NYT to move away from the hysteria and publish this OP ED piece? Well I must pay gratitude when due and to the editors of the NYT--Hooray for you!  We in the "civilized" western world continue to get worked up over the killing of a "named" lion and refuse to acknowledge that "Africa" is not Disney World just as the "Whitetail" in Westchester is not Bambi. . Those that make the  argument that photo's tourism will save the animals of africa have no idea the vastness of the continent, the pockets of shear poverty that no photo tourist will ever visit (but a hunter will), the constant erosion of habit due to population growth.   The true imperialist nature lies not with the "White Hunters" but with the misguided, misinformed anti-hunting movement. These individuals want Africa to remain just as it is; They want to tell the population of Africa to leave things alone so that wealthy white children can know of Cecil and take his picture.  Please Africa, don't hunt so that you may have protein in your diet, instead let us Americans decide, over a steak dinner, what is best for you.

The Furgeson effect? Does that include the outright slander and persecution of a cop who was attacked by a 6'4" 285 pound man who just had robbed a store (yes, stealing combined with physical force is called robbery) and according to witnesses and forensic evidence, tried to disarm the arresting officer; twice?<br/>   Or, the shooting of two innocent cops standing in line across a police building (also not mentioned in this article?<br/>    Finally, the alleged abuse of the system. I don't double park, park in forbidden zones or places or run red lights; ever. I don't run up fines because I can't afford to spend frivously, but if I knew I had a judge sympathetic to my race, who would lesson my financial and personal responsibility burden, well maybe I still would respect laws based on common sense and courtesy to my community but I shutter at the consequences anyway. Cops afraid to commit to law enforcement? Look at Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee and many of our large inner cities! Does anyone really believe that what we're experiencing is just 'coincidental' to the 'all the news that's fit to sell' (painfully absent of specific's) hyperbole on this whole matter?

The "how did Burris know where to wait?!" gripe is a bit ridiculous in light of last season's "green eared spaghetti monster - green house paint in a photo from 1992 / 'spaghetti' referencing facial scarring, leading to the scarred killer, who sometimes paints houses for the county" explanation. THAT was some convoluted plotting. Burris could've been waiting outside the only exit to the tunnel, knowing Paul would eventually surface there. Not too difficult, really.

284038
Does it have to be all or nothing?<br/><br/>I thought it was useful for someone who's lived with lions as actual, day-to-day, physical threats to point out to someone like me who's seen them only in zoos that there may in fact be a whole other side to the Cecil story either that we're not hearing or that I'm tuning out. It makes for a more mature appreciation of a situation to have to come to terms with a story's complications--especially is the complications challenge lazy assumptions, like this piece has done for me. Thanks for printing it NYT!

284073
"Which is scarier? This bunch of unqualified folks who think they can be President, or the 47% who think one of them should?"<br/><br/>Exactly!  The numerous references to "clown show" is only relevant to me in the sense that I am afraid of clowns.  I suspect many people using this analogy are "whistling past the graveyard."  Sadly, there are too many Americans who follow their ideology.

Legacy of what?  The only VPs and senators I ever learned about in history class were those to do with the civil war.  Run Joe!

In the notorious words of a US politician: What difference does it make? If the US had not messed around with the Middle East (Iraq, Iran, Yemen), Afghanistan, North Africa (Lybia), the question would not arise. But now you and the world face the consequences of your foolish actions. ISIS formed in 2003/2006 at the height of the Iraquí war (not after,  as FOX wants you to believe) and Al Qaeda has roots that date back to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. The fundamental problem of the US is that it thinks it is better than anyone else (not!) and therefore tells everyone else how to behave by bombing and invading their country. Lately, only Obama tried a different approach. But his efforts may be too late. So live with the outcome of your own foolishness. 

284544
We do? Why? For who?<br/><br/>That's a ridiculous statement. Might as well lock yourself up in your house without electricity (might start a fire!) somewhere there are no earthquakes, hail storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, etc. <br/><br/>I ride horses for fun and would far rather die doing that then lingering in a hospital bed, counting my regrets for playing it safe. 

284786
The real question is: Why does Planned Parenthood receive $500 million in public money every year? I don't mean to single them out, but it's one of many organizations that really should not be a part of government. This happens on both the left and right sides of the political spectrum. Politicians have got to be disciplined by the electorate, and forced to stop spending public money on things that should not be a function of government.<br/><br/>Abortion is widely supported by upper and middle class liberals. Surely they have the resources to establish a private foundation that can fill any gaps in Planned Parenthood's budget. There's no good reason for government to be doing it. Put your money where your beliefs are!

Does anyone -- black or white -- really want to live in a community where the police "rarely pull over anyone anymore" for traffic offenses and even the collection of parking fines is deemed to be too much of an imposition on the poor? Sorry: parking and traffic enforcement is not designed to raise revenues on the back of poor -- it's there to make life safer and more orderly for the public. Well meaning, but dead wrong, journalists in a landmark Manhattan office tower are once again condemning working class folk to devalued lives!

285056
Could I just add one small comment?  I went to a local, well-regarded runners' specialty store for shoes.  I was measured, videoed, etc., and the attendant headed into the back to pile up a selection of choices. "As long as they aren't pink!" I called after him.  He returned with half a dozen pairs of shoes of various makes.  Five of them were pink.  He shrugged apologetically.  "The women's shoes... that's the color they come in."  I bought the turquoise ones.  I mean, really?!  All we "girls" get are PINK?  I am a grown-up woman who is not going to trot around in bubble-gum pink shoes.  Bleccchh.

285195
Really? I saw all of this as Pollyannaism, that this nation is uninformed by choice and outraged that someone burst their bubble and gave them a bad-hair day. This country doesn't want to know anything that will upset them. They react like silly, hand-flapping children: Ooohh, take it away!, whether it is medical fetal tissue or the dead and maimed of our Forever War. 

285281
Try it on and see what's comfortable? That's the result of this intensive study?<br/><br/>I happen to agree with that, by the way; the athlete knows what's best. I just purchased a new pair of sneakers (I'm not a runner however) and the most important thing for me, I've discovered, is plenty of room in the toe box. As much wiggle room as possible. I tend to do distance work, and forefront space is critical for my something neuropathic toes. Good shoes, however, don't need to be 150 bucks to get the job done, IMO.<br/><br/>But that's just me; and by the way, these are different needs than I had about 5-7 years ago. Feet change; the body mechanics change.<br/><br/>I'm with Cheryl - use common sense!

285308
Whilst I immensly dislike the barbaric actions of how this lion was slaughtered - has anyone wondered how easy it was for this lion to be lured out of the park?  With hundreds of thousands of visitors investing in Safari eco-tours each year, these wild animals become accustomed to vehicles (sometimes only 2 meters away from them) and therefore show no fear towards vehicles.  Very easy to strap on some meat to a car and lure an animal when they are not frightened by it!  I get that tourism generates revenue for these countries but poor government management is to blame for over-populating the reserve with tourists. 

285373
The 60s? Uh, that was a while back and I think expectations have changed a bit since them.  By the way, my wife teaches in a public high school where, yes, it is freezing and the temperature is centrally controlled.  We were discussing the original article and she mentioned that one reason they keep it so cold is to encourage the girls to cover up a bit!  How times have changed!

With "friends" like these, who needs enemies? It's all about protecting Hillary -- and for many their investment in Hillary. Go Joe go!!

How many people read Newsweek now?  It's hardly indicative of anything, any more. (It's circulation is down about 100,000, about the number of people living on some NYC city blocks!)<br/><br/>You point may still be well taken, but whether that's due to the press or voter ignorance is hard to say.  And I'd strongly suspect that Biden's name is a LOT more widely recognized now, for both personal reasons and professional accomplishment.<br/><br/>And compare Biden's 29% recognition with some of the numbers some of the "top 10" (or even top 5)  Republican "candidates" would probably poll among general voters!

285417
Legacy?  How about greasing Clarence Thomas' heels into the Supreme Court at the expense of the truth of Anita Hill and others who would have confirmed her,story? Or plagerizing an English politician's remarks which forced Biden to withdraw from one presidential,race? Or the fact that he lost miserably the other primary he entered? Or that he barely makes a blip in polls today? The democrats, who hate ms Rodman Clinton so much, are going to help Jeb! Into the White House.

285433
Biden for president?<br/><br/>Look a it this way: he probably has MORE experience (and laudable experience to anyone but a right-winger) based on 8 years as VP and almost 24 years as a Senator than the SUM TOTAL of ALL the Republican candidates COMBINED!  Think about that for a second!  <br/><br/>There's something to be said fro knowing how to actually govern effecively, not just issue soundbites and generate 'controversy'!<br/><br/>As for experience, how about the below (from Wikipedia), just for starters?<br/><br/>As Vice President, Biden has been involved in Obama's decision-making process and held the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package aimed at counteracting the Great Recession. His ability to negotiate with Congressional Republicans played a key role in bringing about the bipartisan deals that resulted in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 that resolved a taxation deadlock, the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved that year's debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that addressed the impending "fiscal cliff"

@JerryV: Accomplishments? If you visit Mrs. Clinton's campaign website, you'll find them:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/about/bio/" title="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/about/bio/" target="_blank">https://www.hillaryclinton.com/about/bio/</a><br/><br/>But from the tone of your comment, I would guess that you will find this unconvincing.  So tell us since when did the American electorate care about "accomplishments"?  <br/><br/>And what were G.W. Bush's or Barack Obama's "accomplishments" before they were elected? Voters don't seem to care at all!<br/><br/>It's not where you've been, it's where you're going that counts. Hilary Clinton is strong, smart, and compassionate and will lead the country forward rather than back.

285543
He's brash, rich and flouts the establishment (Republican and press) -- if you<br/>re a real American, what's not to like?! He's going a lot farther than anyone dares to predict.

"But does anybody really believe that a woman isn't a person? Or that she's less of a person than an unborn fetus? Or that she's less of a person if she's poor?"<br/>Sadly, yes, there are some who do. They are the ones who listen to Fox News 24/7. who think Rush is a fount of wisdom, who think that God has decreed who shall be poor (and that the fault is in them). They are the people who gloat when a poor black person is shot by a white cop, they are the people who think that Trump is "just like them"; they are the people who cheer when a pol says (in re the lack of health insurance) "Let them die!" They are the ones who elect Congresspersons who enjoy hurting those not like them, and they are the ones who will destroy our country far more effectively than 10,000 AlQaeda suicide bombers.

Where is the author's empirical evidence that these new voting restrictions are not driven by racism? Just saying it's not about racism does not make it so. We know these new restrictions are not about the mythical "voter fraud". If it's not about racism, then what exactly is it about? Maybe there's a new kind of racism afoot, a subset, if you will....Democrats who are minorities. I'm quite sure the GOP did an analysis prior to the passing of these obviously voter-suppressing restrictions to find that these restrictions would, in fact, have a huge impact on Democrats who are minorities. If you don't believe this, all you have to do is watch, again, Mike Turzai from PA saying "Voter ID. Which is going to allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania. Done!".

Where is the feminine outrage? Where is the hurt and anger and frustration of half the American population that is losing ground daily under the onslaught of right wing Christian oligarchs reinstating Jim Crow for Women, pushing them back into the dark ages of the 1950's? Women are the primary targets for these retrogressive conspiracies of the Holy Right, yet there are no massive demonstrations, no marches through the halls of Congress, no demands that each Republican stand up and make their names and views public. The sound of millions of women holding their silence is truly deafening. If 100,000 irate women showed up on Capitol Hill tomorrow with promises to not leave until their health care and birth control clinics are reinstated, there would be action. There would be laws introduced to protect women and girls from the predatory tactics that are now being bandied about without regard to social and medical consequences. The women of America are being shoved into gender subservience and they are simply not resisting nor going noisily. Their shrinking political power is only potential at this point -- when will it finally ignite and start the long fight back for women's independence? If women won't speak up for themselves en mass, who will carry the banner for them? Jane Crow Must Go!

287209
With anonymous friends like these, who needs enemies?!!<br/><br/>"Those supporters... fear that the legacy Mr. Biden has built as an effective partner who took on tough jobs for President Obama, not to mention the deep reservoir of public good will and sympathy he has amassed in his poignant handling of personal tragedies, could be sacrificed in the pursuit of an unsuccessful challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination."<br/><br/>Again the Times is accepting dubious anonymous sources. It is hard to tell if these sources are actually friends and the authors know that for a studied fact or if the authors merely are accepting the word that these people are his friends and have no other agenda.

"A monthly $2,773 pension"?  Gulp!  For six and a half years service???  Whaaaaa?   No?  Really?<br/><br/>A housewife with kids who was never employed outside the home will get, what, like $1500 a month from social security.  (And I would argue, a woman risks her life in childbirth and serves hard-labor far more than any soldier.) But he gets that much?  And he's not even retired! <br/><br/>I'm the first to criticize Republicans for going after pensions for government workers and support fully funding the VA and giving decent pensions to veterans.  And, unlike the other Republican chicken hawks, at least Graham served in the military, but that is an insane amount of pay for a non-combat related pension!  <br/><br/>I've always felt that it's unfair that military and other former government employees should be able to collect a pension before they reach traditional retirement age.  Unless, of course, they are truly disabled.  But if they can work, they should.  But they shouldn't be able to "double-dip" like this. <br/><br/>I'd be interested in finding out what kinds of pensions the other candidates are collecting.  

287318
What veil has been pulled back exactly? The fact that anti-abortion extremists will resort to lying and manipulation! While I agree that abortion shouldn't be hidden from sight, most surgical procedures and the results are gruesome and it's always result in an emotional response unless/until you understand what is being done and why. As to why abortion has had to become more hidden, it's precisely because the anti-abortion movement has a history of irrationality and violence in pursuit of policies that would result in the oppositie of what they claim to want i.e. making abortions illegal would result in more abortions. So it's crazy and mainly about a powerful appeal to emotions and not what would reduce abortions.

287517
Hitting them with the police car?!?  Not waited in in a timely manner?!?<br/><br/>This is not progressivism, or leftism, or anti-racism, or even humanism.  This is infantile narcissism looking for stories to tell itself.

Finally, what took the NY Times a month to come out with intelligent coverage and perspective on this idiotic madness over a lion in Zimbabwe? The outrage should be on the human rights issues in Zimbabwe where nearly 25% of the people have left the country.<br/>This is simply another social media hype that shows how shallow the people of America really are. Where is the true continued concern over last year’s social outrage “Bring back our girls”? That was April 15, 2014 in northern Nigeria. The girls were kidnapped by an extremist Muslim group called Boko Haram, whose name in the Hausa language means “Western education is a sin.”<br/> The girls are still gone but this year’s “outrage” is about a lion? All from people that most likely cannot even find Africa on a map much less Zimbabwe or Nigeria and have no idea of their history, culture, or true concerns. Thank you Mr. Nzou even if the readers still cannot comprehend what you are trying to say!

287803
What planet on you on? Pregnancy can make a women very sick and it can kill her as well. The U.S. has the highest mortality rate vs any other industrialized country. Secondly- Planned Parenthood doesn't sell "baby parts". It is fetal tissue. There is no "baby"- it is a potential baby.  Thirdly- your tax dollars do NOT go to the abortion side of Planned Parenthood which is only 3 percent of their business. If you believe that it does, then I have a bridge to sell you!

287923
You know what else is dangerous? Moose and avalanches! When I go to my home in the mountains, I am sometimes accosted by a giant moose, who would undoubtedly charge and kill any human it could. I am also a backcountry skier, and had one of my friends taken from me, when something triggered an avalanche where we were skiing! You will be glad to know that I didn't go buy a shotgun, kill the moose, and hang its head over my fireplace. I also still go out back skiing in the mountains! The point is that we (as humans) are the ones that are encroaching on nature and we cannot complain if occasionally nature pushes back! I am quite certain that the number of lions killed in Zimbabwe over the course of time is unlikely proportional to the occasional human killed by a lion, who was probably living right on the border of or in the lion's territory! So Mr. Nzou, I am still so sorry about Cecil!

Let me give a free advise to Obama, FBI and CIA; about who is the most cruel militants, whether ISIS or Al-Qaeda? and how to minimize our losses spending more than 20 billion dollars!!!<br/>Our worst enemy is the ideology of the ISIS and Al-Qaeda preachers; who are following the dictates of the Saudi, Jordanian, Kuwaiti religious heads, and the second the millions of dollars being siphoned by these oil reach nations to breed such Jihadis. The third, and the most important point is our obsession with Iran, who in fact is the solo player in the entire world to abate this menace just for their own survivor. Rather than billions of dollars money for drone killings and other military means and allowing the Jihadis to breed more Jihadis; we must use our power of diplomacy to force the Arab Oils kings to stop spreading of Jihadi ideology; stop funding these Jihadis and make peace with Iran stopping hatred for Shias and others who are not following their Wahabism. 

288135
Who voted for these opportunistic, bigoted senators?  Did their constituents study their records and vote accordingly?  Do said constituents even know the names of their representatives in Congress? Or do they not vote out of the same disgust that we all feel about Congress.

NO PROOF?  There have been 53 killings by police in England and Wales in 24 YEARS.  In the first 24 DAYS of 2015 there were 59!  Does THAT not tell you that SOMETHING SERIOUS IS WRONG with America?  Perhaps it doesn't phase you at all and THAT is PRECISELY my point.

Actual facts?!  How about forensic evidence, DNA evidence, multiple autopsies, eyewitness accounts, all carefully reviewed by the DA as well as the Justice Dept, and all concluded the same thing:  The officer did not violate anyone's civil rights, he used force appropriately, and reported the incident accurately.  It's tme to take off the tinfoil hat!

"So why is Trump regarded as ludicrous, while Bush and Walker are serious?"<br/><br/>The short answer is that Walker, more so than Bush, can be controlled. Remember that prank call from a radio station? Jeb can also be controlled, though to a lesser extent.<br/><br/>Trump is a loose cannon. Oligarchs just don't like that. As for him making sense in some ways, it is undeniable he does, insofar as guarding his plutocratic interests. As they say in French, "pas folle, la guepe!"

Why are these State Legislators so concerned with how they’re perceived nationally?  Why this fear of being “flyover country” and this blind desire to draw existing businesses to Kansas rather than inciting creative, intelligent entrepreneurship from within? Many people in Kansas don’t worry about being “flyover country” because anyone who ignores Kansas is missing true beauty. Others’ ignorance is just that.  Let confidence - not fear - inspire growth.  Of course that confidence must depend on intelligent citizens, which, well, you know the socialist system on which that depends. <br/><br/>One glaring omission in this article is the devastating effect this increase in sales taxes – implemented to recover the shortfalls from the cuts in income taxes – has on poor Kansans.  There are urban Kansans! There are ethnic minorities in Kansas! They are disproportionately affected by these policies, these blithely ignorant policies, made to impress some imaginary conservative gods… Also, how do you write an article about Kansas government and not mention the Koch brothers?

The thermostat has such power, have not all us older workers, seen it locked down under protective plastic covers?  I enjoy the signs over the thermostats telling us not to change the setting.<br/><br/>All the fun office events that happen when a coworker is either freezing or baking!  <br/><br/>The coworker who ignored instructions and plugged that space heater into the office panel system.  She fried all the computer equipment, the panel system but only took out a few workstations. <br/><br/>The very warm gal that opened windows all winter.  Just walk quickly past the below zero temps blowing out her office door, never agreed to meet in her office and be glad your desk was not near her.  <br/><br/>The CEO working out in the office gym with a locked, covered thermostat, set far too high for a gym.  A very direct business man, he just smashed the cover and set the thermostat to a correct level for a gym.  All the very sweaty workers using the gym, were very grateful.  After all complaints to maintenance had gone unanswered, the CEO was the talk of the week.<br/><br/>I admit to always calling maintenance.  You may find, you’re right, your office has no a/c, since the duct was never connected in the crawl space.  Unlucky, enough to be sitting underneath the a/c vent in the ceiling pumping in artic air?  I learned the vent could be closed off partially or completely.  Or found, it was wide open, I was at the end of the line for a/c distribution, so get use to sweating, dress lightly and buy a big desk fan.

"don't people work their butts off to get better cars, better clothes, better health care and better houses in better neighborhoods?"<br/><br/>karystrance's incisive mind has pierced to the heart of the matter! Unless they continue to live in impoverished neighborhoods, what is there to motivate the poor to work their butts off to get better cars, better clothes, better health care, and better houses in better neighborhoods, as karystrance clearly has? Even a stereotypical bleeding-heart liberal like him is sufficiently right-thinking to see the fallacy of forcing the poor not to live in poverty! Why, that simply takes away their motivation to "move on up" through their own bootstrap efforts, in the manner, of e.g. Bill Gates, who was born rich, yet, somehow, became even richer, despite the fact that being born into wealth disincentivates efforts to raise oneself out of the muck of poverty that being born into poverty provides.

"What's The Buzz About Wild Bees?"<br/>As soon as I saw a headline about bees I knew I had to read this article. I have been concerned with the recent news of bees for some time now but I hadn't seen much information on how to save them. I'm sure many of you have seen the saying "Save the Bees!"—which has been rapidly growing in popularity—but do you know how to save them? Like myself, many people are concerned for the bee population but aren't aware what solutions are available for this problem. This article, and the video that accompanies it, has opened my eyes to why the bee population is falling and what can be done to protect them. The main issue is that we are using bees as a product to pollinate one large group of plants at a time instead of allowing them to get the variety of pollen they need year round. The simple solution to this is to have fields of varied crops—as opposed to having thousands of acres of one plant at a time. In addition to that, we need to stop importing honey bees and allow the native bee species to pollinate the crops. These two things together will create a huge impact on the future of bee populations. The only thing standing in the way of this simple change to our farming techniques is the capitalistic routine that is already in place. It's convenient for large companies to ship in all the bees they want to farm however many acres of the same crop they desire; we can save the bees but we have to take action to change the farming industry.

Do anti-choice people EVER listen? Do they EVER read news they don't agree with? Personally Responsible -- The tax money given to Planned Parenthood is NOT used for abortion, but for other health services. How often does that have to be stated for it to penetrate intentionally thick heads? I am so tired of stupidity and of those who want to dictate the lives of others. What hypocrisy! Make women bear children they don't want, and then doom many of those children to unhappy early lives in foster homes and worse. Intense interest in a fetus in someone else's womb -- no interest in the child when born!

"Where Should a Poor Family Live?"<br/><br/>Mr. Edsall cannot be serious! The question answers itself: a poor family should live wherever it can afford to live, as long as it's not in *my* neighborhood.

290249
Reading the comments on "Where Should a Poor Family Live?" one gets the feeling that in America:<br/>1. It's a crime being poor.<br/>2. Poverty is equivalent to a disease, so the "anywhere but in my neighborhood!" kind of caveat.<br/>3. The poor are subjects of other people's--the non-poor--discourses.<br/>4. The poor are subhuman or somewhat non-human.<br/>5. The poor is an anonymous mass of faceless people, mostly non-whites and mostly, Black, Hispanics and Asians (although Asians would resent being clubbed together with the first two).<br/>6. The rich are rich because they have grasped the magical formula of "success" and part of the formula is some din about "hard work."<br/>7. The poor are poor because they are dumbasses.<br/>8. Poverty is so feared that people don't even want to talk about how it happens.

When will there be justice for Darren Wilson? He was completely exonerated by a state grand jury and federal investigation. Due to the lies told about him, including the "hands up don't shoot" lie, he lost his career, received numerous death threats and has been forced to live in near isolation. All this for doing his job and protecting himself from a criminal who wanted to do him harm. Shame!

So, the neo-cons want more concessions from the Iranians? Well, that means the our side has to also be willing to make concessions, since that is the nature of negotiations and diplomacy. Of course the problem is the hardliners never had any intentions of negotiating, just demanding and threatening to get the one-sided result they demand. What a mean-spirited and arrogance position! With all due respect to Israel, the world does not revolve around them, and every time Netanyahu goes chest-to-chest with Obama, he loses - as he will this time.

Why is the rule allowing statistical sampling when a company knows to the penny the salary of all employees? Are we common citizens presumed not understand a simple division?

Either the Iran deal OR some sort of war?  Wake up everyone, the Iran deal is going to be the war.<br/><br/>Here we have a deal to release $150B in funds to Iran while lifting the restrictions on them buying ballistic missiles, and meanwhile the US is arming Iran's sworn enemies/next door neighbors, Israel and Saudi Arabia, to the teeth...and this is a deal to avoid a war?  <br/><br/>If you are unaware...the OBAMA ADMINISTRATION proposed the largest weapons deal IN US HISTORY with Saudi Arabia. Worth $60 billion, the deal includes up to 84 new F-15 warplanes and upgrades to 70 more, 70 Apache attack helicopters, 72 Black Hawks, and 36 Little Bird helicopters! And just last week, to grease the wheels on the Iran deal, the US State Department approved the sale of 600 Patriot missiles (600 !!!), worth $5.4 billion, to Saudi Arabia. You can be sure at least 599 of those will be pointed directly at Iran just around the time that Iran is able to buy its missiles under the deal the Obama administration is pushing so hard today.  <br/><br/>The support the US gives to Israel's military need not be repeated here.  <br/><br/>Can you say tinderbox?  <br/><br/>Do people really think there is any chance that what is unfolding here is not an absolute path to all out war in the Middle East? And by the way, if you think the US will be sitting that one out, you're equally out of touch.  <br/><br/>The only people who love this deal are President Obama, who gets a (short term) foreign policy legacy, and Northrop Grumman Corporation.

Hundreds of miles away? Please provide some examples! Texas has a large geography but also a large population.

Perhaps however, some people just find it inconvenient to get an ID for anything but something they want or value like healthcare, rent assistance, the right to drive a car, a way to cash checks.

Iran wants to implement peaceful applications of nuclear energy?  Do you really believe that? Were that so, there'd have been no concern about their development of reactors and their enrichment and no deal would have ever have been needed to negotiate!<br/>I am astounded by the naiveté of those who argue for a deal, any deal, at any cost.<br/>Iran has proven to be only interested in hegemony in the Middle East and has adopted aggressive policies counter to any kind of stability and counter to almost all American interests.<br/>Sorry, but I do not trust them one lick. The issue is really are we better off enriching them with lifting the sanctions, or keeping the screws to them until they renounce violence, renounce their ever constant proclamations to eradicate Israel.

"Sarcastic Critic of Politics and Media"?<br/><br/>Maybe the headline writer should some reading (including the dictionary) to understands the difference between "sarcasm" and "satire"?  Satire (or irony) is NOT the same as "sarcasm" (in part because the goal of satire is to both amuse and educate, while sarcasm is basically negative and corrosive)!  Kind of an English 101 distinction!<br/><br/>And who wrote the caption headline "using a fake news format, Jon Stewart was equally trusted and distrusted, polls showed, and viewer numbers fell in recent years"?  <br/><br/>1) Again, English matters!<br/>"Fake" is meant to deceive, while parody is playing with with the gere, in this case news.  I seriously doubt is any sentient person thought Jon Stewart was offering a "fake news format"--that's was all part of the comedy (Maybe you're confusing Comedy Central with Fox -- aka Faux" -- News?)<br/>2) "Distrusted"?<br/>By WHOM?  A lot of us trust Jon a lot more than media news to be reveal the truth, even is by comedy and humor!<br/>3) "Viewer numbers fell in recent years"?<br/>Then how has Stewart's statue as a political commentator (and a reliable one!) steadily risen?  And WHY is is departure such big news, and cause of consternation to so many?  And oh yeah, could it be that a lot of people are watching Jon -- and many others -- on the web?  (You know the medium, the Times is so desperately seeking to use in stead of traditional print?)   Ratings are so...1985, anyway!<br/><br/>The Times really disappoints--sadly, again...

294241
Now that Colbert and Stewart are gone, who will ever talk about books on a tv show that people watch? That is what I'm most going to miss. (by the way, anyone who thinks the Times is read by 'liberals' should read some of these comments! Fox infiltrators? Ha ha)

Where are the solutions from the right wing lying hypocrites?????  You know, the jerks whose job it inexplicably ACTUALLY IS to come up with solution!!!!!!

Is it actual, bonafide voter fraud?  No, it's not.  Is it the fear that people who are not supposed to vote will vote?  How do you think this happens when you must first Register and to do so must be a US citizen?<br/>No, this is very clearly an attempt to IMPEDE votes, folks.  And if you cannot see this, I'm afraid you aren't looking at it with critical thought.

Wow, part of this reads like a puff piece for Fox news --  beloved by their conservative base as a way to counteract liberal bias, known for their hard-hitting questions (?!?) -- then, nothing about the reality of Fox News, and Roger Ailes, and their blatant working hand-in-glove with the Republican party, their introducing of distortion into news coverage, etc. Did the reporter pay too great a price for this unlimited "access" to debate preps?

Gee, how did I know that the NYT would love this speech even before I read the article?  This is the same NYT which barely noted the rally of 12,000  protesters attended by world recognized figures in Times square in the middle of rush hour - not newsworthy enough for them.   So Obama accuses the republican opposition to this capitulation as being in line with those screaming "death to America" in Iran.  Wow.... how appalling!!!!   The reason this capitulation to Iran is so bad is because it basically takes any serious enforcement off the table.  Iran knows... as do all of us that military action will NEVER be taken by the US.   I am not a war monger who thinks war will solve anything, but certainly reassuring your enemies that they have nothing to fear is not the way to influence them.  Obama shows his hand to easily...and it is a hand full of Jokers.  Discussions about the Iraq war are irrelevant.   I know Bush was a boob... I thought so then and I thought so now.  Possibly he was even a war criminal.   Netanyahu may have supported the war idea at the time as well.  But is that relevant to the status of a different enemy, with different stated aims, and actual evidence of their desire to harm us and our allies (yes friends, Israel is still an ally)?  So if Obama wants to reassure us about the quality of this arrangement, he best do it by reviewing the merits of the agreement and not by simply spouting his fear of military engagement and insulting those with rational doubts.

How corrupt is journalism, the NYT, and its editors?<br/><br/>This passes for objective journalism under the corrupt regime:<br/><br/>"But Mr. Stewart was far from a universally loved figure. His viewership, though a boon for Comedy Central, was much smaller than that of the network late-night shows. A Pew Research poll said there were nearly as many viewers who distrusted it as those who trusted it, and there was a significant divide among the liberals who craved it and conservatives who loathed it. Critics, even on the left, said he could come off as pompous and self-righteous."<br/><br/>You criticized him. How even handed of you! And, your conservative unnamed sources got their shots in. How businesslike of you.<br/><br/>Faithless hacks.

How are your elections conducted in Idaho?  Here in IL, they have lists of residents registered to vote in that district.  You walk in, give your name and address, and are handed your ballot.  I couldn't possibly go to a different polling place--my name wouldn't be on the list of registered voters!  How many people are going to know/memorize someone else's name in another district for the purpose of casting another vote?  Most people are too worried about getting their pay docked just because they took time out to cast their one legitimate vote.  Most ridiculous theory I've ever heard.

But has anyone analyzed why majority of Americans believe counter to their own economic interests? Simple answer is that they have been brain washed by a powerful rich minority. They know exactly how to manipulate their opinions. Remember the simple phrases like - "death panels", "death taxes", "jack-booted government enforcers" and then fear mongering like- "take away your bibles and guns", and so on - that doesn't leave much room for rational discussions!

Why characterize The Daily Show as "fake news"?  They may have exaggerated for effect, or posed facetiously "fake real" questions in order to get subjects talking on tape, and they had goofy graphics and crude catchphrases.  But Stewart himself offered real opinion on real newsmakers, elected officials and policies.  The humor came from the stupendous hypocrisy that generally accompanied...well everything in the Bush Administration, and plenty of Obama's too.  Using real clips of cable news blowhards, edited in such a way as to point out their uselessness to informing the electorate, isn't "fake."  It's showing how the emperor (or sometimes this very paper!) has no clothes.

What are the options?  Let's take a look:<br/><br/>1.  Without the deal, Iran returns to their currently paused program and will have nuclear capabilities in a matter of months.<br/>2.  If we maintain or increase sanctions, we will go it alone.  Our partners (in the deal) have already  sent representatives to to re-start trading with Iran.  Unilateral sanctions on our part will merely shift trade from U. S. corporations to our "allies".<br/>3.  A military attack on Iran's nuclear sites merely pushed it back:  two-to-three years if by Israel, and four-to-five years by the U.S.  This deal puts it back ten-to-fifteen years.  Israel already has--but doesn't admit--much more nuclear firepower than Iran anyway.  <br/><br/>It's not a perfect deal; but, it is the best of several bad options and, perhaps doing nothing would be the worst of the worst.  Two former Israeli Intelligence chiefs have said that Netanyahu is wrong, and that a U. S. departure from it would leave Israel as the loser.<br/><br/>Politically, Netanyahu is merely fanning the flames of the War-Hawks in the Likud Party.  And, the GOP is kissing-up to Israel to gain political ground and continue to obstruct Obama.<br/><br/>So what do they care if they are allowing Politics to trump (no pun intended) National Security, huh!<br/><br/><a href="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="http://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">http://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a>

How about we go after America's food corporations?  They make food that is nutritionally worthless and just adds empty calories.  They know it and they market it - especially to kids.  Want chocolate cereal for breakfast?  You got it!  Ugh.<br/><br/>I read once where these food execs all get together to set prices.  They sell us junk at exorbitant prices and then we ask why America is so fat and poor.  How about we look at these corporations and what they're selling us, eh?

Mitch McConnell thinks this goes way over the top of public discourse?  This coming from a "Representative" who invites Netanyahu to set our discourse?<br/><br/> Despite the GOP mantra, war has gotten us into the vicious cycle of terrorism and war.  It's time to give peace a chance!

JABarry - "What universe do Republicans live in?"<br/><br/>Might be that same universe where "some" on these pages blamed the entire meltdown of Cuba's economy on the US embargo. I guess if the US embargo of Cuba made such a drastic change by itself, since every other county in the world traded with Cuba, than a US embargo of IRAN would have the same result. In that universe.<br/><br/>You can't switch back and forth between universes and retain credibility!

Diversity?  With two exceptions, middle aged white guys.<br/><br/>Diversity of thought?  Surely you jest.<br/><br/>Every single one of those candidates has the same opinion on every issue.  To remind:<br/><br/>Obamacare:  Bad.  Repeal on day one.<br/>Iran Agreement:  Bad.  Bomb Iran on day one.<br/>Same sex marriage:  Bad.  Will destroy America.<br/>Supreme Court:  Good, except on issues we disagree with.<br/>Abortion:  Opposed.<br/>Israel:  Good.<br/>Gun Control:  Yeah, right!<br/>Benghazi:  Say no more.<br/>Obama:  Worst president ever.  And maybe not even American.  Certainly not a Christian.<br/>Hillary:  Bad<br/>Sanders:  Communist.<br/>Immigrants, aka Mexican rapists:  Bad.<br/>Bill:  Philanderer, murderer.

What can be done? Help everyone get an ID! They're useful for other reasons in life too. I find it odd that picking up a package from FedEx or UPS has more stringent requirements than voting. <br/><br/>Is the TSA racist as well for requiring an ID to fly?

Anyone who is delusional enough to believe that removing Saddam has held Iran  "in check"? should think critically instead of dogmatically!! The only two parties that benefited from the US invasion were the Mullahs in Tehran and the fundamentai Zionists in Jerusalem-Netanyahu's ilk in the Likud there and his chicken hawk counterparts here in the US congress-ie. Graham, Huckabee, Schumer, McConnell et al: The Shia led government in Baghdad is kissing cousins with their Persian counterparts in Tehran-US lives and $ propped up Al Maliki's government there for years while marginalizing the Sunnis who gravitated towards militancy because they were either ignored by the US or denied a voice by the Shia led Baghdad government. What would you call that: a "A Catastrophic Success" as stated by the last Bush???? Let the aforementioned chicken hawks place their progeny's lives on the line-oh, wait a minute isn't that the one thing these pathetic cowards don't do when it comes to walking the walk???

Why can't we have both?<br/><br/>Tubman on the $20, Roosevelt on the $10! It's about time.  What is this "pick one, because we can only change one" mentality?  And it's a good point that great as she was, Eleanor Roosevelt did not have as harsh a path as Harriet Tubman, who was born a slave.  About time someone born a slave received this honor. Tubman's the perfect choice. <br/><br/>Also, the next time we decide to choose someone to put on our currency, I'd like to see Frederick Douglass considered.

297412
Can we please take Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill?!  Why remove Hamilton from the $20? He is the father of the Federal Reserve Banking system and, I would say, one of the five most influential figures in our history to serve in the fderal government.  <br/><br/>The woman who should replace Andrew Jackson should be Harriet Tubman. We need to recognize the role of women and we need to recognize the role of heroic African-Americans. I remember so clearly reading a book about Harriet Tubman in the first grade. I was astonished that a person would risk her life over and over again to help fellow slaves travel north to freedom. She was smart, brave and a leader.  Her quiet courage in the face of the peculiar institution is all the more impressive when you compare Ms. Tubman to some of the bombast in American political life today.

Declining audience? Does John Koblin even know how viewers actually view these days, or how Nielsen data is and isn't measured? Does he know how many people have "cut the cord" from cable, and watch Stewart and much else via streaming, apps, and other online/mobile, non-TV, methods? Did he bother looking into any of this? More people actually watch Stewart through these means, I bet, than through the "audience/viewer/Nielsen", 20th-century "figures" that Koblin cites.<br/>NYT, please try to report on today's reality when you write paragraphs like this, instead of relegating the above facts to just "Viacom's view"! Small wonder the NYT is dying a slow death....

Nick Kristof, human rights dilettante, or Amnesty International, who have investigated this issue for years around the world, and courageously come to the same conclusions as many other human rights and public health organizations?<br/><br/>Yes readers, it is a real human rights issue. And Kristof is on the wrong side. Read the actual AI proposal. Listen to what sex workers have to say. The criminalization models, no matter whether the most draconian US or "Nordic" version, fail. Instead these promote the very things they are supposedly constructed to combat, and instead create institutionalized violence against the most marginalized members of society. <br/><br/>Think how many years we institutionalized violence against gay and lesbian members of society (and still do!)? This issue reflects the same kinds of prejudice and ignorance. Can we ever learn our lessons?

Are there also signs that the Times' best days are behind it?<br/><br/>Didn't it have a print circulation of 1.1 million in 2004 that dropped to 900K in by 2010 and was down to 650K (M-F) in 2014?<br/><br/>Should one question the significance of an institution based on a statistic that reflects a change in viewing habits (and ignores online viewers) more than anything else - such as content and impact?<br/><br/>Jon's passionate outrage at the state of affairs in VA, 9/11 responders bill, race relations, and media hypocrisy made him a powerful voice - not simply for the content (for which his writers and researchers deserve tremendous credit), but for the fact that his viewers could discern that the outrage and humanity was real (as opposed to fox, pun intended). Jon was able to connect with his viewers and re-assure them of human decency.<br/><br/>Did he have a liberal bias? Of course. He made no pretense of hiding that. But, did that prevent him from calling out President Obama, Kathleen Sebelius, Nancy Pelosi, or Harry Reid, when he disagreed with them? Certainly not.<br/><br/>His contributions and legacy deserves better acknowledgment from the New York Times than this 'piece', which doesn't do him justice. <br/><br/>Thank you, Jon for all the memories! We will miss you!

So Obama wanted Federal contractors and subcontractors to provide details about political contributions?!  But then backed down.  Seems like there is no end to the loss of freedoms US citizens are subjected to.  But for a President to even think they have the right to ask about political donations from companies that do business with the Fed is an outrage of huge proportion. <br/><br/>Obama must be stopped.  He is not doing his job.  And for those that believe the President just gets to make executive orders (or 'mandates' to avoid the statistics around his dictatorship) about everything and anything he chooses is treasonous.  What is wrong with this arrogant man that believes he can do whatever he wants in a country where his only job is to uphold existing laws - all of them?

Maybe Alaska can secede and PR move in in its place?  Better yet, Texas!

Do you want to eliminate sex trafficking?  Legalize prostitution and regulate it.  Last time I looked, sex trafficking wasn't a big problem in Nevada, and credit cards are accepted too!  No need for pimps either.  Hopefully, men who can legally pay for sex with an 21 year old, will not find the need to pay for sex with a 15 year old, but for the men who do, and the pimps who traffic in these underage girls, no punishment is too severe.

To Wolfram, Columbia: So, what? Maybe the group that drinks is not the entire group that wants to vote - maybe not even part of that group. I almost never go to a liquor store, yet I vote in every election. If you want to do a study that reveals an actual truth about voting rights, you have a long way to go!

“There’s a shameful lack of male therapists”?! Why don’t you address the MEN,who are passing over these fields for more lucrative fields? It was not long ago that nearly ALL therapists were male,at which time. the suicide rate was just as high among males.<br/>   The reason that fewer men are becoming therapists,is because of low reimbursement  rates.No one is “KEEPING MEN out of the mental health and<br/>education fields.” Men are choosing not to enter these fields because they don’t consider them lucrative.<br/>   How exactly are “women’s sexist pre-conceptions and control agendas keeping men out of the mental health and education fields and preventing men from seeking help.”? How did my male psychologist make it past this sexist minefield  to earn his doctor in psychology?How did all the other male psychologists and psychiatrists  I know make it past these agendas?I’ll have to ask them.<br/>  A “Glass Cellar?” Seriously?Take a good look at Congress and tell me all about the “Glass Cellar”that is occupied by men.How many Forbes 500 companies have women as CEOs?

Kevin, you ask a most fundamental question (one that I always ask myself when incidents like this occur): "Can anyone honestly say that if Micheal Brown were white, the fatal encounter with Officer Wilson would have ended the same way?"<br/><br/>My answer: absolutely positively YES!  I sincerely believe that, under this set of circumstances, had Michael Brown been white, asian, hispanic et cetera and the officer were non-white, we'd likely see the same tragic results unfold.  Sad but true.<br/><br/>I've followed this story with particular interest including studying the ME report and the sequence of the shots that Officer Wilson fired and have concluded that Brown was a bully looking for trouble and, unfortunately for him, found it.  He should not be the poster child for police racism and excess.  Tamir Rice is a much better choice for this dialogue.

298449
Geryymandering? C'mon, you are bringing up the Democrat party's tried and true method of dominating the voters??? You do realize it is named after a Massachusetts governor?<br/><br/>First off, until 1965 states had "at-large" representatives. Those were made illegal. Secondly the 1965 REQUIRES states to gerrymander a majority-minority district, if possible. That is the law!!!<br/><br/>And you mention Gerrymandering. Blame the Democrats who invented it and then codified it in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

"Facts getting in the way?"  What a myopic view of world history!  What country has the greatest nuclear stockpile?  Which is the only country ever to detonate nuclear bombs?  Which country has initiated invasions in the MIddle East in the last decade?<br/><br/>When was the last time Iran started a war?<br/><br/>What country rescued the corrupt Shah when he was about to be captured?  What country, in league with Great Britain, arranged for the overthrow of Mossadegh, likely the best chance for democracy ever to take root in the Middle East (because of oil interests, of course).  What country shot down an Iranian commercial airliner in an unprovoked attack?  And you question why we should trust the Iranians?  <br/><br/>As for health care, well over 90% of enrollees have been able to keep their doctor.  A majority of both doctors &amp; insurance companies like the system.  And millions of Americans who had to sit in emergency rooms (for which our taxes pay anyway) now can actually schedule appointments with a doctor who can focus on them.

What if they don't graduate? That would certainly limit the vote, especially if a certain party made graduation harder and harder - like a voter literacy requirement.<br/><br/>Instead, issue an automatic voter ID to everyone born here at age 18.  And every naturalized citizen upon naturalization.  Free of course!

I'm curious how you see this as any different than the established political puppets already on the stage? Just how well has our current president been able to work with congress - be honest with yourself - he threatens to veto everything that does not go his way! Your dictator is in office now. Has he done some good things - SURE, but he has created the largest racial divide and income inequality gap ever in history in my opinion. I am not supporting Trump currently, but I'm sure as hell glad he's not afraid to raise the issues everyone is so worried about being "politically correct" about. It's not about being a supporter of the constitution, It's about someone just telling it how it is without towing the party line! I find it a whole lot more puzzling how democrats can support Hillary! Where do you even start with that life of deception.....

299256
This is a rather vague comment - can you expand upon what it is that 'appalled' you about the emergence of Corbyn?<br/><br/>For me, it is a tremendous breath of fresh air that a man of authenticity and compassion, who is prepared to face down economic myths rather than pander to them, has emerged as a potential leader of the opposition. <br/><br/>He has reinvigorated the moribund Labour left. No longer will triangulation and focus groups overcome anything resembling genuine principled policy. #corbyn4leader!

299286
Surely you're joking? When the Repubs decide to deny Obama any success (talk about a classical case of 'cutting off your nose to spite your face'! in this case, being willing to destroy the country in order to defeat the President!), you can hardly blame Obama for the results.<br/>It's a very bad joke.

Are there fairies and pixie dust in the make believe land you live in?   You either purposefully tell lies and falsehoods in an attempt to re-write history or you live in a fantasy land filled with MSM lollipops and cotton candy. <br/><br/>Eric Cantor met with Obama 3 days into his presidency and made overtures in an attempt to work together.  Obama told Cantor "Elections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won".  This one sentence sums up Obama's willingness to work with Republican's on anything.  <br/><br/>Harry Reid continually filled the amendment tree and blocked Republican's ability to offer amendments to any bills.  Republicans were left with no choice but to filibuster so Reid invokes the nuclear option and changes the Senate rules on filibuster!<br/><br/>Obama did not come into office to lead through building partnerships as you suggest.  He came to RULE and impose his ideological will.

To the author:  "strong evidence from a variety of sources that people who have health insurance spend more on medical care than people who don’t"?  You absolutely have to be kidding! The purpose of health care is not primarily to save money, it's to save people. It was never intended to be free.

How can one be free if one's basic needs are not fulfilled? Americans seem to believe that a libertarian ideology of freedom at all costs is great. Europeans like individual freedom also. But, they understand that the main role of the state is to prevent social predators to exploit their fellow citizens. Sometimes, the state is too large as in France. But, the French feel free. Notice, how often they protest in the streets against anything they dislike! It does not happen in the US. While the European model is more equality based than the US, it still has not solved the unacceptable problem of inequality of opportunities. Minorities suffer from discrimination in Europe also. But, overall the European social-democratic system works better for the average family than the US model. Many Americans do not know much about the world outside their borders. They suffer from a terminal social disease, the arrogance of ignorance. Having lived and worked on both sides of the "pond", I think that European's quality of life is way higher than the US one. Life is not about acquiring material goods (often imported junk). It is about enjoying what one has. To experience a quality life, freedom from the fear of poverty must be more or less achieved. A civilized, democratic state should provide it to its citizens.      

300298
A cloak of civility is correct, is there a European country in which one can even imagine a person of color being elected to the highest office in the land? (many have been around far far  longer than the USA) Can you think of Any European country that would automatically confer citizenship to the immigrant child of a poor mother giving that child an opportunity to change his/her fortune in life? (many of us, including some of our billionaires,  got their first lucky break by benefitting from this generous American constitutional guarantee!) America (still) has many wonderful qualities<br/>It's the amazing rise in  inequality that has eaten up American's original virtue, that  if you work hard, the state will be there to help you succeed no matter who your mother or father was, this country used to guarantee that right by govt heavily subsidizing education and limiting corporate interference in politics.  It doesn't do that anymore (gerrymandering, citizens united, unfettered lobbying etc) America used to be a  stark contrast to Europe's more class based society where upward mobility was   limited if you weren't born into the right family; in my view, we've become less American that way and more European, we're turning into societies our ancestors attempted to escape.

Gracious, wmar - you try to quote Heartland's junk and still can't point to the original?<br/><br/>And why is it that the do-nothings and denier groups have to constantly try to adopt such confusingly-similar names when presenting their junk to the public?  Can't they come up with their own original names when presenting anti-regulation PR work?<br/><br/>I'm sure they're not trying to intentionally mislead...<br/><br/>There's the IPCC, with active researchers the world over donating a considerable amount of their time to produce serious reviews of all the climate science.<br/><br/>So Heartland dogs up a NIPCC and pays a few scientists to assemble a comedy sketch you referred to here, with the "CO2 is Plant Food!" trademarked tagline.<br/><br/>The Copenhagen Accord is signed - a fairly toothless international agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions.  Suddenly we have Bjorn with his Copenhagen Consensus, who comes up with game-show like competitions that are basically "what problems of the world will we solve with this much money" and the gag answer at the end is "sorry, climate, you were -that- close to making the list this time".  Cue laugh track as the well-paid host gives the trademark fake-rueful grin.<br/><br/>Aerial fertilizer indeed.

Have you ever served on a jury? I have, a murder case. I had to swear to tell the truth during questioning. When you swear to tell the truth under oath, you can be prosecuted if they discover you were lying. I am not in favor of the death penalty, but I did NOT want to be on this jury. I did not lie when questioned by the prosecutor, he put me on the jury anyway. After sitting through the trial, I was one of the alternates picked at random to be dismissed before deliberations. One of the jurors not dismissed was an elderly woman who slept through half of the trial!

So needing an ID to buy beer is also a conspiracy to deny minorities rights, in this case, the right to buy beer? Those racist convenience stores! Democracies around the world require IDs, but in the U.S., where the Left has officially gone bonkers, it's a racist conspiracy! Let's just scrap IDs and go on the honor system, and while we're at it, open the borders to anyone who wants to come in and send white cops to reeducation camps.

DT: In what society are horrible crimes *not* committed? This is a click-bait story for New York Times online to sell advertisement, because they can print the word "Israel" in the headline, not real news. People see "Israel" and "death" in the headline, their old anti-Semitic feelings get riled up, and they come running. Viola, next thing you know: Advertising dollars for the New York Times!

How many Palestinians were evicted in recent memory from their homes and/or killed when Israel was created? The term "never again" is still frequently used by Israel to justify it's actions.<br/>Israel used to be one of the most admired countries in the world.<br/>A real underdog! No more today! Without support of the US congress Israel would be in real trouble.

Jon Stewart's viewership has dipped with the 18-to-49 demographic? Just shows how irrelevant Nielsen is! No one under 30 is watching cable television. Two of my three adult children (ages 27-40) don't even subscribe to cable. They watch everything on-line.<br/><br/>I just pray that Trevor Noah will ably take up Jon's banner. If there's any hope for our nation, it will be that someone will continue to expose the Fox News hypocrisy to our youth.

Why are you, the critic, asking for more than evasive exchanges?  Evasive exchanges are exactly what happens in these situations most of the time,if one is a polite person, unwilling to insult someone.  Shocking as it may be,many of us who go to movies-and we are decreasing in numbers-do not want the screaming or yelling that pervades television and "serious movies".  Life is subtle. French films get that and it is a shame that thoughts and feeling can't just linger in the movies.  That new study reported elsewhere in this paper really needs to be analyzed.  Why should movie makers throw in  gratuitous transgender,lesbian, or cross dressers when even the most liberal multi-cultural person rarely meets one such person in a lifetime.  There would be more women in major roles if writers would write scripts about women's lives.  Virginia Wolf died years ago and few writers can claim to replace her. So, if you want more angst between characters and women in directorial roles  and as leading roles "Go Get a Writer"!

Cook for 10 to 12 minutes ???  NO WAY I say...!!!   If you steam them that long, they shrink and are dry, tough and rubbery, and lose 1/2 their volume... I use a huge, deep 14" diameter saute pan, 4 inches deep with a lid, and add 1/2 inch salted water with herbs (use the recipe)... Boil the water, then add clams, maximum 2 deep... Be prepared with tongs to remove them individually immediately as they pop open, in a second, starting in FOUR minutes...!!!  You end up with the most tender, clams in the world... A few may take 8 minutes, and a few will only open an eighth of an inch, but there is nothing wrong with them, heck, they were boiled to death...!!!  The reason for the shallow pan is so you can see them open better than by using a 10 inch deep steam filled pot...

What do you really know about Judaism &amp; the Jewish People? How can you even entertain such a concept to attack the whole of Judaism &amp; the Jews because of the actions of a few, no matter their religious beliefs or affiliation?<br/>Judaism &amp; the Jewish People have no monopoly on intolerance. Indeed, throughout the history of the Jewish People, we have been victims of intolerance by others who have believed themselves to be pious, holy &amp; reverently religious people. Many times this intolerance lead to mass actions such as banishment, enslavement, forced exodus, violent attacks &amp; massacres bent on the total genocide in the name of G-D!<br/>Judaism as a religion &amp; a philosophy, &amp; the Jewish people condemns such actions &amp; behaviors; as they are against the true meaning of Judaism, which is to accept others without judgment.<br/>Each person is responsible for their own actions &amp; an immoral act even if done out of passion for religious views is still an immoral act!<br/>How hypocritical of you to condemn all of Judaism &amp; the Jewish People as a faith of hatred. The beliefs of Judaism are at the heart of both Christianity &amp; Islam. Both of those religions owe their existence to the existence &amp; the beliefs of Judaism. All three religions have more in common than they have differences. To hate Judaism &amp; all Jews (based on your narrow knowledge base) is to hate all of Christianity &amp; all of Islam for the same narrow set of understanding that seems to guide the thoughts you chose to pen in this space!

Has this country EVER really believed in diplomacy?  Really, list an era where diplomacy ruled the day.  I can only think of one: the presidency of Jimmy Carter.  Other than that, we let guns speak for our country. <br/><br/>On a side note, how can diplomacy succeed when the nation's largest newspaper runs items like this:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/06/top-hillary-clinton-donor-comes-out-against-iran-deal/" title="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/06/top-hillary-clinton-donor-comes-out-against-iran-deal/" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/06/top-hillary-clint...</a><br/><br/>1) I guess the Times is now just is going along with the idea that oligarchs get to decide our politics.  Even oligarchs from other countries! <br/><br/>2) Does this now mean that, in fact, a campaign donation means how *exactly* a politician will govern on the issue?  That article certainly implies exactly that.

Your example is San Francisco? Ironic, given that SF is *exactly* the prescription that Cohen is suggested for the rest of the US.<br/><br/>Do you know why SF has so many homeless people? Because of the city's generous homeless benefits! We spend millions building SROs, subsidized housing, public housing. Why do you think SF's roads aren't paved? Because the enormous city budget goes to welfare programs instead of paving the streets or picking up the trash. The city recently cut funding to tree maintenance so it could spend money on, for example, free Muni tickets for low income families.

I Think A Better Question Is: "Does America Believe In Democracy"?<br/><br/>IT is obvious that it Did Not in 1953 when it "Overthrew Iran's Democratically Elected Government".<br/><br/>AND here is a reminder on how we got here based on Falsehoods and Propaganda:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYutojeC5Kk" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYutojeC5Kk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYutojeC5Kk</a><br/><br/>WHAT we are witnessing in the US today, is the "Demise of Our Own Democracy Championed By Special Interest Groups a la AIPAC".<br/><br/>IN A Way We Have Now Become The Victim Of Our Own Deeds of Seven Decades Ago As Iran Says: "Never Again"!

When this enormous crowd of clowns announced their candidacy for president, one of my first thoughts was "What is the strategy here?" It didn't take me long to realize that all of these voices bleating to be heard drown out the the voices that the American people need to hear. "Mainstream media" can say with at least minimum plausibility that they aren't "intentionally" ignoring important candidates because all of the raucous noise of the Republican clowns IS being reported.<br/><br/>But have you heard that Bernie Sanders has caught up to "Hillary" in most polls? And this is with almost no national coverage of him or his message! And "Hillary" is frantically shifting her political message to shadow Bernie's statements because he is gathering Democratic, Independent, and even some Republican voters!<br/><br/>I attended a local political organization meeting in Reno, NV tonight. I was surprised to hear that there had been 29 more held previously that week in Reno alone. I would never vote for "Hillary" or any of the no-integrity Republican clowns who have betrayed the American people for 30 silver coins (probably much less).<br/><br/>I think 2016 is going to be full of surprises!

He speaks to who?? Middle/lower class Americans?  Surely, you jest?  He has NO clue what it is like to be a struggling American~none!  He speaks to himself and his need for 24/7 attention.

The only difference I see between these two men is that one has a moustache and the other one doesn't!<br/>    Mr. Brooks does not seem to understand that the "reason" we lost in Vietnam and Iraq is that we "actually" went to war against these two countries. Now Brooks is advocating war with Iran? What kind of logic is that? Why should President Obama even contemplate threatening military action against Iran when he knows full well (from recent and past experience) that war will have disastrous consequences? Why shouldn't we listen to John Kerry who actually fought in Vietnam and understands the perils of militarism?<br/>     If ten or fifteen years from now Iran tries again to develop nuclear weapons, we can go to war against them at that point. Why not wait and see if the currently negotiated agreement will bear fruit?

"Can You Make an Awesome Burger at Home? Yes, You Can"<br/>August 5, 2015<br/>Sam Sifton<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/fashion/mens-style/can-you-make-an-awesome-burger-at-home-yes-you-can.html?ref=dining&amp;_r=0" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/fashion/mens-style/can-you-make-an-awesome-burger-at-home-yes-you-can.html?ref=dining&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/fashion/mens-style/can-you-make-an-awe...</a><br/>It is currently 1 A.M. right now, and I have decided to click on the food category to get rid of all these crazy midnight cravings. As expected, I was not let down. This certain article caught my attention because of its high definition picture of two small, aesthetically pleasing burgers. Just by looking at the thick patty, drooping cheese, juicy onions, fresh greens, and glazed buns made me drool. To further explain the quality of this burger, I would have compared it to the animated Krabby Patty which we ALL once drooled over. Not only did the picture catch my attention, but the title stated that I could make these kind of burgers at home, and I thought to myself, "hey, why not!"<br/>In the midst of gaping at the burgers, I also noticed how reserved we are to public outings. We spend so much of our time outside, buying ourselves these fatty meals that we forget that these kind of meals are accessible at home at a much cheaper price. I personally remember a time when my dad made our family a homemade burger stuffed with a thick patty, onions, and much more delicious goods and they were no match to any six dollar menu. Instead of simply throwing cash at valueless restaurants, maybe we can all start moving the dinner table back home.

Why on earth should CEO pay be a factor in state-level taxation and procurement policies? That is the most ludicrous, mid-guided notion ever published in this column (and that's a high bar).  State politicians and bureaucrats have absolutely no business regulating compensation at publicly-traded companies. By the way, why stop at CEO pay? How about product pricing? Don't like Uber surge rates? Higher taxes on revenues over 1.3x! (Oops, I may have just set the de Blasio budget gnomes in motion). How about product design? Coke is re-launching New Coke? Coca cola products are banned from all state and municipal buildings!  Why not survey folks who have an informed view on an interesting topic instead of repeating wacky ideas straight from the workers' paradise?

What woman in her right mind would vote for Donald Trump? Or any of the other anti-reproductive health misongynists? You'd have to be a total fool. Also, can you even IMAGINE a Democrat saying things like Trump said about women and getting this far? I think the expectations of Republican, Conservatives, and Tea Party men are so low, we just accept the outrageous and ugly comments as par for the course. What kind of people are these? These are men that truly believe only they are worthy, and everyone else, woman, gay, immigrant, African American, etal are lesser beings who don't deserve equal rights and protection under the law. And believe me, those rights will always be in danger if one of these heartless hypocrites gets anywhere near the Oval Office. Caveat Emptor, everyone!

Al Franken was elected by votes from felons and non-citizens?  Where do you get this crap.  Prove it! Prove just one of your examples of voter fraud.   There is a conspiracy in the State election board?  Prove it.  Oh, your proof is that someone you don't approve of was elected, so it must be fraud. <br/><br/>Where is your evidence?  Oh that's right.  You can't provide the evidence you need because "they" are conspiring to prevent the evidence from being collected.    <br/><br/>Now if you were talking about collecting evidence on the dangers of gun ownership, then I might agree with you, since congress has, in fact, made it illegal for the CDC to collect data on gun related injuries and death.

When the nine candidates walked on stage, all I could think was really, GOP? Not one woman in the bunch?  This is the best you can do?  The debate deteriorated from there.  What an unimpressive group of inarticulate, poorly informed, misogynistic men.  At least Rubio can string sentences together@!

How have we come to this?!<br/><br/>The Party that has made it their sacred duty to block, demonize, demoralize, and debase Obama has opened a new chapter of the absurd, vile, and indefensible.  Not only have they put up a list of radical candidates that combine, stunning obtuseness, a long list of mediocre achievements, and just plain unsuitability to the role, they have now turned their own party's vetting process into a circuis of mockery, boorishness, and, well... trumpery.<br/><br/>Some of them have lists of failure to their name that would cause many to wince.  Others opine on whether the potential equivalent of starting WWIII should occur on their first day in office, or if they should wait awhile.  One wants to send in US troops to block abortions - a procedure that is *still legal* across the nation. One presided over one of the greatest corporate disasters in recent decades<br/><br/>The winner so far: the most outrageous, clownish braggart of them all!  God help us!<br/><br/>Tell me again why Obama is such a bad President, or why Hilary would be almost as bad... Anyone?

Earnest people on the left express bewilderment; why, they ask, does American working and middle class vote Republican, against their own economic interests?  'tis because these crafty republicans appeal to their social fears, religious bigotry, envy, and prejudice - they have concluded.  <br/><br/>So I guess the democrats could get these nice folk to vote for them once they told them about how Republicans are not representing them.<br/><br/>Wrong!<br/><br/>A segment of republicans (40%?) are indeed angry about the things democrats say they should be angry about, but they are choosing to vote for candidates who are plain crazy and promise to do things without double talk (Donald the wrecking ball, Paul the Patrician, Carson the "I separated conjoined twins so I should be president").  Each time the Donald says he screwed his employees, his creditors, people cheer.  Each time he says something misogynistic, this segment cheers.  Each time he says he screwed over Uncle Sam by manipulating the law, people cheer.<br/><br/>Fox and Radio Noise Machines have won.  They have channeled people's insecurity and anger not only toward their vacuous shows on radio and TV, they have channeled them to unabashed crassness, loud-mouthary, boastful, "my daddy was not a mail man, but a rich dude who left me with enough money and connections to become a mogul."<br/><br/>You go Donald.  Could you really do worse than the Bush I &amp; II administration?<br/><br/>Kalidan

Does your Mother have Social Security and Medicare? I now have both and I had to have a photo ID (driver's license) to apply for both! I'm sick and tired of the whiners. Photo ID required to get food stamps, any kind of welfare, go into any Federal Building, fly on a plane, leave the country, etc.

This is so comical, can you imagine if Texas said they would euthanize dogs and cats on sight if they didn't have a valid license? The gazillions of dollars and volunteers would come in from all over the world to help.  <br/><br/>While we wait for SCOTUS- The liberal left who annually shells out tens of millions of dollars for animal rights and environmental concerns; need to divert some of that money to start grassroots programs to help needy people get the correct I.D. This includes locating the correct paper work, getting them registered at the DMV and help navigate the long lines.  <br/><br/>Quit focusing on Queeny, Prince and Duke all the time and help Grandpa and Grandma for a change!  

305314
And how about that rowdy live audience? Like a circus! They gave little indication that they were interested in a thoughtful debate about the issues. Wildly cheering the same old fact averse talking points, and facile arguments. They were little more than a kangaroo court, I'm afraid. What an undemanding electorate Fox News has nurtured.

305353
Israel simply another theocracy, Ms Valdez? Seems like people like you are so ignorant of the reality in Israel, that it would be funny if it wouldn't be so outrageous. Israel is a flourishing democracy, with a free press, which often attacks the government in no uncertain terms, a Parliament- the Knesset-with freely elected members, and of which the Arab List is the third largest party, a Supreme Court made up of famous legal scholars and judges-one of whom is a Christian Arab- who enjoy great respect among knowledgeable fellow legal minds abroad, and media such as TV shows with commentators in the ilk of Jon Stewart!  Tel Aviv is a major attraction among Western gay tourists, with a famous club life and a gay beach-by choice. A large segment of the student population of the Hebrew University is Arab. One could go on and on. Yes, Israel has the high ground, and Israel is still, though sometimes flawed, as is the US, Ms Valdez-a democracy. The day when Iraq has as its third largest party the Jewish List- oh wait, there are almost Iraqi Jews anymore, they have fled or been terrified into silence-or when Gaza or Syria has a Gay Pride Parade, that will be the day when maybe Israel will not be the only democracy in the Middle East anymore. <br/><br/>And if you want to talk theocracies, look at the country of the Mullahs and Ayatollahs- where gays are hanged or flogged almost every week.  And your own US is rife with racism or homophobia, Ms Valdez-so I would come off your own high horse!

305355
Perhaps it's because none of those topics are of any interest to Republican voters or if they even acknowledge them as problems ?? Also, no questions about police violence, guns, voting right etc. !

"Insiders", huh? Do you mean the CEO of GOP, Inc. Why don't we just call him and ask him. "David, David Koch? Good morning, this is the New York Times calling about the debate your company hosted last night."<br/><br/>Never, ever, ever would this Democrat have believed what my eyes and ears were forced to endure last night. I don't know what was worse--the Fox coverage or the handpicked bunch of bozos they are peddling.<br/><br/>I *say* I am a Democrat, but that's not even true. I have been a GI, (independent for short) almost all my life. The only reason I am identifying as a Democrat at this point is because of my utter rage towards the GOP. <br/><br/>You know what was telling? Megyn Kelly asked "THE" question of the night; yet afterwards, during the commentary, it was barely mentioned. When she brought it up, her two male counterparts shifted in their seats and changed the subject. The misogyny is SO ingrained that they don't even notice its transparency!<br/><br/>So hell has officially frozen over, as the only person I could take seriously was Jeb Bush. So yeah, that happened.<br/><br/>I  think anyone who has ever called themselves a Republican ought to wake up this morning MAD. The party needs to be taken back. Campaign finance reform MUST be addressed and the Koch Brothers and their other shadowy friends MUST GO AWAY.<br/><br/>This is going to do go down as a sad chapter in American politics.......so  long as the Republicans don't win and rewrite the history books. After all, if they got away with it in Texas....

??? what are you talking about ???<br/>It was live and on at 9:00pm.<br/>My god, anything to dig at Fox!

It's pretty clear,  they are not going to give up their pursuit of nuclear weapons - we didn't, why would they?   And, according to what I have read, bombing them would risk fallout.  And, I highly doubt they would bomb Israel, as Hamas would feel that one, too!  (Probably their own people, too.)  So what difference does any of it make!  And, David, after watching last night's debate, I have either won you over, or you need professional help! 

306137
Americans and Europeans different?? Say it ain't so!  The only disconcerting part of this poll is that 35% choose a safety net over freedom.  I love Europe, but having lived there and visited over 100 times, I compare living there to living in your parent's house.  You'll never reach your full potential with someone else paying all the expenses!  I pay close to 40% of my income in taxes, and another 10% to my church; shouldn't 50% cover the safety net?  Europeans lack a West like ours, both literally and figuratively, for their needle to settle.   

306287
Voters in both parties are wearly of the 32 year Bush-Clinton-Bush-? dynasty.  This is why Hillary fell so fast from a virtual unknown candidate in 2008.  Both Jeb! and Hillary! lack any plausible reason for really running for President.  Any Trump doesn't need the boodle from becoming President, he's already a billionare.  Look for both parties to ultimately select a fresh face for the 2016 race.

306348
Shouldn't that be "the second coming of Ronald Raven"? That's how he is remembered, and venerated, in Texas. War hero, vanquisher of communists, victor in the Great War against Grenada, economic genius (why, he has 12 credits in economics at Eureka College!), sworn enemy of welfare queens. Have some respect.

306382
David, you have the audacity to compare the Iranian deal to the defeats of Viet Nam and Iraq ?<br/> Both of those tragic wars were instigated by the U. S. under false pretenses.<br/>Perhaps you forgot LBJ and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which was proven to be false ? Perhaps you forgot the ridiculous fear mongering of of the "Domino Theory" and how the fall of South Viet Nam would lead to the fall of SE Asia ??<br/>Perhaps you forgot the fear mongering of Bush and his neo-cons on Iraqs WMD. Perhaps you forgot Cheney quoting this newspaper (with stories he planted) about Saddam WMD program ? Perhaps you forgot the lies about the link to Al Qaeda or Colin Powell's disgraceful performance at the U.N.<br/>You compare these two horrific chapters of American History, which tragically took thousands of young Americans, millions of Vietnamese, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis to a legitimate attempt at rational diplomacy.<br/>You are engaging in the same fear mongering that led us into both of these tragic episodes. You are exploiting fear and uncertainty to again fan the flames of war.<br/>The same war mongers who blindly led us into Iraq and were wrong about every prediction as to the outcome now want a crack at the real prize, Iran.<br/>As I have said, for these people Iraq was merely the appetizer, Iran was the entree !!!<br/>Sadly, the real state sponsor of terror in the world today, in the eyes of the world, is the U.S.

Why is this rule waiting to go into effect until 2017 ????<br/>The launch date should be January 2016!<br/>The delay only give the GOP congress and their buddies at the US Chamber of Commerce a good shot at fighting it to its demise.

How can I justify my subscription to the NYTimes if they are going to allow this sort of specious twaddle to be posted?<br/>I know not a single person who is pro-choice and pro-abortion!<br/>No civilized, sentient individual is comfortable with, or glorifies, the termination of a life! But since the beginning of time women have found ways to self-abort for a variety of reasons: Often, it's because of feckless egotistical men with inferior character! Many women in conservative political and religious societies, with no option for safe medical procedures, end up badly scarred, maimed or unable to have another child.<br/>I don't want to make the judgements that would mean driving women into back alley abortionists who are unlicensed, unregulated and often lack proper sanitation, equipment and supplies!<br/>Simply put, it's not my decision to make!<br/>I cannot and WILL not support a politician who would subject women to butchers so I must leave these traumatic decisions to women, their doctors and their consciences!

Where to start? In reality, Republicans care more about a fetus than they do about the woman; especially about THE BORN CHILD! If you did care, stop cutting SNAP, provide health care to all children and stop writing articles like this one, that try to shame the rest of us into your pathetic way of thinking. So let's get to the heart of your magical thinking. "Abortion rates are generally lower in (conservative) states that have more abortion restrictions and fewer publicly funded family planning programs, and higher in (liberal) states..." Yes well that's because the women in red states go to blue states to have the freedom to choose. "I dunno, get out of the dismemberment business?" OK, that is really a myopic view of the situation. Countless lives are saved from research that uses these fetal parts that would be destroyed. And, it's LEGAL BTW!<br/> "telling pro-life and pro-choice Americans alike that contraceptive access and fetal dismemberment are just a package deal". How smug, using the term "package deal". That is heartless, emotion charged, incorrect... and you know it.Finally..."don’t bring your worldview’s bloody hands to me and demand my dollars to pay for soap enough to maybe wash a few flecks off". Wow, what a way to stir up the pot. Again, you really don't care about THE CHILDREN, you care about your twisted view of, shhh...sex; premarital sex and the relentless pursuit of all that is not aligned to Rossisms. Please Ross, go away. You are a quintessential hypocrite.

I know it was Comedy Central, but was there any content?<br/><br/>By all the reports and comments (mine included) it seems nothing was realy debated. <br/><br/>Who won and lost is not the issue. They are all losers when it comes to compassion, dignity, respect, accepting change and diversity in the world as well as here at home.<br/><br/>Most of them want to go back to a world without a China (pop. 1.2 billion and a bomb), emerging India (pop. 1.3 billion and a bomb), Pakistan (with a bomb), North Korea (with a bomb), world-wide environmental changes looming, an African continent looming in the background, and civil and national unrest in the mid-east.<br/><br/>Focusing on fears and ancient texts (much like those of Islam) is no longer a road to be followed because quite simply, it will not work. Even Pope Frank knows he has to open the doors of a dead church filled with child abusers and self-aggrandizing cross dressing homosexuals to get the take increased. Otherwise more church and catholic school closings and if you don't brainwash the kids early on, poof, there goes the show.<br/><br/>Back home, our President's efforts at arriving at a peaceful agreement with Iran, a country we and our close European friends have violated for 100 years, are being compromised by elected representatives here. None Dare Call It Treason! was a right wing book written years ago. But it might be worth reading again.<br/><br/>Thimk about it.<br/><br/>Did this police line-up identify policy, issues and solutions for the weary to ponder? Seems not!

Spare you?!? Spare you!?!<br/><br/>Spare us. Spare us your sanctimonious clap-trap and your faux outrage. Your opinion only has value in so much as it continues to impact the lives of women you care nothing for, know nothing about, and can't even begin to understand. 

307262
What kind of parenting (or lack thereof) turned these creatures into such pathetic, timid avoiders of life? Even their greeting... "Hey!" is so devoid of communication and feeling. I guess it's conceptually all part of the amazing college "safe rooms" (or whatever they're called) with the lollipops and teddy bears and avoidance of any interesting (threatening) ideas. Please: Turn off your little electronic toys; read literary classics to get some idea about being a functioning, adult human; stand up and be counted and be hurt and, in time, be a fulfilled, happy (sometimes) adult. Little children are cute; 20-40 year old children are pathetic!

307270
Wow Chris Williams, misogynist much?  Here's a news flash:  men's looks fade too.  And those younger women dating those older men, the men just interested in the girls' shiny youth, the men not having matured past high school when only a girl's face and body mattered?  Think the girls have more depth than do you, looking at your soul and not your wallet?  Think again!

@DWR:  "How did that turn out for you, David?"  I'm sure it turned out fine.  He didn't fight.  Did anyone in his family fight in Iraq?  Will he or anyone fight in the Iran war he so desperately wants, it seems?  No.  He makes a lot of money from the System.  The System works very, very well for David Brooks.  Of that we can be sure.  Send others to fight Iran!  Not David.  David just bloviates, he  has become almost as bad as everyone else in his terrible party.  It's a party that wants to bring down America.  Why I don't know. But all their words and actions point to it.  What they really want is a theocracy.  I wonder how David would feel, being Jewish, if a Pres. Kasich said we all had to believe as he and his evangelical friends believe?  It could happen here.  A theocracy is what they seem to want.  How about you, David?  How do you think THAT would feel to the Jews in America?

307495
The first debate highlighted the Republican War on Women, how is is that a party can be so pro-life/anti-abortion and want to kill Planned Parenthood's ability to reduce abortion with family planning and contraception?  <br/><br/>Then seek to kill post birth healthcare, food stamp programs, and preschool education as a useless entitlements.  <br/><br/>Apparently Republican pro-life commitment ends at birth!

dmutchler:  "Refurbished air"?  Really? Refurbished air that's too cool to promote proper sweat functioning?  Are you kidding me?  Sweat function works fine on almost everyone:  the harder you work out, the more you sweat.<br/><br/>Maybe someday you'll get over your smugness long enough to figure out that outdoor air quality can be very bad; that exercising indoors with filtered, air-conditioned air is actually quite good for people with lung problems, and also that exercising in cool conditions is necessary for some people (for instance, those with multiple sclerosis).  You may also find out that orthopedists recommend ellipticals to patients with certain knee problems.<br/><br/>Sorry you're unable to enjoy a meditative workout on an elliptical, but enjoy your "forest bathing" and all the interesting insects and bug-bites that go with it!

Why all the hate for Donald Trump?<br/><br/>American voters are always complaining that politicians are "too correct" and that politicians are afraid to speak their minds.<br/><br/>Yet, Donald Trump is speaking his mind and not caring about being PC, and he is being vilified!<br/><br/>Damned if you do, damned if you don't....

Why didn't you tell us before? David Brooks can see the future! David Brooks knows exactly what the Iranian government will do years before it actually happens!<br/><br/>A shorter version of today's essay might be: "Obama should have turned over Iranian policy to Bibi Netayahu and gone to war immediately instead of waiting to see if there's an alternative." Ironic that Brooks should have cite Vietnam and Iraq as precedents. Those were cases where we did indeed resort to war to achieve strategic objectives. Results? How, one wonders, could anyone still think that war is a means of obtaining strategic objectives? The mind reels.<br/><br/>Meantime, what could be the driving force behind Iran's determination to have nuclear weapons? Islamist fundamentalism? Or could 30 years' domination by the United States, the Western power that installed, then pulled the strings, of the puppet "shah," have something to do with it? Is that the way to achieve strategic objectives? <br/><br/>What is the appropriate term to describe repeating the same formulaic nonsense over and over in the face of all evidence to the contrary?

307911
Loathsome?   We (CIA, John Foster Dulles, Eisenhower etc. etc) overthrew the DEMOCRATICALLY elected president of Iran, (Mossadegh) in 1957 to serve the interests of Britain which was furious over the nationalization of oil by Mossadegh.  The hated Shah was reinstalled and was in turn ousted by what you call a "loathsome" Islamic regime.   And here we are.  Can you imagine what the Middle East might have been if we had not intervened in the overthrow of the Iranian democracy?<br/><br/>The really loathsome party here is David Brooks!

308101
Why the obsession with the Koch Brothers?  Why isn't George Soros ever mentioned?  What about the donations from Hollywood?  Aren't jobs more important than income inequality?  We need religious minded leaders and need to stop the war on Christianity.  We now encourage abortions and sell baby body parts - I hope to God we get a leader with moral code!

308123
It was a Fox "News" show with a Reality TV star; what more need anyone say?!<br/><br/>I'm sure it was entertaining for the Koch Brothers, probably the only ones watching.<br/><br/>Those who do cynically vote Republican because they know our government is an oligarchy were hopefully sufficiently entertained last night by Trump.  The rest of us watched Jon Stewart and wished him a tearful goodbye.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rome -- I mean Greece -- I mean Puerto Rico -- I mean America -- is burning.

308460
Donald, <br/><br/>Ask yourself, "How many people are we talking about?" Millions!<br/><br/>How would we track all of them down, incarcerate, and deport all of them without turning ourselves into a police state?  What collateral damage would you do to families and communities?  You would completely tear up the fabric of this country if you attempted it.  And for what?

308496
When you watch a Republican Debate on a pro-Republican cable network, what do you expect?  Did you really think Fox would bring up anything that deeply made any Republican feel uncomfortable?  Yesterday was also the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965! It didn't even get as much as a "hint" on the debate.<br/>Mr. Trump really upset me over his comments about Senator McCain, but he was very vocal about helping Veterans. As a Veteran I was angry at first, but more or less forgave him since I knew he was as usual just running his big mouth. I love seeing the entire Republican Party treating him with kid gloves. There were 9 lost souls on that stage last night. Mr. Trump is doing what so many WANT to do...he's bring issues on the table that the Republicans have avoided. Yes the Hispanic community and Mexico may hate this guy, but truth is without Mr. Trump being so vocal, you can bet the immigration issue would not even be mentioned by the rest of the Republican Party. I would like to see a debate on a more neutral network next time! Fox Network was walking on eggshells. No way to moderate a debate.<br/>I remember well when Ronald Reagan was very vocal. He let Iran know exactly what to expect if he were President and the American hostages remained. The Iranians made sure that those Hostages left Iranian airspace at the very moment Reagan took the oath. Yep, sometimes it does take a man with NOTHING to lose to become our President to show the world.

The economy is improving?  For whom?  The Fed is "afraid" of overheating the economy?  Wow!  Quick!  Get out the fainting couch and smelling salts!  The fear of 2% inflation is making those delicate flowers over at the Fed feel faint! <br/><br/>According to Bureau of Labor Statistics factoid generator (<a href="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000)" title="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000)" target="_blank">http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000)</a> the proportion of Americans actually working (not just "looking for work") is an eye-popping 62.6%.  We haven't seen that high of unemployment since 1977.   <br/><br/>The economic meltdown proved that something was radically wrong with our economy (that it was based on magical thinking) and it hasn't been fixed.  Companies should be hiring, but the Fed's reaction is, well, they aren't hiring, so...oh well?  Nothing to be done.  Nothing to see here. Move on.  Gah!   <br/><br/>Two percent inflation should *only* be a target in an economy doing WELL.  Not when one-third of the workforce has given up trying to look for work. <br/><br/>The Fed's blind eye is absolutely despicable.  This just shows how the Fed does everything for the One Percent and Wall Street but does squat-all for Main Street and workers. 

308604
So the GOPers are over the top? What's new?<br/>What's new is The anointed D, Chuck Shumer, opting for Bibi and Israel ever America! We are, mostly, Zionists- but America first. <br/><br/>Not Chuck. He is picking bedlam- to align with Bibi.<br/>Bye bye, almost leader. You will be history. And you are losing your Prot base of pro-Zionists in America. Time to back off. Obama has picked an even playing field re the Middle East- in an effort to disarm the terrorists. He is aligned with the rest of the major powers.<br/>News for you, chuck. We no longer run the world a-la-Cheney-Bush. If you kill this deal, you will be creating a world mess. Is Israel really worth it? This Prot thinks not.

Looking and listening from Italy where for years, to the clowning and self-importance and smirking through the worst of moments, of Silvio Berlusconi, our question had been to Italians, "You're kidding, right? You can't have a leader who makes a sign to Michele Obama about her sexy body, someone who is corrupt and shows his disdain for the system, someone who supplied Kadaffi with prostitutes when he was in Italy. They said, "We don't have anyone else."<br/>That was incredible to me, who as an American was used to seeing always someone in the wings. Now we have tons in the wings, but all climate change deniers? All leaning righter and righter, to support "life" without assisting the poor and needy and children to have the benefits of that "life"?<br/>I must be kidding, and true this is the Republican debate and not the Democrats. I wonder, though, if people will be able to slow down and take the time to listen both to content, and to tone, the time that Donald Trump says he doesn't have. Well that's not all he doesn't have.<br/>I also wish this were just a spoof, a bit of late night television comedy. I can hardly believe it. Help!

You say incoherence: why not use plain English? Just admit these are sxtupid, and often very ignorant poeple who have risen to the top of their local ant hills but would just be benchwartming in the White House for whoever they jired and the Senate alloed them to actually run the place. The Prime example of this  sort of local dumbing down from the GOP is George Bush. Nor is his allegedly more intelligent brother, "Jeb!"  a whit better.

308736
"test", really?  At least the GOP has over a dozen of truly intelligent, decent, humans...and, not one drip of hate among them....but, even the NYT praised 'em...as for Trump...when those that slam him earn their own billions repeatedly by their own initiative...the, they can slam him...I personally think it is pure jealousy...those on the left, radical left, extreme left can't stand it!!!

 One more question for Mr Walker:<br/><br/> Are you seriously saying that you would plan a funeral for the mother of your children if her life was in your hands, rather than have an abortion? I am not talking about a grown baby as you folks like to imagine. <br/><br/>You would pick the rapist's baby over the mother of your kids? I am trying to wrap my head around the breadth of your purist belief system. Some commenter said she was watching this debate with little kids and they became very upset at your statement. I'm with them!

Risk taking and success?!? If you or anyone else hasn't figured out that the extremely rich have zero problems getting richer, I have a bridge to sell you in brooklyn. He's a brat born into wealth that has run roughshot over most people in getting richer. He could have taken a million different paths and still ended up, financially speaking, where he is. There is not much risk taking for the rich in their pursuit to get richer. There are plenty of common folk that they can pillage from...<br/><br/>He is a clown of the greatest magnitude, plain and simple. He embarasses me as an American...

To which unusual presidential candidate should we be listening, and why?  No – not THAT one!

Oh where will I find my next good read?  Being able to speed read, Jon would read the book central to an interview in an afternoon.  When politics brought me to sheer exasperation I looked to Jon to put it in proper focus.<br/><br/>Any of us who watched Jon knew EXACTLY what the first Republican debate would look like...spot on Jon!<br/><br/>But today I am terribly depressed....saying goodbye to a very good friend..as we all are.  <br/><br/>I have an exquisite hand made silk Puccini tie--red, white, and blue with these words embroidered on the back: “If we amply everything, we hear nothing”-Jon Stewart.  And on the front of the tie is Jon’s autograph.  <br/><br/>The Boss left us with “Born to Run”--two Jersey boys who did good!<br/><br/>I hope to see you soon Jon when you get back with that drink.

How can an organization (Planned Parenthood) that receives  $500 million  a year in aid from the US government, (it's in the budget) and still make contributions to Hilleary Clintons campaign?  It doesn't sound like they need the money. Matter of fact, organizations that receive government aid should not be able to contribute to anything. That's like giving welfare to a crack family. OH! We do that don't we?

Schumer is being bought by Israeli Lobbyists? Perhaps you don't realize that a corporation or a congressman may have dual citizenship both real and emotional, though by law they may only have papers for one country....<br/><br/>their actions may say otherwise, neh!?<br/><br/>And of course if Lobbyists are more important than a congressmans constituency because they can _buy_ influence/propaganda to get a "Congressman" elected in the first place . Perhaps being influenced by lobbyists is endemic and voters need to get a little smarter.....a lot smarter.....and you should start thinking about the patterns that have been used since the 7th Century BC.....

Why are so many people upset at Trump's 'offensive' treatment of Megyn Kelly? I like Megyn and her show, always have, but I find her 'public reaction' to Trump's response very disingenuous.  She got exactly what she hoped for with that well calculated question!  And what exactly was offensive or threatening?  Trump simply said he could treat her the way she treated him! 

310411
Off the point, perhaps, but since the Times is making available this forum on a rather esoteric (to most of its readers) operatic subject, might I point out the possible injustice inherent in its obituary pages, where the death almost two weeks back of major Italian baritone (and Met stalwart for 27 years) Mario Sereni has yet to be reported, and that of Czech Wagnerian soprano Ludmila Dvorakova (a world star for 30 or more years) similarly ignored? Surely this is due to prejudice against Italians and Czechs (maybe they were only passing as such), since some stumble bum second drummers in second-rate and long-defunct rock bands have no trouble making it into those pages. I think we need Peter Gelb to investigate this and make it right!!!

310443
Really? Kitchen sink? As opposed to a series where the long presumed dead hero returns on the eve of his sweetheart marrying another, reviving a moribund mine, which fails, and then! as he is saving a man (Mark) from the gallows by killing soldiers doing their duty, that man just happens to blurt out that he saw copper in that mine? Or marrying a kitchen wench? or any of the other plot turning moments in Poldark, or for that matter, other series?<br/><br/>Last Tango is messy, large, and is what happens when two very different groups of people meet and intermingle. It is life with a capital 'L".  Of course it is over the top! If it was a reflection of our own ordinary lives, would we want to watch it?!!<br/><br/>I would like to get a response from the NYT, posed in my original post. How is it decided what series to recap?

Unbelievable isn't it? Money talks! Everyone claims to be patriotic. But when someone throws a few thousand dollars in your face, the first thing you throw out of the window is what's good for the country.

Compare an elliptical workout to walking? No comparison at all! <br/><br/>I do a high intensity interval training (HIIT) workout on an elliptical and get my heart rate up to 90% of max for 1 1/2 minutes (then 1 1/2 minutes at "normal" rate; repeat 5 times). There is no way I could get to 90% of max walking. For me - a runner of 25 years until my knees gave out - an elliptical is like running in air. Smooth, no impact.<br/>A comparison I'd like to see is elliptical HIIT vs. running. That'd be a more meaningful comparison. Vs. walking? Give me a break!

news "Babe"?  And you think you have any right to speak of woman's rights and the so called "war on women"!<br/>Talk about double standard!  Nice to see the progressive left is so tolerant of woman who don't fit their preconceived notion of what a smart, intelligent and professional woman should look like.<br/>You go boy!

311003
So the answer to income inequality is a tax break to companies posting profits in the billions to encourage them to pay a decent wage?  Sorry, but no.  AT BEST, this article says "we need a few half-measures otherwise we'll have to start paying our fair share!"<br/><br/>Guess what: I'd rather you just paid your fair share.  The "*0% tax rate" is fear-mongering.  NO US politician is talking about anything even remotely like that.  The half-measures put forward in this article to stave off a peasant's revolt (how wonderfully condescending of you, by the way!) are grossly insufficient.  "Business leaders" have had over a generation to check their greed and have failed.  Now it's time for the government to check it for them.

311017
Really? I'm a private citizen, NOT a public figure or a corporation!<br/><br/>Do you think you have the right to know where I lived 15 years ago?<br/>Do you feel entitled to know where I work, how many children I have, what car I drive, what religion and race I belong to, which websites I frequent or what my hobbies are? <br/><br/>To no fault of my own (I don't use social media) and without my consent, all that information (and much more!) can be found readily by search engines  or obtained from "stalker" websites for just a couple of bucks.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to know these things about you. Then again, I'm neither nosey nor do I plan on exploiting your personal  data for unsavory purposes.<br/><br/>For private persons like myself, I support the "Right to be Forgotten"!

311098
Really? After complaining that he could be mean to Ms. Kelly b/c "you aren't being nice to me,"  the male sitting beside me just said, "What a baby!"  I don't think he's going anywhere with women as over half the electorate - regardless of what else he may have going for or against him. 

311136
So, "we" need *more* incentives for businesses?  No.  "You," corporations making record profits, need to do the right thing and raise wages--without *another* tax break.<br/><br/>Enough!  We already have too low of taxes on corporations.  The already stretched middle-class has gone along with cuts on corporate taxes, time and time again, and gotten nothing in return for it.  The earned income tax credit sounds good, except, when it is looked at critically, reveals itself as nothing more than another tax subsidy for businesses which allows them to avoid paying low income workers a *decent* wage.<br/><br/>No, here's what we really need in this country:  the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court made political bribes is legal.  Right now the American people are lead by politicians who don't legislate in the best interests of the entire American economy but only for what's in the best interests of the top one-percent and top shareholders of multinational corporations.  <br/><br/>"We" should  pass a constitutional amendment that reforms campaign financing.  

311277
A decision was made to fire 12 rounds and kill a man in less than one minute?!  <br/><br/>When there was no weapon in sight, no immediate threat of death or debilitating injury and the victim, after being shot, turned around to face the cop, only to receive 5 more bullets, in addition to the one already given him, for essentially wavering around after being shot?!<br/><br/>I am not saying Michael Brown was an angel, but death for lifting a package of cigarillos?!<br/><br/>And Darren Wilson, does he not expect to be cursed at when he showed the first signs of hostility?  Is he not trained how to protect himself without a gun, taser or baton?  He's a police officer--an alleged peacekeeper--and not an assassin.<br/><br/>It's the officer's duty to always take the higher ground, and cause no harm (if possible).  Darren Wilson's fear and adrenalin took over, and he had inadequate training in self-protection and verbal negotation.  <br/><br/>A guy who shoots as he did clearly has no business being a police officer, unless he is behind a desk.<br/><br/>And clearly, better training in people skills and options other than use of violent force need to be taught to U.S. police officers.

311695
Senator Schumer voted for the Iraq War? Of course he did. He is part of the political past &amp; the country urgently needs to go forward. By putting his personal needs to be reelected by his strong Jewish constituency and putting Israel's dubious agenda ahead of his own country's national and international security plan, Schumer has only demonstrated how he needs to be defeated in his next election. As a NYer, I will be voting against him. Too long at the fair. Bye, Chuck, there is a golf course (Trump!) waiting for you. 

311736
Are you kidding me? I'm a woman, and a lifelong football fan (Go Big Blue!) and I find this seriously insulting. No need to search for insults here--the Bucs' site suggests that women are only into football as an excuse to make crafts and to keep their menfolk happy. You really can't see how that's a problem? From a corporate standpoint, let alone a societal one, it's a boneheaded move.

311892
So shouldn't all the government-hating conservatives and libertarians start packing their bags to go live in their tax free paradise?  NOW?<br/><br/>OK, let's fast forward to the future, where the Kansas Experiment has been hailed a success and they're feasting in Wichita.  You've got a business, and it pays no income tax.  Awesome!  But, on the other hand, your workers pay huge sales taxes and user fees for everything --  food, school, gas, highway maintenance, medical care -- whatever they do, they have to sacrifice huge chunks to pay for it.  So, all other things being equal, you'd have to pay your employees much higher salaries to compensate for their higher cost of living, wouldn't you?  All that money you saved in taxes gets paid out the other end in compensation.  <br/><br/>From here in the future, it doesn't entirely seem worth it.  Still, there's a mighty nice statue of ol' Sam Brownback in Topeka.  At least there's that.

How does one argue against anyone who believes an invisible deity decreed a group of people 'chosen' above all others who are then given exclusive real estate rights along with other 'special satus benefits? That such deity did not choose to personally express this to the multitudes of actual and potential adversaries but instead chose to communicate 'through exclusive contact to only the benefactors, who eventually committed this to writing and then demands forbearance and literal belief from all that follow'? Ditto secret divisive messages from Christ and Mohammad...!<br/>      Religions certainly has it's place but dying and killing other people based on evidence that borders on the absurd is troubling, to say the least.

312244
How do you make this assumption? Iran has lied about everything. It even violated the sanctions by just sending a General responsible for the deaths of 100's of Americans to meet with Putin in Moscow. Do you really believe that a country that rants "Death to America" and Death to Israel", that funds terrorists around the world wants peace?! You are naive, if you do.

312481
You think that Obama and his minions are honorable???  Is violating the Constitution honorable as well - because that has been their primary strategy.  They are the most covert and dishonest administration in history.  They are paranoid beyond belief and complicit in the ruination of this country - leaving it weaker than at any time in our history.  If you think that Kerry negotiated a good deal then you have not read it - and oh, by the way, neither have most Americans since segments of the agreement are still hidden from all of us by this dishonest administration (see Side Deals).  Get a grip!!!

312777
You want a good antidote to this piece (smug? get thee behind me, Satan!), read today's Krugman's piece on  GOP.  And these are the open-minded and civil  "conservatives" that Mr. Alexander implicitly invokes in taking "liberals" to task. Oy!

312807
A tax break for corporations that "do the right thing" in lieu of a realistic minimum wage law which includes mandatory health-care insurance?<br/><br/>You have got to be joking.<br/><br/>If this bloody government was working for the people,  we would not be having this discussion!

312812
More "tax incentives" for businesses?<br/><br/>I've an idea!  How about we middle class folks stop subsidizing businesses and oligarchs, and instead they patriotically pay their fair share of taxes?  <br/><br/>Another place to start: eliminate conversions, off-shore accounts, and industry subsidies (agribusiness, oil &amp; gas, etc.).  Voila...a large amount of revenue for our country's schools, infrastructure, etc.! 

312862
Which camp is more open minded, more likely to accept and incorporate new scientific findings?  Global climate change deniers (anti-science) people are running the committee meant to study and pass laws on those topics! Such as "Rep. James Sensebrenner (R-WI), [who] decried climate change theory as a "massive international scientific fraud" and evidence of what he called "scientific fascism." Another climate skeptic on the committee this year, Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), suggested in a hearing that "dinosaur flatulence" might explain historic warming patterns."(TPM, BENJY SARLIN PublishedJANUARY 11, 2013).<br/> It's astonishing. 

312891
When was the last time your Senator or Cogressperson called your home and asked for your opinion on a pending bill or treaty?<br/><br/>Huh?<br/><br/>Mine............never! And I'm 60 years old.<br/><br/>I suppose they only listen to robocallers to their office.<br/><br/>You know, the special interests.<br/><br/>We shouldn't have to call them. They should poll us.

312968
Or admitted to a misjudgment or mistake? Hillary voted "yes" on the Iraq War, and apologized for it. Bill Clinton pushed the harsh sentencing of the 90's and recently apologized for it. Who can imagine Cheney, GWB, Rumsfeld, or any other neocon (yes, you, John Bolton!) doing such a thing? 

312994
Contrite?!  He parades himself as "Mr Netanyahu's man on Capitol Hill."  He says that his one job is to protect Israel.  He does not say that he should also protect America.  He does not feel that is his job.  That says everything that one needs to  know about him.  He poses a clear and present danger to the US and its interests.  

313036
Huh?  Everyone has seen it. Articles I've read say Schumer has been seen carrying around a copy of it. Seriously. Get your facts straight!

313120
Hi there,  What timeframe was that?  As you probably know, Almanzo Wilder had a sister named Laura (who isn't in the books). It was definitely a family name, so if it wasn't that Laura Wilder, I wonder if it was younger brother Pearly's daughter or granddaughter.  The location is right, that's for sure!<br/><br/>If you want more details, I can help.  I love research and I truly love Laura Ingalls Wilder. 

313129
Where's my comment from this morning?  (Forgive me).  <br/><br/>Thank you, Jon! It's been a long day and I miss you already.  It's a beautiful evening and I hope you're on your way to a distant beach.  Godspeed.

313154
What are allies anyway, especially when they aim to control Americans' opinions? This has been Israel, and I for one, object. I disagree with Netanyahu, and I know why I disagree. Does anyone else? That is the real question here!

313241
I disagree with your statement "came to his own conclusions about the Iran deal?" It is clear to me that Sen. Schumer is caving in to his conservative Isarel supporters. He is backing PM Netanyahu. This is usually what he does when he faces difficult issues, and it is wrong-headed. In 2007 he was listening to his backers as he cheered on the major Wall Street banks which supported him and then the economy tanked. Seeing him then look so betrayed was pathetic. Imagine that! A US Senator betrayed by a major banking donor. I guess he forgot about the Keating five. AIPAC is squeezing very hard and so is every other major Netanyahu supporter. I guess Chuck is chucking it in on this one.

313594
@Elaine:  Are you kidding ME?  Ellipticals are "terrible for you"??  I seriously question the information your sources are using &amp; the qualifications your sources have.  I have been told by the Chief of Orthopedics at a major medical center in NYC that an elliptical is the best &amp; safest thing for me to use (and I have had multiple surgeries on my knees!)  The elliptical gives me a full workout (both concentric &amp; eccentric contractions) without damage or injury.<br/><br/>You are also 100% INCORRECT when you say there is "no variation in terrain" - my elliptical has ramp settings for incline that go from 1-20 (with 20 just about equal to a 40% incline) AND it has resistance settings that go from 1-20.  That gives me plenty of variation, and I can do HIIT on it as well.

313683
New Flash?----investors are better served shutting out the white noise of CNBC! Yes thanks, we know that even without watching Jon Stewart.<br/>It’s a commonplace that Wall St pays ‘ungodly sums to settle’ and no guilt admitted, since the lack of financial crime convictions by the Holder DOJ is widely discussed.<br/>And we’ve heard of Judge Rakoff. We know about the cast of dubious characters listed in this column and their negative influence. The stench of Goldman Sachs dealings from Detroit to Greece is obvious.  <br/><br/>We know Cramer is basically a big mouth media attention hog---so maybe he’ll run for president like that other one. He isn’t very interesting, frankly even if you can relate it to the big media event of Stewart and your being on his show. <br/><br/>And why not “get back to the fundamentals of reporting?” We need more than just another catalog of  big bank crimes, while the banks are now bigger than ever. <br/><br/>Mr. Nocera, so what do you see as the financial regulation and consumer protection issues for the 2016 campaign?<br/>And where do the candidates rate on them, so far?<br/>Which banks are the biggest donors to which candidates and what are their corresponding platform proposals ?<br/>I‘d be interested to read what you think. 

313802
Here's a question, why have conservatives never aired their own genuinely funny program like "The Daily Show"?  I recall some attempt on Fox a few years ago and it was laughably un-funny . . . that's why I'm always skeptical when I hear a thoughtful conservative quibble with Stewart's influence. Maybe they're just jealous!

313938
He made his case public-- I read it-- why do you readers keep saying he is somehow withholding his reasons? Just search for his statement !! It makes perfect sense.

313950
Doesn't Schumer represent the citizens of New York? Or does he represent Bibi Netanyahu? <br/><br/>Israel!<br/><br/>Here's Schumer's answer to your question.<br/><br/>"One of my roles, very important in the United States senate, is to be a shomer — to be a or the shomer Yisrael. And I will continue to be that with every bone in my body ... "

Has any one pondered that only 2 countries officially oppose the Iran Deal: North Korea and Israel, along with  all the Republicans and some democrats out of "misguided" concerns for Israel,  as well as some hardliners/conservatives  in Iran,and  Saudi Arabia?  "Chest thumping utterance of "We are the Great," and a myopic view of the World, I believe,  will accelerate  America's  diminishing influence in the Real World. Sanctions and economic leverages, in the face of world opposition or disagreement will surely dissipate over time, leaving the region and the World more chaotic. <br/><br/>  Obama and the Democrats have some understanding of the changing nature of the geopolitics and doing their best to keep America's positive and viable influence in the World.  Republicans have a history of misjudgments and poor understanding of dynamics of geopolitics: Their policies have cost American lives and influence starting from losing South Vietnam after five years of so called  negotiations, and more recently their blunderbuss involvement in Iraq (giving rise to Iran's influence there), and a total lack of understanding of the Middle East dynamics that led to 9/11. They don't seem to understand the ISIS and Al Queda's who are bent on attacking fellow Muslim moderates as well as the West, or any country allied with the West, including Israel, and they  are the mortal enemies of the Shias of Iran.<br/><br/>It is a very complicated picture.  Hopefully the American public will become aware of this!

314286
What? What? What?<br/><br/>Do my eyes deceive me?<br/><br/>An article on the needs of men?<br/><br/>I almost overlooked it with all the feminist whining over manspreading, mansplaining, manslamming and manconditioning (the latest feminist neurosis over office temperature).<br/><br/>Great article!!<br/><br/>Now maybe we can start discussing REAL gender balance...<br/><br/>Like why men get more jail time for the same crime.<br/>Why only boys are forced to register for selective service<br/>Why men are 90% of workplace fatalities (not counting the military)<br/>Why men have to work longer hours for the same pay.<br/>Why our schools are not working toward educating boys.<br/>Why the Obama refuses to light the White House blue in September for Prostate Cancer awareness (like it does it in PInk in October)<br/>And this<br/><a href="http://womenshealth.gov" title="womenshealth.gov" target="_blank">womenshealth.gov</a><br/><a href="http://menshealth.gov" title="menshealth.gov" target="_blank">menshealth.gov</a><br/><br/>Imagine that... just imagine if we really did put an end to sexism and really starting to care about gender balance.<br/><br/>This article is a start at least.

Reverse Mortgage? Buy an Annuity? This advice seems to totally contradict most of the advice that I hear the daytime pundits provide to many older Americans looking for advice on what to do when it is probably too late. The best advice to me is to pay off all debt (most importantly the house), work as long as you are enjoying it, save as much as you can, budget smartly, and learn to life a miser's life. Stockpile that cash and then move somewhere cheap and enjoy!

People in the upper middle class having only $1,300 a month after paying the bills?  What bills take so much of income over $100,000, or 250,000?  I should have such expenses.  An 80% tax rate? who's talking about that? What, on incomes over ten million?  Oh the horror, the horror!<br/><br/>But take heart; this writer has a solution: a TAX BREAK for the really rich, so they can afford to pay their employees more without having to forego any green fees at the country club or designer dresses for the next gala.  It boggles the mind.

314997
Completely agree with you but if the result of the DOJ Inquiry IS an order to make changes going forward, who needs to act on that order and what happens if that order is NOT taken up or addressed?<br/><br/>Which is EXACTLY what will happen.<br/><br/>NOTHING.<br/><br/>Until or unless there is Accountability, Responsibility AND "Give a Damnability"!<br/><br/>For unless the Public, the People ...Society shows a real concern and that they do not accept this sort of Behavior.. lack of: values, morals, justice, fairness and equality, then nothing will really ever change and things will continue to degrade to an even lower common denominator than should ever be tolerated.

315024
Jon Stewart smug?!  What about Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, . . . .   <br/><br/>Oh, what am I doing?  "Liberal Smugness" is just a Conservative meme meant to discredit an earnest citizen who used his comedic talents to critique those in power.  They always attack where they are weak.

315095
Why not tell the survivors' stories of the Battan Death March and the Japanese prison camps?  Tens of thousands of Americans either murdered or mutilated by the Japanese soldiers..........we should not just hide the story under the rug.  My one uncle was murdered and my other uncle spent 43 months in the prison camp as a slave.  Let's tell that story!

315156
Wait, let me see if I get this straight- Alexander is saying that liberals, but not conservatives, believe that people on the other side are "fundamentally different" and inferior in their worldview?  Wow.  Republicans have made a specialty out of claiming that liberals aren't even "real Americans", with their constant refrain of "Take OUR country back!"  <br/><br/>He is right that most of us on the liberal side do feel superior to the Republican clown car, and the people who vote for these morons and bigots. But I have a suggestion for Mr. Alexander and his fellow conservatives: if you don't want liberals to act smugly superior, stop parading around your ignorance.  Stop acting so stupid, and we'll stop acting superior.  

315186
Capitalists arise?  I say the Capitalists need not take the blame ... but how about tax free non profit groups!  A prime example in New York City alone, and according to Al Jazeera America, the Catholic church is worth $121 billion ... The Donald .. 1 billion ... and it is the largest tax exempt property owner ... 24 parochial schools shut down and up for sale ... yet neither the money nor the property is returned to the local communities .. that paid higher property taxes because these  properties were  taken off of the tax rolls.  When sold the money reverts to Cardinal Dolan, tax free ... he doesn't even pay capital gains.  I might point out ... that he can name any price, such as a lower price for the sale, and the buyer thankful for not having to pay higher transfer taxes etc ... donates to a Catholic organization ... he gets a deal, the public is taken for another ride.  List all Tax exempt non profit organizations ... then talk to the capitalists who work and pay taxes.

315234
Isn't it funny that Rep candidate Bush says the way to economic recovery is to raise productivity of working people when productivity has been raised 80% in 40 years?  What did they get in return?<br/><br/>Corporate America will not change their ways until they run us all in the ground.  If the government tries to increase taxes they will just move their headquarters to another country to avoid them.  Some already have.<br/><br/>I think "civil unrest" will be the only way to change things.   I don't know where the author found his "CEO" friends.  Personally I think he's hallucinating!

315328
What's for "liberals" not to understand about conservatives? You're self-centered, older men, who hate anyone who is not exactly like you, prone to violence and hate, people who lie through their teeth about anyone they don't approve of (gays, women, organizations that help minorities vote, organizations that provide health services to women, all poor people, handicapped people, unemployed people and anyone who is not a radical Christian bigot.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, they're racist hypocrites who live off the wealth of the billionaires who own them, lock-stock-and-barrel.<br/><br/>Seems pretty accurate to me. And Jon nailed it.<br/><br/>Now, in keeping with their latest strategy, they tug at our heartstrings proclaiming themselves the poor, suffering, victims of gays, women and the poor, their great generosity and compassion disregarded just because they desperately need to discriminate against other people, and anyone who tries to stop that, is discriminating against them!! As explained in this hopelessly desperate and embarrassing article.<br/><br/>Sorry, nobody's buying what you're selling, here. Try Breitbart, they'll lap it right up!

315363
Really, conservatives, but not liberals believe "there is" not "an important asymmetry in American politics"? Then why do conservatives work so hard to create asymmetry between individuals who do not act and believe as they? Oh, by the way, Mr. Stewart's program did resonate with like-minded people, but he did not "train" anyone.  Is it not interesting that it takes a smart comedian to make us take notice of how we are failing to engage in a meaningful discourse to mature our nation to the benefit of all our citizens and those who wish to join us. "Get real" Mr. Alexander!

My, my, my - look at them now: the APA  (now) strongly (after the fact) reprimands interrogation as practiced by those who got caught, because they got their (collective) APA reputation sullied?  As if there had been a line that had ever been drawn before.<br/>It's the era of Obama!  They've gotta quarterback this thing ....<br/><br/>I spent a few years in undergrad psychology - questionable ethics such as seen herein were never delimited then, as it is not now.<br/>Whether psychiatry or psychology, cultural dictates and cultural  imperatives have dominated the field.  Ethics have always been seen as a quesy option - paraded loudly only when taught, then ultimately expunged. <br/><br/>Here's the APA mantra:  Cuz we all need a job, and we all have to do a job, and if I don't do it, someone else will.  <br/><br/>That's psychology/psychiatry today.

But how savvy about the market does one need to be?? If one doesn't enjoy - actually, hates - reading company earnings reports, etc, is it worth the money you might (MIGHT) make to spend a couple hours every day doing something you hate?? Why retire at all then?!?<br/><br/>A professional card shark might recommend that as a way to make money, but most people won't be able to play at that level nor feel comfortable with the risks.

Where does one begin with this article? So many inaccuracies, it is like I am reading from the Fox network! Let's just try one:<br/>"Specifically, they believe that liberals are much more open to change than conservatives, more tolerant of differences, more motivated by the public good and, maybe most of all, smarter and better informed."<br/>Have you not followed the current campaign? The GOP's front runner is a guy that spews hate and is intolerant toward minorities and women. Get a a grip and face reality.

This clown is suppose to be an academic? Yoo says "...waterboarding isn't torture, so if YOU WANT to waterboard its OK!" But Yoo didn't tell Bush to waterboard....huh...that's exactly what he did.

Why don't they do that?  Here is the reason...Americans are always bad until someone somewhere wants our help or our money.  I recently heard someone say Americans have no culture...in fact Americans have no right to a culture according to some.  I am pretty sick of this attitude.<br/><br/>Are we perfect..hell no!  But neither is any other country.   We need to stop looking at our navels and start dealing with our chaotic present.  We need to come back home and fix our own country and let others fix their own.  <br/><br/>History is useful and important but we need to look at it all..the GOOD, the bad and the ugly...unfortunately everything the US has ever done is now apparently bad.  It's getting pretty tiresome.

What does funding have to do with it? Read the article, the FDA was rubber-stamping approval. It was her due diligence that saved us, not more funding. Stop making everything about your beliefs!

Can we liberals at least have our one show where we can vent?<br/><br/>From regressive tax policy under Reagan, bank deregulation under Clinton/Bush,  war of choice, infrastructure decay, union busting, no public option for healthcare, rollback on abortion rights, voting rights under attack, explicit racism and misogyny, attacks on patriotism, guns guns guns,  income inequality, climate change denial, creationism in schools what's a liberal to do but turn on the  TV  after a long day and hear one wonderful voice of reason.  I will MISS YOU JON STEWART!

316505
So, Gerard, is the obtuseness genetically endowed, studiously cultivated or merely affected?<br/><br/>Jon Stewart is an entertainer who cultivated a television audience and successfully played to them to the very profitable benefit of himself and the station.  To critique and to judge Stewart as some kind of public service education outlet who fell down on the job, failing in his primary responsibility, is silly, ridiculous and an admission of partisan-based intellectual bankruptcy!

Surely this is a joke, right? The word "puerile" comes to mind! I hope it's a tuition  free activity.

Well what can one do? If we want to return to the great old days when men were men, we need a candidate that thinks, behaves and speaks like the way men once did. We have no problems with that!

lol Know it All - who said anything about climate?<br/>p.s. we *are* (as you point out with'some degree' already changing (by influencing!) conditions of the troposphere, thereby negating your own  gobbledygook.

"Liberal smugness"?? No "Conservative smugness"??? The man is a comedian! You ought to spend time analysing the "smugness" in the vast right-wing outpouring that passes for journalism.

All the women who surround him: wives ex and present, daughters, and why not? All men too should spit on his face. Also all the republicans who think like he does but fail to admiti it. He is a buffoon, the world is laughing at us!<br/>Che schifo!!

How low is low? When will RNC will admit the damage Trump is causing?<br/><br/>The political climate in US not just convoluted, it is HIGHLY toxic as well. In what OTHER advanced democratic country does this happen?<br/><br/>What EXACTLY is the mindset of the die-hard Trump supporters?<br/><br/>This reader of course does NOT have an answer to ANY of these questions. However, this reader DOES know the following.<br/><br/>The political leaders can bray ALL they want and beat their chests proclaiming that the US is the leader of free world. In reality and at this time, many major countries do NOT give a rat's behind when it comes to US. They may be scared of US because of its military might, but they do NOT respect US ANYMORE!!!<br/><br/>Having watched the US political theater from the sidelines, this reader ALSO believes that after Eisenhower the Republican party has been in a tailspin. To this reader NO Republican President has truly shined. Many give credit to Reagan for dissolution of USSR - for example - but in reality USSR imploded from within due to unsustainable communism.<br/><br/>To an unbiased observer - and yes, it is difficult if not impossible for an American to be so - the Republican party has degenerated into a morass of ego, huge lack of intellect, pettiness, vindictiveness and ANY kind of such negative mental trait one can think of.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is quite important that US currency says - "In God We Trust". With the current crop of Republicans, all US can hope for is being saved by God and ONLY God!!

Jon Stewart objective? Please! He's another organ for the Obama-fawning fringe parts of the Democratic Party. His railings agains the Republicans and conservatives were vicious; those against the Democrats and liberals mild and occasional. That fact that both were sometimes funny is irrelevant.

Aren't journalist suppose to do research about who or what they are talking about before the show? A journalist prepares for an interview. Clearly, John King did not do his research or just did not ask the hard questions he should as a journalist. Live? So what! Do your job!

all things cosidered isnt it time for a change? ya vote for one of the others you're just shouting "I'm afraid to make a difference ... more hillary more bush more abuse please"! didn't einstein say something about stupid being the one who does the same thing over and over and over again but expects a different outcome!

Erick Erickson has the nerve to do this?  Here's this guy's track record:<br/><br/>Keep in mind, this sudden burst of indignation is coming from the same man who said...<br/><br/>About Ted Kennedy: "Today Ted Kennedy plots our deaths..." (h/t The Political Carnival)<br/>About Judge Souter: "[he] is a "goat f*&amp;king child molester"<br/>He thinks Rush Limbaugh is Jesus.<br/>He openly called for armed revolt and beating politicians to a bloody pulp.<br/>He said the media "gang-raped" conservative politicians.<br/>Suggested that the Nobel Committee had an affirmative action quota<br/>Said that "leftists are Nazis" and the Nazis were liberal socialists.<br/>Said that the Alaska Democrats gave out Sarah Palin's SS# (a fact he pulled wholly from his posterior)<br/>Told his readers to send Olympia Snowe rock salt for her work on HCR. (Rock salt melts snow--get it?)<br/>Suggested that Obama was friends with a child molester<br/>Claimed the left has more dominance in the blogosphere because the right are too busy raising the children they didn't abort.<br/>But wait! That was the 2010 collection. We're not done yet.<br/><br/>In 2012, Erickson had no problem sneering at Tammy Duckworth's military service so he could defend deadbeat dad Joe Walsh's sexist comments about her.<br/><br/>In 2013, his first column for Fox News led off with this lovely imagery:<br/><br/>"The editors of the New York Times often come across as school girls at a Justin Bieber concert when it comes to the Democrats. Thursday, they upped their school girl skirt just a bit more for the Democrats."

Immigrants? On two jobs? Really? Do the numbers. Than take in the reality of multiple beds in multiple rooms.<br/><br/>Charles: on the income issue you have allowed your imagination to override evidence. In the 50s, many were illiterate in the giant factories; today more income is solid incentive to finish school and acquire skills! In the blindness of failure can you not see the path to success is paved on higher incomes that allow rent, food, and utilities to be paid from paychecks--and at the current minimum wage, which you surely know as a New Yorker, certainly more than two!

And under the cover of clownish tactics, why is it that these Republicans are the ones who have surfaced for the most powerful position in the world?  Because huge money backs people they can ultimately control. There's more at stake than this election. Get sober, people!

I don't get this? All Megyn Kelly did was ask Trump about things he actually said about women that are demeaning, insulting, and gross. Why should she not ask that question? It's relevant if a potential president of the United States is a misogynist!

If you're calling it "The Commune," then why does its actual name appear a half dozen times in this article? A pretty hefty editing error, to say the least.<br/><br/>Many of my loved ones have found sanctuary at "The Commune", and I hope to visit one day myself. Brava, queens! I wish you much happiness and great drag. Blessed be!

Have you seen the Mckinney, Texas incident? Or the Dubose shooting? Please watch them. Those are perfect examples of officers who were not afraid of the people they abused. They wanted to crush resistance at all costs, and went beyond the law to do so.<br/><br/>But lets decode your argument about fear. This is what you're saying in simple terms: "DOJ stats show that Black people are relatively more violent that other ethnicities. Police, therefore, understandably fear for their lives more around Blacks and end up harming them more more in self defense. <br/><br/>Here's the flaw in that narrative. First, DOJ stats show that violence has a higher correlation with poverty than race. Secondly, although policing is a thankless, incredibly difficult job, it is an officers duty to assess each encounter from a neutral standpoint and apply the level of force that merits the situation. Any one person cannot be lumped into a larger statistic. This fits the "innocent until proven guiilty" spirit that guides our legal system and our way of life. <br/><br/>If an officer displays bias or fear that negates objectivity or a willingness to apply proper force and care to a given situation, then they should be removed and held accountable. Fear is not an excuse; overcoming it is ingrained in their duty and training. And if we don't have systems in place that enable our officers to remove their biases/fear, apply proper force, and hold misbehavior accountable, then we need to develop those systems. NOW!

When did we lose the fight on cell phones in the workplace? The other day I was grocery shopping and the bag clerk was "bagging and texting" simultaneously. I did that job in 1985, and I guarantee my store manager would have gladly marched me out of the store with my last paycheck in hand. <br/><br/>Our values are gone, our work ethic diluted- we are so doomed!

First of all, we see ads for various brands of sanitary napkins every day on television, and we all know that women have cycles, so what is all the fighting about? In KELLY'S case, it may be irrelevant anyway, because, being a woman in her mid forties, MK is probably menopausal. We also know that when a woman is having her period, she is subject to mood changes, and in considerable discomfort, so why is it politically incorrect to raise the possibility.that MK was experiencing vaginal discomfort?Sex education for children starts in elementary school, and sometimes in pre-k, Thus, why is menstruation and its possible effects on a woman a taboo subject? I believe that DT will benefit in the end from this, part of his own "straight talk express!" To call Eric Erickson "weak and pathetic" sums up the opinions of many hard core Republicans.

"Follow the Money" - Didn't Trump say this?  Fox Network is making a financial killing out of this.  Wonder what Trump's cut is?  "Hey, I can keep this show going for weeks but I want a 10% increase every week - or I will make a deal with another network!"  Poor Republican party - taking the hits on this. Just proves politicians are not good business people.

What's the difference from great comedian Donald Trump's remarks about us, menstruating by the eyes or whenever (is not the correct way of saying it,  from whatever? I am just asking since I am one of those "fat pigs" from  the other side of the border), but going back to el señor Trump, at least he is a great comedian but what about el Señor Rubio (to give only one example, yes, I could have also picked el señor Walker). Rubio--without  Trump's great bangs--forcefully stating that even if we get pregnant because of rape, hey chica! you got to have the kid! Si señor! OK, seriously, I don't understand why so much money is spent to sell ideological garbage if this is just a wonderful political advertisement of why not to vote for these loonies! Adios amigos!

Paris waits-are you scared enough yet? <br/><br/>"The result<br/><br/>It was a fantastic success — for the attendees, most of whom enjoyed an expense-account funded vacation with their peers in picturesque Copenhagen. Here’s the word salad they produced. Three journalists at the Guardian evaluated the Conference in terms of its accomplishments: Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure.<br/><br/>Flash forward to now<br/><br/>Six years later we’re still in the pause — the hiatus or slowing of the atmosphere’s warming (see papers about its causes) — with most forms of extreme weather at normal levels (details here, more here).<br/><br/>Doubling down on proven failed tactics, climate activists have began a fear bombardment to produce a stampede of panicked people into November’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (Paris! No global climate conferences in Chicago or Birmingham, where events are cheaper).

Where was all the hand-wringing when Congressman Wilson called Obama a "liar" during his State of the Union speech? Or when Trump, among others, went on their Birther crusade? Obama has been called a Muslim, a traitor, has been accused of promoting legislation that would create "death panels" and on and on and no one in the Republican Party was concerned about the lack of civility or serious discourse among the faithful. <br/><br/>And oh, the irony of Fox News being hand-wringer-in-chief! The mind reels at the hypocrisy of it all!

Yes but who is going to pay the ever increasing social security and medicare taxes it costs to support you in your old age?  <br/><br/>You're probably one of those joggers or healthy eaters who's going to live to 90 and soak the unsuspecting kiddies who crawl out of college owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans.  <br/><br/>Of course, you won't demand that we return ss funds to the heirs of smokers and transfat-breakfast fatties who kick the bucket at 65.<br/><br/>America is such a great country.  One man's freeloading is another's noble purpose!

"Urban pioneers" who were probably young, white, well educated and, more then a few I'm sure, supported by their parents who helped them refurbish the homes the stupid, lazy black people couldn't get the funds to fix, right?  I mean the African Americans and their families had been living there for decades. Why couldn't they just walk into the bank and get a loan or make the city listen to their complaints and get stuff fixed. Gosh, it was so easy for you and the "urban pioneers" to get it done. <br/><br/>How dare they complain while you do whatever you wish in your new up and coming neighborhood! They should just let you drink your cappuccino in peace.

"Expand our base"? Expand to what? Party weaklings, yes boys and girls. Politically correct, offend no one. What world do you live in? The republican party stabs most of us in the back time and time again. Your party is the party of fools. I have been voting republican for over 50 years and the "party" is over. Dump Trump and millions will dump you and your party of talkers and con men!

Wonder how John McCain feels?  Trump insults a blond Fox entertainer and the GOP goes crazy!  He insults John McCain and it takes days for some, but not all, of the candidates to get upset.  I think this shows the priority and the soul (or lack thereof) of the GOP.

320865
You're kidding about Trump, right? You say you don't like Trump but then you come to his defense and claim he was "bullied". Give me a break! Trump can hand it out but cannot take it. If someone goes against him, he returns with calling them idiots, weakened, stupid, unprofessional etc. etc. He just cannot take it at all! The sooner he disappears the better. I am so glad that I am not a Republican. He is an embarrassment to us all no matter which party we belong to.

Safe to assume you spend a lot of time in the mirror?  Got all those nose hairs trimmed?  How about your eyebrows?  Wait, you forgot your ear hair!  Man, I can smell the cologne from here!  Quit trying so hard an get over yourself.  I'll take a nice old man over a dandy any day.

Sorts are  both "childish" and "callow"? What complete nonsense!<br/>Come before me  and BEHOLD MY HAIRY LEGS! --long in sinew and muscle, legs that a werewolf would be proud to own-- currently well ventilated in my Eddie Bauer khaki cargo shorts. It's 92 degrees outside and I am certainly not going to wear my wool dress slacks while mowing the lawn or going to an outdoor concert this evening.<br/>Get real.

321135
Do American men wear anything but shorts in warm weather?  Not so's I can see.  Most of them pair those wretched cargos with a striped pullover and look like the boys I was in 2nd grade with back in 1966. I wish men still dressed like men!

321158
No shorts in the 50's?  Really?  I lived in Topeka KS in that era and every single man out mowing his lawn, was wearing shorts - often with a Hawaiian shirt.  <br/><br/>Every spring, the boarding school that my husband and son attended, always "discovered" that while coat and tie were compulsory, nothing in the dress code said anything about pants length and these "rebels" all donned their madras bermuda shorts with their navy blazers and ties.  <br/><br/>Some men (and women!!!!) have the legs for shorts and some do not.  My first husband has always been rather proud of his very shapely long legs, and has been known to extend "shorts season" well after Christmas, even though he lives in the Midwest.  When driving to our town to spend Christmas with our daughter, his arrival was very overdue (and he had no cell phone).  There had been a major snow storm the day before.  My daughter called the highway patrol to ask if he might have been found in a snow drift.  They asked for his description; shorts, sandals and a white beard.  The highway patrolman deadpanned the question "mental problems?".  We've never let him live that one down!

Seven hundred dollars just to diagnose the problem?   Ye gads!   And what basis did the mechanic have for estimating the cost of repair without performing a diagnosis anyway?    <br/><br/>There's a bit of me that actually wonders whether a relative or buddy owns that junkyard and gives him a piece of the action when somebody throws away a vehicle that can be put back in commission, either with some simple and cheap repair or with an engine out of another vehicle,  and resold.    Either that or an extra zero crept into that $700.

why is it in politics since the 60's when people speak the truth about what americans are truly thinking about your called a disrupter?  i watched that debate and you could tell right away the fair and balanced was non existent. they went after trump with national enquirer garbage and did not ask one question pertaining to if he got in the white house, while the rest got the normal puff ball q's and the normal meaningless responses. it almost seems like ailes is sewed to the behind of the bush's and he got really puff ball q's! it makes you wonder about fox and their blurb of fair and balanced. the vast majority of blogs are saying the same thing. while i don't plan on voting for trump i am going for the hp ceo she is a true leader and has a back bone she would beat the walking old lady in pant suits as a leader and president. if we must have a woman lets put a leader in we have had 6+ years of helmless country!

321853
WHAT "ideas??" <br/><br/>The only idea Republicans have, if you can call it that, is "trickle up economics," otherwise "voodoo economics," so called by Dubbya's father, himself! The primary Republican strategy goes like this: "Let's keep all the money for ourselves... and screw everybody else!" Do you recall Dubbya himself affirming that "we don't do the reality thing?"<br/><br/>How about getting your conservative pals to "stop doing and saying stupid things" and THEN the rest of us will quit making fun of them?

322235
It's really funny how women get all offended when a man puts down a woman for her looks by calling her a pig or fat, but then it's perfectly fine for women to make fun of Trump's hair?  What kind of double standard is that?  Maybe you'll say "but his hair DOES look weird!" to which I'll respond "and that woman IS fat and looks like a PIG."  There is no difference, and if women (or men) can get away with making fun of Trump's hair, calling it a squirrel or whatever, then really folks, it is fair game.  Trump is then free to give you all a taste of your own medicine.

322309
 When will we as a national government stop treating marijuana as the devil's fire?<br/><br/>Facts show marijuana has some risks and dangers. The industry itself, esp. in Denver, does an excellent job of informing consumers of these. Retail packages have chemical content breakdowns by percent and  information about cautions to consider. Retail packages are sealed rigidly to discourage immediate use--no buds in jewelry bags. Retail personnel are trained in guiding customers through the purchase process, without sales pitches. (I used more sales techniques in selling shoes at department stores.)<br/><br/>Denver encourages open conversation about marijuana, with strong support for safety and caution; esp. preventing its usage by children and teens and in not creating a community ethos of an open, permissive climate (street usage, loitering near outlets, soliciting and petty crime), while supporting responsible private use.<br/><br/>For a March week, I visited Denver, attending a Stevie Wonder concert. I was amazed at the utter lack of distinct smell in a sold-out venue in a city where pot purchases are lawful. Nor during the week did I see anyone smoking on the streets, even in neighborhoods with clusters of young adults, common in other cities. <br/><br/>The big issue is the massive build-up of cash. Banks are fearful of accepting the business revenues. It is probable the Administration clarify this without Congress making new law. To aid prosperity and order, this needs to be done!

Is this immigration such a terrible idea?  Europe is aging, and not replacing itself.  The immigrants are young, energetic and ambitious.  The resultant mix might be the best thing that could happen!

322721
Huh?! lol.  Donald has been a democrat forever... but who cares.  He's not any different, but perhaps much better, than all of the other power hungry men in the world.  The big difference is DT is an open book and doesn't care what you think, not really.  The 'Devil' has been let out a very long time ago; in fact it will be the nice sweet lovable candidate that you are voting for whomever it is; not the loud mouth that DT projects.  We all know DT is not the devil; and I think you do too.    

322724
So Trump is rude?  Politically incorrect?  What a surprise!  What I found really appalling were the comments of several of the others on the stage, denying women the right to terminate their pregnancies even in cases of rape, incest, or<br/>possible death.  It looked as if Rupert Murdoch's Fox News was determined to take Trump down and it may have done so, but if we ignore what the others were saying we have only ourselves to blame if women lose the right to choose.

322799
Erik Erikson--anyone remember the obscenity he called David Souter?--has a line for decency?  LOL!<br/>Kelly is apparently the only female entitled to any respect, and she is not for telling the truth for other women, whether it's PP edited tapes or denying abortion for a woman even if her life is endangered by the fetus--yes fetus, not person.<br/>The rest of the civilized world watches us, slack-jawed at the spectacle.

322877
Why would you always live for the future and not in the present? This seems like it could lead to a very impoverished way of constructing a life. <br/><br/>Frugal, not overly oriented towards 'stuff', seems OK. But life is about beauty and growth and possibilities and opportunities and living !! Live a true life of your own and life will be its own reward.

Just curious --- how did the co-op camouflage the foul odor when this buyer was looking at the apartment, and possibly returned multiple times before purchasing it? Did the seller make a deal with the hoarder?  Doesn't the seller have to disclose negatives to a buyer...?  Caveat emptor!  This reminds me to be vigilant when considering buying real estate.  This is a nightmare.  Not to mention that there may be a pest problem as well.

"bleeding from her wherever" and you think he meant "nose?!??!?"<br/><br/>That's hilarious. You know who believes you? NO ONE.

If Mitt Romney would have ignored and forgotten 47% of Americans, can you just imagine how few Americans a Donald Trump in the Whitehouse would care about ?  I'm betting less than 1% !  And still nobody has posed the question.

Do the life decisions of many of the people in this piece greatly contribute to their troubles??  Yes!!!  <br/><br/>But if we don't ensure a system that allows all people to recover from bad decisions/environments when they are ready what happens?  We accept (or relish) condemning people and we hurt our own prosperity.<br/><br/>How many workers, parents, families, or just-not-a-part-of-the-prison-population, small business owners, possible paradigm changing entrepreneurs, or even Einsteins that can elevate the entire [human] race are we willing to throw away each generation?  How many generations will it take until we notice our current 'solution' is not changing enough outcomes?  <br/><br/>We haven't even come close to reaching our potential as a country because of this race/gender/income paradigm people sustain institutionally and individually.  Our economy would truly be the most dynamic on the planet if we actually tapped into all our human resources.  But we'd rather divest from our collective education and opportunity to pay for segregated low income housing, a prison industrial/law enforcement complex, new sports stadiums, and of course more tax cuts to social/family services to convince ourselves of the existence of our grit...<br/><br/>Then we tell the downtrodden they should make better choices.  OK.

We accept (or relish) condemning people and we hurt our own prosperity.<br/><br/>How many workers, parents, families, or just-not-a-part-of-the-prison-population, small business owners, possible paradigm changing entrepreneurs, or even Einsteins that can elevate the entire [human] race are we willing to throw away each generation?  How many generations will it take until we notice our current 'solution' is not changing enough outcomes?  <br/><br/>We haven't even come close to reaching our potential as a country because of this race/gender/income paradigm people sustain institutionally and individually.  Our economy would truly be the most dynamic on the planet if we actually tapped into all our human resources.  But we'd rather divest from our collective education and opportunity to pay for segregated low income housing, a prison industrial/law enforcement complex, new sports stadiums, and of course more tax cuts to social/family services to convince ourselves of the existence of our grit...<br/><br/>Then we tell the downtrodden they should make better choices.  OK.

Trump's still a Republican, right?<br/><br/>Thank you, Jesus!<br/><br/>Dems will sweep the 2016 elections.

In reply to Don Shipp from Homestead Florida: "Carly Fiorina is the living metaphor for income inequality"?! Do you realize how wealthy Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein are? I don't hear any grumblings from you about their wealth or connections to Wall Street.

 Progressives "believe that liberals are much more open to change than conservatives,"<br/>Duhh??!!<br/>Are definitions relevant at all, or are facts, as appear often the case with conservatives, to be avoided at all cost?<br/><br/>Conservative definition: holding to traditional attitudes and values &amp; cautious about change or innovation, typically in relation to politics or religion.<br/>Synonyms: traditional, conventional, orthodox, old-fashioned, dyed-in-wool, unadventurous<br/><br/>Progressives on other hand, maintain and work toward visions of a better world<br/><br/>They believe mankind has potential to evolve forward in a positive direction, as opposed to remaining in a state where they need to go out and beat animals over the head with a club and drag them to their cave where their perpetually subservient wife awaits.<br/><br/>Conservatives are all about holding back change.<br/>If Congress does absolutely nothing, they are absolutely thrilled.<br/>Good luck convincing Conservatives that our economy has become lopsided in the favor of a fantastically wealthy tiny percentage of Americans, for example.<br/>This is just our "free market" at work they say.<br/>To expect anything else would be "socialism" which they apparently appear to equate with communism, even Nazism.<br/><br/>I attempt to treat people with respect and to be open to other's perspective, but it can be quite frustrating to observe "foxes watching over the hen house" in our country and Conservatives perpetually fighting to maintain and strengthen this status quo.

If the Republican candidates and party can't figure out how to deal with or beat Trump, what makes anyone think they can deal with really tough issues like Iran, the economy or China?  I'm sure, after almost seven years in the job, Obama laughs at the idea that Trump is a real problem.  Not ready for the White House.  Not one of them!

"Do we want to insult 53 percent of all voters? "<br/><br/>You insult them every day, Jeb!  Saying too much is spent on women's health is insulting. Crowing about defunding Planned Parenthood is insulting.

I can't believe that were reading "What Do the Poor Need? Try Asking them."<br/>Good grief! This is not about liberal versus conservative policies. It's not about socialism versus self reliance.  Crime, poverty and juvenile delinquency exist because parents have no jobs, little education, little access to health care, and child care and even access to transportation.  Generally the poor live in hopelessness. and despair in a never ending cycle that is imposed by Republicans and Democrats alike.  What do the poor need? Everything but mostly jobs. Without jobs nothing else can happen.  People want dignity. They want to support themselves and be independent. They want a future for themselves and their children. People want to live in neighborhoods without drugs, crime, gangs and violence. People need safety and security. People need productive schools and access to good health care. What do the poor want? They want the same opportunity for advance in life that others have.  The poor want access to banking and checking and loans for homes and appliances at reasonable rates.  The poor want a life the same as you and me.  What the poor don't need is Republican and Democrat policy makers who think they know and won't ask.

Is Trump crude and rude?   Absolutely but his alleged mysogny doesn't come close to the offensive anti women policies spouted by the theocrats on stage on Thursday.  It is unfortunate that Trump gets the heat while the rest get to tell us that they would! For example, Let a woman die rather than allow her to have a medical procedure to save her life or that the Consitution should be used to strip women of their right to physical autonomy.  Yes, by all means let's focus on Trump!

Can you explain the difference between alcohol and marijuana - basically why is it acceptable that alcohol advertised in all forms of media, but you think marijuana should not be?<br/><br/>I do not smoke pot, although I did 30 years ago, and I do not see a difference between marijuana and alcohol - other than alcohol can make you violent and kill others with your car, while marijuana's big danger is over-eating and saying "groovy".<br/><br/>Thanks!

325402
Oh please, this is a top pick? There goes the media, picking the most ridiculous response for the thoughtless masses to get on the bandwagon with. Seriously, we're suppose to be the most intelligent species on the earth...except during election time. We forget the very basic rules our mothers taught us. Two wrongs don't make a right. Both participants Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly should both be ashamed of their behavior. Neither deserves the attention they're getting. They're both very bad examples of how thoughtful mature persons should conduct themselves. They don't deserve backing on either side. They behave like guests on the Jerry Springer show and you mobs jump in with your attacks on either side. It's stupid and immature. A real disservice to the way human beings should behave. Making our country look backwoods and ignorant. What's next? Are our candidates gonna start duking it out on stage for our entertainment?? Ridiculous. Nexxxxt!!!!

Has the average salary tripled across all of Russia, everywhere?  For everyone? WOW! And all since 2000? In a mere 15 years?<br/><br/>Well, then truly Mr. Putin is an economic miraclemaster, and the press worldwide should be lauding such a fantastic performance. Every hotel in Moscow should be crammed with academic economists descending on the place like a horde of rampant locusts to study the Russian 'Economic Miracle". <br/><br/>Hmmm. Where are the stories in the world's press about this?<br/><br/>And all in the face of an American / European boycott and a tumbling oil price?<br/><br/>Get real. I'd like to know where the author got that statistic and to whom it does (or doesn't) really apply.

325707
So suddenly the Conservatives and Republicans are concerned about how women are treated????  Gee, stay out of reproductive lives altogether.  And doesn't anyone else question why a question even involved whether they promise not to run as an independent?  That's a substantive Presidential issue?<br/><br/>The lack of human decency in the party is at an all time low.  Now they want to be sure to hide their true feelings otherwise it will cost them the election.  Hopefully, 53% of the women they referred to won't vote for them!

10, 8, 3, 1, 0 ? That was a Jon Stewart moment !! Thank you Maureen for that. Honest and to the point and above hilarious! The misogynist, venom-mouthed, narcissist met his match in Megyn Kelly. His intolerance and disdain for anyone or anything Don is beyond any comprehension. But what's new ? He was being himself not wearing a smiling mask like the others on that Fox podium. Your entire op-ed is pitch perfect save one. His jibes at women has not lost some but all the women's votes which is 53% of all votes. Maureen, your fear is justified. Await his tweets come Monday morning!

Ask yourself this: would two adults, each working full time, earn so little as to get a Section 8 certificate? <br/><br/>Or is the truth that they are unmarried so that Ms. Wade can claim the "full ride" welfare benefits only due to single mothers? Meanwhile, of course, she LIVES WITH her baby daddy, who is not on the lease.<br/><br/>I do not believe that Section 8 rents to unmarried couples. So in fact, she is asking the landlords to commit fraud with the Federal government! then she wonders "why won't they rent to me?"

326417
Pardon?! VERMONT is a "citadel of power"??!! Vermont is the most rural state in the country, has a northern region notorious for its insularity and quiet poverty (I've been inside some of those tar-paper roof shacks in what Vermonters call the "Northeast Kingdom"). Vermont has the best health services in the country and, as mentioned, plenty of poor people, only they're white. Vermont is also notorious for being politically independent. It has the only Socialist senator in the US, and was the only state FDR lost in 1932.<br/><br/>Any other myths you'd like to tell us about VT because it doesn't take federal money for Section 8 housing?

What is wrong with having her read this?<br/><br/>Another egregious error by our so-called leaders, executives and people-in-charge. <br/><br/>We really have become hard-hearted in this country. Coupled with having no sense, that is a dangerous combination.<br/><br/>Fight On!, Junior and Sydney!

326532
<br/>Why is it that the NFL highlights the wrong issues lately?  The Junior Seau story is more important and meaningful than any Tom Brady headline.  <br/><br/>Thank you NYT for publishing this story.  Fantastic job Sydney - your dad would have been proud!

Who is calling the kettle black? Erickson has been quoted in Huff Post lately with the most disgusting remarks about women. He should know all about disrespect for women! I am laughing at the hypocrisy of all those men on stage. Proud of defunding health care for women. Proud that fetuses trump a woman's life. Proud to bow down to the Pope on birth control. Proud to refuse to make men lazy about their using birth control instead. Proud to let people drop anchor babies in our economy in its already poor shape. Proud to say the government needs to bring in the FBI and the National Guard on anyone associated with ending a pregnancy. Pride, Puritanism, and Hypocrisy will kill the Republican party. The Republican Party is killing itself like out-of-control cancer cells do the human body.

One percenters changing the laws? So true. Obama is a one percenter!

Along with all the excellent points made by other commenters, there is this:  mis-classification of marijuana engenders a general disregard for other laws; if the government can be so wrong about this issue, how are they to be believed in other instances?  I am an over 60 basically law-abiding citizen, yet have violated the prohibition regarding marijuana since college in the 60's.  "Hands up - don't shoot!"

Is Maya Jasanoff related to Sheila Jasanoff? <br/><br/>I took classes taught by Sheila at Cornell - she was expert on science, technology and society.<br/><br/>If so, the apple has not fallen far from there mother tree!<br/><br/>Great work.

Is there a middle ground here? Can I chose to not get vaccinated for the flu while pregnant without you assigning me the Scarlet Letter? Just because I am not first in line to receive every single dose of every single vaccine ever created, does not make everyone an 'anti-vaxxer'. I am not anti-vax but I am certainly not going to get immunized during pregnancy (see my global post above.)<br/><br/>I hope you are current on every single booster and check your titers regularly. I would hate to reverse the hypocritical label back to you! You may be just as much the Boogie Man as those hated 'anti-vaxxers'...

Sounds delish, but cooking small clams for 20 minutes?  No!  It's just plain wrong to say that clams take longer to cook than mussels.  A mussel will not be completely cooked when it starts to open- and an undercooked mussel is icky- whereas a clam is delicious raw, and if you're cooking it in the shell, you want to cook it as short a time as possible- just until the shell starts to open- so it doesn't get too rubbery.   Note that Sam Sifton's recipe in today's Magazine section calls for hard shell clams to be steamed for only 10 minutes. 

327336
Does anyone not see the ridiculous and hypocritical bias here?  Trump is being raked over the coals for stating his honest and candid opinion about his treatment by Reporter Kelly. While Bill Clinton was given a free pass with his horrid treatment of an intern while in he Oval Office conducting "business!"  Clinton's behavior was way more abhorrent to me as a woman than Trump's statement about Ms. Kelly. And don't even get me started on Hillary "standing by her man" through all of it in an effort to further her political career.

Did MELanie reveal herself in MELt? :) She did manage to work HIRE into the puzzle itself, apropriate for a HELP WANTED puzzle, no? Several nice clues: rolling in the dough for YEAST, <br/><br/>I didn't like FLIPTHEBIRD for pilot merely because I was stretching to get from bird to plane, that is, unless Melanie meant some reference to the THUNDERBIRDS? Sure enough:  FLIPPING THE BIRD! <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsVPXMatV3Q" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsVPXMatV3Q" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsVPXMatV3Q</a><br/><br/>Nice effort for a first timer, but not devoid of c'mon's!!  I wasn't entirely thrilled with HEARKEN as an alternative to HARKEN, only because a) it just feel right b) it cost me &gt;10 seconds for that. And HOUR for the XX in XX:YY? Who writes it that way, isn't it HH:MM? One of those "true but not helpful" challenge clues.

What differentiates my neighborhood? Education, education, education and HARD work.  We have a diverse school population with broad income dispersion.  What is the difference between the low performers and high performers?  Those that want it  - work for it.  The worst performers are inevitably the low income kids from black and hispanic homes.  Our school scores reflect it.  Every kid at our school gets the same treatment -- no special preferences -- except for the low performers. A large percentage of our budget goes to extra tutoring for these children.  Yet these children continue to underperform.  But the kids whose parents understand the value of an education make sure their kids do their homework and are at school every day.  They make education a priority in their child's life.  Income doesn't have to define you life but making education a priority certainly does.<br/><br/>Want to make a better life for yourself -- stop having kids with different daddy's and parading boyfriends through you children's lives!  Want some tough love -- your lifestyle contributes to your problem.  Social welfare  enables poor people to propagate like rabbits with no consequences. My neighborhood will not and should not support low income house holds.  What is the point of working hard to live in a great neighborhood when other people can defy social and educational norms and achieve the same lifestyle.

narcissism first ? - I liked Oprah's story on a final David Letterman Late Show - on crowded Selma bridge a woman called across the pressing crowd 'Oprah - can I get a selfie with you !?' - Oprah was willing but the crush prevented them getting closer - Oprah finally called out 'can you just take a photo of me ?' - the woman promptly huffed/sniffed 'I don'wan a photo of YOU ... !'

327665
so we got seflie policing now?! give me a break. selfies are fun and affordable, anyone can do it whether you're rich and famous or a faceless person in the crowd. if you hate it don't look but I'd bet you're looking

As has been said before where's the ethical issue here?   The writer was throwing this stuff away!  She sold the good stuff.  Now she is upset that someone else is selling the left overs.  And by the way how does she know that this neighbor doesn't need the money....<br/><br/>Just because she is annoyed that she couldn't sell the stuff doesn't mean the person who did is unethical.

Al Gore’s Climate Reality? Dismal viewcounts; nobody is watching<br/><br/>Anthony Watts / 2 hours ago August 9, 2015	<br/><br/>Tom Nelson pointed out something quite interesting on Friday August 7th. He wrote on Twitter:<br/><br/><a href="https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/tomnelson-gore-views.png" title="https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/tomnelson-gore-views.png" target="_blank">https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/tomnelson-gore-views...</a><br/><br/>I thought to myself, “how could this be?”. Gore spent millions on a professional set, hired a leggy spokesmodel to emcee, spent  huge amounts of money on web advertising, and claimed he had millions of views during the event.<br/><br/>And yet, only 166 views of his flagship YouTube interview?<br/><br/>Well, it’s up to 179 as of this writing, so I guess that’s something. I figure skeptic Tom Nelson’s tweet helped a bit.<br/><br/>al-gore-video-counts<br/><br/>You can watch Gore’s video here. I’m sure he’ll appreciate some views from Climate Skeptics.<br/><br/>Note some of the other viewcounts I highlighted at right in yellow from the 24 hours of climate reality. They have similarly dismal numbers.<br/><br/>Now, look at the bottom two I highlighted. One is from my friend John Coleman titled: “How the Global Warming Scare Began” All John had was one TV station in San Diego and a mention on WUWT.  He’s got 294,263 views. Physicist and climate skeptic Freeman Dyson has 14,357 views and the video is handheld VHS quality!<br/><br/><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/08/09/al-gores-climate-reality-dismal-viewcounts-nobody-is-watching/" title="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/08/09/al-gores-climate-reality-dismal-viewcounts-nobody-is-watching/" target="_blank">http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/08/09/al-gores-climate-reality-dismal-vi...</a>

Is that the same CWA that was founded by the employees of AT&amp;T? The one that watched 200,000 employees lose their jobs after 1984? The one that didn't help a single employee with a deferred pension (small) add one cent to that pension for 30 years after they were laid off?<br/>Yep! I'll bet it is that one.

What barriers? She's on Medicaid if she is a welfare mom with 2 kids! She gets 100% free Medicaid with no copays, no deductible, no premiums!<br/><br/>She gets 100% free birth control -- every type -- sterilization to the Pill and IUDs.<br/><br/>She doesn't need Planned Parenthood -- she can go to any OB-GYN or clinic or family doctor and get this.<br/><br/>Obviously this woman WANTED her illegitimate kids and her "baby daddy", so she could have her cake and eat it too -- live with the father of her children, but still get a welfare windfall.

Why do we fight today? We fight for resources, and we fight for land, as they did in WWII, and those unfortunate people who reside upon the land, which is the source of the desired resources, are through various propaganda techniques always turned into untermenschen before they are ground into the soil by the superior power.<br/><br/>Today the Middle East has become a charnel house, because the curse of the oil beneath the ground, has been visited upon the people who inhabit the land. We have been taught to hate the Persians, and of course not to trust them, because they are a rival power, which has geographic centrality to highly coveted European and Asian Markets. The Sunni Royals have spawned haters of Third Reich Intensity, whom they call Takfiri, they are tasked with the defense of the realm of oil, but we have named them terrorists.<br/><br/>Israel of course is involved in its own Anschluss fur lebensraum. The Arabs are the new Semitic untermenschen. <br/><br/>The American People have been taught to dance to a Corporatists agenda, which creates deliberate chaos in order to secure the future opportunities which arise from war. American Exceptionalism is used as a whip to drive our people to do things, which we should know are wrong, but then we are the superior, and they are the inferior, so we fall into line and pony up for empire with our taxes. Sadly, we with great pride supply the boys to meet the butcher's bill. They are our heroes! Nothing has changed since WWII, has it?

Brand: How do you figure?! The minimum wage is much higher in most Canadian provinces and there's much more social mobility there than here, now. An increased minimum wage is correlated strongly with social mobility. In some American cities, the minimum wage has not gone up nearly enough to match the increase in the cost of living.

So, can I call these "researchers" what they truly are (editors permitting), money grubbing whores whose only concern is making money for themselves?  When their "positions" are scientifically refuted, can all the folks families who died from excess calorie intake from sugary Coke sue them personally and their Universities who back this very questionable "research"?<br/><br/>This is wrong on so many levels that I have to believe there will be some justice in the end.  God save our nation!

G, who can be "outside exercising the entire day"?  Most folks have to work, many  raise a family, care for elderly parents or other relatives, manage a home, some do volunteer work, etc.  Perhaps you have no obligations or responsibilities?  Lucky you!

Why is The Donald so appealing to so many of us? Because he's honest and blunt, and says what's on his mind. He's unlike all the other boring, programmed, timid lawyer/politicians who dominate both ruling parties. How many Harvard and Yale lawyers or graduates have been Presidents/First Ladies in recent decades? JFK, both Bushes, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, now Hillary Clinton. Some of these are good folks whom I admire and even voted for, but with our lousy economy, and the "giant sucking sound" H. Ross Perot warned about (jobs going overseas), Trump is successfully appealing to the fears, frustrations and anger of US voters. Many  of us are tired of empty promises, posturing, and lack of action. Trump seems like a man who will at least DO something! So did H. Ross Perot, before he was tricked into withdrawing from the Presidential race, and lost credibility when he re-entered.<br/>The US corporate establishment wants stable, predictable, non-controversial leaders so they can make long-term business decisions. But the American public is increasingly frustrated with all their jobs going overseas, with high taxes and wasteful government, and with the appearance that Congress will vote the way their large donors tell them to vote. Some Republican candidates have received huge donations from Las Vegas casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who is being investigated for possible ties to Macao and Asian drug gangs linked to his Macao casinos.

Why on earth would RM do that? She's his rising star and she did right by him. As you must know, RM and Trump loathe each other and FOX is facing a die off of its natural demographic so MK is a godsend for it.<br/> Finally, with Trump (as with Ayn Rand, another hopeless mediocrity) there's nothing to listen to,  Johnny Carson's rapt attention notwithstanding. So, moderating be damned, I wanted to see Trump savaged and he was. Go Megyn!

Why do you keep inserting liberals into what is clearly a problem for the GOP elite?<br/><br/>The Democrats aren't divided; it has light blue Hillary and deep blue Bernie.<br/><br/>The GOP, on the other hand, has Kasich, who expanded Medicaid in his state, and Jeb!, who wants a path to immigration for undocumented people, alongside Obamacare repealers and fence-builders.<br/><br/>You're trying too hard, counselor.  Your party is imploding, and everyone, including you, knows it.

My God Professor K, have you learned nothing from your time with us ? ;-)<br/><br/>It's going to get much worse. And the correlation between the arguments and the poll ratings will get confusing.<br/><br/>And when the results are out, we'll be wondering how we have not learned a whit about how people vote.<br/><br/>What is new ? Nothing ! Plus ça change !<br/><br/>We can merely pray - as liberals and seculars and disbelievers - that "we" come out with the best option.

Let's take a deep look at the system: what traits did the candidates show on stage? First, they protected each other. None of them called each other on claims easily proven false. Why allow your opponents to escape unquestioned about claims that are supposedly the pillars of policy success? You do it because your commitment to mutual deception and tainted virtue is bigger then your personal commitment to integrity. It lowers national standards to enable special interests to rise. It is a demonstrated pledge to conceal the results of Republican ideas.<br/><br/>It is sad when 10 grown white men lie, even about telling the truth!  For the country it spells disaster! For the Republican Party its business as usual. Once the parties had different interpretations of the facts, now they have different "facts."<br/><br/>Chuck Todd called the debate a performance, and that it was. The reviews failed to mention they strangely lacked a vision, displaying only slogans, boasts and blame. Did you hear a plan for a better system of health care? A plan to improve schools? A plan to grow jobs not tied to tax cuts and lower wages? Real help for the poor?<br/><br/>If you listened you came away thinking each candidate was born fully formed and error free. There was no indication that issues have two sides. In fact there was little discussion of issues at all! Their image of America seems to be standing on an island with a megaphone shouting demands and lies while calling it strength.

Why do you think this is free stuff? As a 30+ year veteran of AAdvantage, I earned my miles via loyalty to the airline, expecting them to honor their part of the bargain. But AA, although not apparently as badly so far as Delta, has continuously whittled away the value of their end of that bargain, including both availability of and mileage cost of awards, as well as the perks associated with achieving their premium status. And that's not even mentioning the added fees sometimes in the 100s of dollars that have appeared in the last few years  to be forked over in addition to your miles!!  <br/><br/>Deceptive business practice in my opinion!

'What did the men who would be president talk about during last week’s prime-time Republican debate?' <br/><br/>the longest time for one issue -10 minutes - was spent on 'immigration' -<br/>as Trump had made the issue central to his campaign and he is the frontrunner.<br/><br/>And if people are talking about 'immigration' - and women - and Rosie - and god - and Hillary - there is very little time left for economics.   <br/><br/>As Jennifer (Mercieca) an expert in political rhetoric and communications professor at Texas A&amp;M University, says - a recent Economist/YouGov poll showed 87 percent of the nation listed immigration as an important issue and as "most important" with 10 percent of respondents. <br/><br/>'So the issue may have been just right for the crowd that gathered in the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball arena, as Mercieca saw it. "It was a noteworthy crowd in that it was responding at all," - and may I add - the loudest to Trumps 'Rosie remark' - so - it might not be 'Obama's Failure to Faii' - while certain issues or (not) mentioned - it might the blood leaving some dudes brain - and pumping to - - wherever?<br/><br/>And<br/>'WARNING'!:<br/>Part of this comment has been 'satire' - defined as 'the use of irony, sarcasm or ridicule to expose - denounce, or deride vice, folly, etc.' - AND a test for NYT moderation.

What are these police thinking?!  Where is the training?! You cannot fire upon a black man when he fires upon you or when he is engaged in anarchist activities!!

How about Congress (do nothing and never there) and corporations start leading the way with responsibility? Corporations do all they can to avoid paying taxes. Twenty-five percent of profitable companies, like GE, pay nothing! <br/><br/>Reigning in lavish salaries for the C Suite and the coaches is also needed. The salaries for tenured professors is nothing like you are lead to believe. Their graduating STEM and MBA students' starting pay is much higher on average than the professors who teach them.

"Honestly, who cares?"  I'd suggest that the principles of fairness and justice that are part of the American experiment are reasons to care very much indeed!  So: should we dismiss discussions of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as old news?  And three centuries of slavery and its aftermath is older still - is that irrelevant, too?  Our identity is larger than the scope of our day-to-day humdrum affairs.

Many years ago (30?), one of the car magazines wrote "if you want a vehicle to last 20 years, make sure it's one you will still WANT after 20 years." They were talking about having a vehicle that was fun to drive, not just one to get you from place to place - but I think this article, and many of the comments, show that we create the fun in what we do with the vehicle, and if the memories are great, then the vehicle is great, too. But then you get a new vehicle, and create new memories with it. <br/><br/>I also remember a line from a column on a Jaguar XKE V-12. They said "the speed limit may be 55 mph (remember that?) - but no one says how long it has to take you to GET TO that speed!"

And we are to expect that a White House that has pursued unparalleled surveillance of Americans, a White House waging aggressive prosecution of whistleblowers, a White House that operates in obsessive secrecy will find the proposed Pentagon  rules excessive? Give me a break! More likely the editorial board will be subject to constraints for these comments.

"an immigration system Obama has presided over and done nothing to fix?" What planet are you living on? First Obama tried to work with the Senate - progress was made, then suddenly came to a screeching halt as people like Marco Rubio decided it was better to oppose their previous positions than offend the far right by working with Obama. Then Obama tried on his own (following years of the highest deportation levels ever seen) and was greeted with howls of "tyranny!" To say that Obama has done nothing is so far from the truth as to be - well - something I'd expect to hear on Fox.

"The great Recession" GOPers handed Obama? Bunk<br/>By all measures, Cheney-Bush left Obama with two failed elective wars (un)paid for by tax cuts (mostly) for the rich- resulting in The Second Great Depression.<br/>Unlike the First- where GOPers mostly tried to help get us out, Obama was met on day one with the loudly, proudly announced campaign of "Obstruction and NO!". Despite GOP obstruction, Obama was able to convert THE Second Great Depression into what is called The Great Recession.<br/>Now, Obama is blamed for failure of the economy to jump over the Moon! At this stage of The Great Depression, we were hitting a second low, which persisted until the Second World War.<br/><br/>How quickly we forget. WHY? GOPer propaganda? Intimidated Press? Withdrawn General Population? Obama's decision not to try the war criminals? All of these?

Why do people block ads? Maybe you ought to ask instead - why do people fight against aggression and aggravation?  <br/><br/>I don't like BIG and I don't like LOUD and I don't like INVADERS.  Some big popups take over almost the entire screen.  The little "x" to close them lies beyond the edge of the screen, so it's either waste time figuring out how to close the popup or just give up and close the site.  About "loud" - early this morning the first news video I wanted to watch started with a loud scream of "Cannonball!"  That is one product commercial absolutely unsuitable for early morning hours.  After that cannonball attack, I have no memory of what was on the actual news video.  And finally, certain news sites harbor invading ads that freeze my computer, make my laptop fan whir, and force my video driver into recovery mode.  Even after I close such sites, my computer has a hangover and must be rebooted.  The invading advertisers are relentless and unmerciful - and must be stopped!

 Ross: you've got to be kidding right? "This might be an overoptimistic take"...  I'll say! What a sorry bunch of losers these guys were, except possibly for Kasick.  The rest of the lot was so pathetic I kept having to leave and come back because it was making me sick.  At the end of the day, the only winner was the fox moderation team, at least by giving some tough questions to each of the candidates. The fact that none of them really ever answer the question head-on, nor did they really say anything about their policies, is very worrisome. <br/><br/> I almost felt that is this forced Commentary  tell Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, every two or three minutes having to say something that would disparage one or the other of them or more likely both of them. <br/><br/> The only thing exciting for Ross is that they spent quite a bit of time talking about abortion abortion abortion, sex sex sex, gay marriage game marriage gay marriage.  And oh by the way, not one woman on the stage.  But, that's the story of the life of the GOP's race to the bottom, And that's where they'll end up.

The Rosenbergs were guilty of anti-semitism?  Really? When all else fails then this card is played.  Please study this matter before you comment.  The prosectutorial team and the judge who sentenced them were Jewish.<br/><br/>Of course they died for their crimes!  There are very bad people out there who would weaken, destroy or subjugate us if they could -- then it was the Soviet Union, now it is ISIS, Al Queda and Putin.  People with good common sense and honor carefully decided to try and condemn these traitors and spies.  They were proud Jewish Americans, and they were clearly on the right side of history given the Stalinist terror, the revolt of average people who fought and died to throw off the Soviet yoke, the millions who died in collectivization, purges, etc.

What will it take for you and the NYT to get a clue about Bernie? Bernie drew a crowd of 28,00 PEOPLE(!) yesterday in Oregon and the NYT doesn't print a word about it. This editorial blackout of Sander's campaign by the Times is very troubling. Bernie is drawing huge crowds wherever he speaks but apparently to the Times, that is not news "fit to print! Sanders is a once in a lifetime phenomenon  and all recent polls show him comfortably beating every Rebublican candidate running. Shame on you NYT for your failure to include him in your paper!

"The Defense Department’s new manual on the law of war could severely hinder the work of journalists covering armed conflicts"?  <br/><br/>A classic Times' wide-eyed naif statement!<br/><br/>"COULD hinder..."?<br/>That's the POINT: TO HINDER!<br/>To hinder, manage, and conceal news from reporters and the public!<br/><br/>And this is followed by the truly chilling statement:<br/>"Journalists, the manual says, are generally regarded as civilians, but may in some instances be deemed “unprivileged belligerents,” a legal term that applies to fighters..."  <br/><br/>“UNDERPRIVILEGED BELLIGERENTS"?<br/>We've come to a point where the "security" apparatus claims the right to see journalist and average US citizens as threats, to be deemed 'unprivileged belligerents' as they (the spooks) see fit!    <br/><br/>What an utterly chilling state of affairs for anyone who values truth--or freedom--for that matter!<br/><br/>And editorial concludes with the lame, "the White House should call on ... Carter...to revise this section"?  <br/><br/>Where's the Times outrage and indignation?  <br/><br/>This is a basic assault on our freedoms and journalistic integrity!  The Times--and everyone--should be castigating the very mid-set that permits such a document to be drawn up.  THAT'S the real issue here.  <br/><br/>The rampant paranoia, untrammeled assault on basic US freedoms, and contempt for the people of the USA and our media by the 'security' arm of "military industrial complex" is the a much greater threat to our nation and its traditional values than any of the stated foes.

But Dr? If you use Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: 25 to 54 years (One of your favorite measures!). it tells a completely opposite story!<br/>Under Reagan, the rate goes from  78% to  83% when he left office. And under Obama the rate goes from  83% to  80% today.  Things are just not as rosy as that top line number say they are.

Did you read the Justice Department's analysis of the Ferguson police department? You should -- before commenting with such confidence that this doesn't happen. It absolutely does.<br/>A great example from NYC was the Bronx narcotics officers (Stephen Anderson et al.) who planted drugs on something like 150 innocent young people before they were finally caught. (When the young people protested, they were never believed.) The narcotics' officers excuse: they were rewarded for hitting arrest quotas. So whenever they caught a drug dealer with drugs, but didn't catch the buyer, they would simply turn around and plant the drugs on someone and say that the other person was the buyer. Then they'd have arrested twice as many people!<br/>Rewarding officers for the amount of people they bring in or the money they bring in happens all the time.

I miss the reasoning for people not being in favor of public higher education? You must also think: why stop there? Let's also stop the govt. subsidize on public high, middle and pre-k education! This plan and any that offers free higher education is doing one thing: leveling the plane field among universities with ballooning tuition (profit) that no serious manager of any endeavor would approve. After attending a private university, receiving a STEM degree and not once missing payment in almost a decade, even paid far more to get ahead, i can attest that student loan debt is barbaric, opportunistic and shameless. I recall being offered only high interest loans pass sophomore yr. My debt is down to 32% but I was a lucky one to have had consistent and decent employment in my field of study. Why I chose a private school if I couldn't afford it back then? Not because i was lazy or ignorant (mind you my grades got me accepted to a private STEM university). But because like many other before me, that's the lesser evil decision a smart, middle class member of our society with few options would take to get ahead in life: by attending a difficult and respected university. That's the American dream is it not? With a plan's like HC's to promote more options in higher education for all, I believe the quality of education should also get better, and society would realized that a middle class high achiever would compete just as well in the work force against the so called ivy graduates.

Donald Trump's campaign, from a Canadian's perspective? If we survived the crack smoking Mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, America will obviously be smarter and dodge the Donald before he lands the job of leader of the free world. What is frightening, nonetheless, after living through a crack smoking mayoral rule of Toronto, the capitol of Ontario, the province in which I live and love? (infotainment at it's best!) Trump may be a poor comparison to Rob Ford, but he has an astonishing swell of support in the Republican polls, so to lightly call  "the campaign..infotainment...a reality show disconnected from reality" negates the polls and dismisses the scary amount of people who actually agree with Trump's perspectives as they are spewed across Twitter or on the news or elsewhere. The polls show that underneath one presidential candidate stands a group of supporters who potentially identify with Trump's tactics, "repulsive remarks", perspectives and ever-shifting ideologies, regardless of the obvious lack of substance behind his speech. Trump: a poor comparison to a crack smoking Mayor, but a swell of support: can't believe people are buying this "brand".

How about addressing the fact that some students are pursuing majors that will leave them waiting tables at restaurants or in jobs that pay below the median wage in this country? There are so many stories of college students who take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt to major in art history and eventually end up working at Starbucks because they couldn't find a job related to their major. Why should the taxpayer (wealthy or middle class) subsidize such frivolous degrees? If you like art, make art history a minor or do a dual major, but at least get a degree in a field that has good job prospects. This is called personal responsibility and thinking about your future!!<br/><br/>It amazes me that politicians and pundits always ignore this aspect of the college education system; they just want to give everyone, regardless of degree, intelligence, or aptitude, a free ride in college.

What exactly is wrong about all lives matter? Why do Blow &amp; others convolute that into disrespect for Black people when it is common ground? Yes! We all matter. Do they think whites, Latinos, Asians, Russians, &amp; the rest of our diverse population are all closet racists?  Do they really think people who are not black don't matter? That attitude will insure that the system will only become more obstructive to justice, what are we all to do in the face of such broad stroke, mean spirited assumptions?

Where does the NY Times imply racism? Tellingly this article doesn't specify the race of the officers, but you have assumed it for some reason. How does robbing a convenience store make the "unarmed teenager" description inaccurate? Who is "us"? I have so many questions!

My Question: why is Jenner telling the producer to get all footage together and all the receipts and sending them all over the Ellen DeGenerres to pay for that young gal's Nursing School? ----why oh why didn't Jenner,who is worth over $100 million, just open up his checkbook and give the money to that poor nursing student himself? My goodness, all that drama and Jenner crying, and then passing the buck to Ellen Degeneress? People are being made to feel sorry for this person, every single day! There are so many people on this Earth that were horribly hurt their whole lives. Jenner is a white male, of a priviledged class, whom in the past hurt lots of people (ex wives, children, etc) for over 35 years! And please don't say that Jenner cries because of his hormone treatment! Non-Transgender women in this World, have hormones raging all over their bodies their entire lives, but they don't cry every 20 minutes like this! Women quickly learn that in order to be taken seriously they have to keep a check on their emotions &amp; BE STRONG, every single day of a woman's life! Jenner keeps saying on his show that "this Girl thing is hard", as he fumbles through his closet showing his stepdaughter for example, all the clothes GIVEN to Jenner by Tom Ford, Diane Von Fustenberg, etc. WOW. So much to cry over! And then making statements about his PAPARAZZIs following him? Well what did he expect? He knew this before he came out.

Honey, you do know that Star Trek was not only fiction?, but a TV drama -- written by scriptwriters who knew very little real science -- and that the Enterprise apparently ran on vacuum tubes (they exploded every time something went awry -- also when they hit things in the vacuum of space, everyone fell out of their chairs).<br/><br/>A real starship like the Enterprise would run entirely on computers, if anything more intrusive than what we contemplate now.<br/><br/>Frankly, I am 59 and I am beginning to be really glad I won't be around to see it. It used to make me sad. Now it makes me relieved!

And why did the candidate do nothing about this important issue when she was in the Senate? This issue needs action, not "Hillary-Come-Lately" speeches.  Mrs. Clinton was twice in a position to do something about it, having won a Senate seat in 2000 and 2006. She did nothing. And she didn't even finish second her term in office. What were Mrs. Clinton's accomplishments in the Senate, aside from the dubious vote to support the Cheney/Rice/Bush war of choice in Iraq? I would love to be convinced but merely raising questions gets one an onslaught of "Hillary-Basher!" charges.<br/><a href="https://emcphd.wordpress.com" title="https://emcphd.wordpress.com" target="_blank">https://emcphd.wordpress.com</a>

<br/>From this essay: "Can we really draw a bright line between a person who has casual sex, in private, with various lovers, and a person who has sex in private, with various short-term and long-term lovers, from whom she accepts monetary support? "<br/><br/>No, and nobody says we can, or should do so, either, except for people like Ms. Shrage, who, in a sense, is looking at helping write what would have to be Federal legislation, enacted by Congress and defended by the Justice Department. Such a thing isn't going to happen in this, or any other decade, in American culture, so the whole thing becomes an academic exercise, fitting for a person who is a philosophy professor. Law is always done on a case-by-case basis. It has to be. <br/><br/>Did you ever hear about the two Zen disciples who were in the courtyard of the monastery. One said, "Suppose there is a live goose in a huge bottle with a narrow neck on it. How could I get the goose out of the bottle alive without breaking the bottle?" The other said, "Well, we would have to shrink the goose by starving it". The first student said "But that would kill the goose..." <br/><br/>At that point, the Zen master, who had been listening to the 2 students, approached them, clapped his hands together loudly, several times, then said, "There, the goose is out of the bottle! Now, go fetch water and firewood, like I asked you to do!"

Why are ALL the police officers white??!!

Why do we consider immoral for a woman (or a man) to earn money by performing sexual acts, but have no trouble accepting that women (and men) are coerced every day and in large numbers by poverty to engage in a<br/>various unpleasant activities, such as flipping burgers, working in mines or in dangerous toxic environments? People "sell their bodies" every day for low paying wages without any form of moral outrage. Poverty is a highly coercive condition. When are vulnerable poor people protected from the necessity to undersell their bodies and minds for extended portions of their lives? But if a person decides to take advantage of the body and of the desires of others to earn a more significant pay, God forbid! Then this person becomes a sinner and a felon and can be prosecuted for the crime of prostitution. Where is the justice in this?

Huh? This column suffers from the same muddle-headed thinking that has seized a representative sample of American voters. There is a difference between a first time female candidate ("Crazy idea!") and actual insanity. Hers, or the electorate's. <br/><br/>Likewise, though one could speak positively about the qualities "outspokenness" and "fearlessness" --in a politician,  in Donald Trump, these are not attributes to be admired. The trouble is that some Americans are so starved for something which seems unscripted, they're ready to embrace Trump. <br/><br/>Let's just get off the crazy-train already. We're talking nonsense.

Which folktale does this test BEST evoke?<br/><br/>a.  Three Billy Goats Gruff<br/>b.  The Fisherman and His Wife<br/>c.  The Emperor's New Clothes<br/><br/>If you answered (b) congratulations, you may go on to fourth grade!  Both are wholesome folktales have talking animals and husbands wanting to please their unreasonable wives.  If you answered (a) you need to go to summer school  -- what do they have in common but talking animals?    If you answered (c) I'll bet you were thinking the "test" was as reality based as the new clothes of the emperor.  But you did not READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY.  The Emperor's New Clothes is not a folktale proper, but a short story written by Hans Christian Anderson (and don't argue that it was inspired by a folktale.  He changed the ending and put his name to it).   So stop being a smart aleck.   And now we have to go and downgrade the evaluation of your teacher . . . .

What the Hello??? I love anything to do with Hamilton and Washington (well almost anything obviously after this) and am even studying in college about these men as well as all history from the American Revolution era. This however is just silly. hip-hop and what else Rap to tell of Hamilton's life?? I just stared in slack jawed horror at even the images of this little own the demoralization of the time period. Individuals wiggling across the floor on her back like that one girl was not to mention the dance routine's period. Gah!! Thank you guys so much for posting this. Now I have to go back to class and tell my professor that I've been bombarded by images of an ignorant rendition of history. The only, ONLY thing I can say is at the least IF they are being true to Hamilton's history then maybe American's can finally see one of the greatest men of our country, who made the bank, and fought his was from nothing to be Washington's right hand man in the war.

Why would you be afraid to have your children around an unvaccinated child or two if your child is vaccinated?  It's not like all the unvaccinated children in a school are all in the same grade or classroom.  Would you let them out in public among all the "unvaccinated" adults? Because adults certainly haven't had nearly as many vaccines as are required by schools today!

Why pick only on Germany? <br/><br/>Is it because history is written by the victors?<br/><br/>What about the rest of Europe and America whose act of genocidal violence against indigenous groups frequently occurred in the Americas, Australia, Africa and Asia with the expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires, and the subsequent establishment of nation states? Was it because the millions massacred were considered children of lesser God?<br/><br/>During the American Indian Wars, the American Army carried out a number of massacres and forced relocation of Indigenous peoples that are sometimes considered genocide. The Sand Creek Massacre, which caused outrage in its own time, has been called genocide. General John Chivington led a 700-man force of Colorado Territory militia in a massacre of 70–163 peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho, about two-thirds of whom were women, children, and infants. Chivington and his men took scalps and other body parts as trophies, including human fetuses and male and female genitalia. <br/><br/>In defense of his actions Chivington stated, "Damn any man who sympathizes with Indians! ... I have come to kill Indians, and believe it is right and honorable to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians. ... Kill and scalp all, big and little; nits make lice".

Education like war seems to bring out the worst in us, I wonder why? Everyone on the liberal side of the spectrum acts like a college education is mandatory and on the conservative side like its some weird kind of affectation only those on the coasts should persue. <br/><br/>The question not asked by either side is why is all this post secondary education even necessary? Certainly not for the jobs most graduates will perform. Maybe we could dig a bit deeper to see that really college is an expensive filtering mechanism for the few and decreasing opportunities to join the middle class. A lottery could do that much more effectively and without the student debt!

Susan,<br/><br/>Carbon is a pollutant? <br/><br/>Carbon is fundamental for life. Carbon's properties make it a key building block for many natural and man-made materials. By mass, it is the fourth most common element in the universe, as well as the second most common in the human body.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon</a><br/><br/>Obama's video makes no sense. It suggests that Carbon is toxic, similar to Sulfur, Arsenic or Mercury.*  It outrageously claims that energy bills would be reduced and that jobs would be created with implementation of anti-CO2 measures. <br/><br/>*Aside: perhaps this explains why EPA workers in Colorado carelessly released millions of gallons of contaminated mine sludge to nearby rivers. / sarc off<br/><br/>Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is fundamental for plant growth; indeed, for life itself.

What is wrong with Hillary bashing? Truly. She is running to be the  president of the United States of America. A little scrutiny is in order. Normally this is done by primary debates, but that is not possible in this case. Obama vs Clinton=27 debates. At this time in the last election cycle we had already had 4 debates. There will be 6 debates, but they are set after! the registration deadline in mid October for many states, NY being among those. So those seeing the candidates for the first time in debate with each other, and wishing to change party registration to vote will be unable to. The candidates were forced to agree not to take place in any debates outside of the officially set 6, or they would be disqualified from taking part in them. This is unprecedented in the history of the Democratic party. The head of the DNC is a friend and former employee's of Clinton.

More extreme? To be in line with most of the other first world countries? His Policies are leaner, more effective, and not covered in corporate bloat that cost our government (us) even more. The pay-to play plan will give the financial institutions a risk free! profit, that are guaranteed by the state taxpayers (us), as they are the ones who fund the universities! Frankly, this is corrupt.

The trouble is that these models seem to have "found" a voice because it's fashionable - and, boy, does it get them more attention (and money?)! If activism became passe tomorrow they'd quickly be against activism.<br/><br/>Beauty and brains aren't exclusive but hijacking a cause to earn followers or money will get people to dislike you - regardless of how pretty you are. Not all these models (or other people) are doing that but spend a little time backstage and you'll see why this article bothers people.

What happened to the Google Chairman, Eric Schmidt? IS he out - no mention at all....<br/><br/>Google is smart to organize this way - the CEO should not be running day to day Google business but rather overseeing the CEOs of each company in it's portfolio and of course strategic vision and acquisitions. Is a comglomerate stye management the way to go - as this artical adroitly indicate - probably not but it's a way of managing a hodgepodge of disparate businesses. Google is invaluable for it's high quality free (sic) products that millions and perhaps billions of users soon to use and depend on daily. Best wishes for more Google inovation!

Andrew Jackson is easily forgotten, he was one of the worst presidents in US history but Thomas Jefferson?! He was a great man and a flawed human being like all humans. In your rush to appeal to every possible social justice concern, you would do well to recognize the fact that whether from a hypocrite or not, a good idea is a good idea.

Why do you say it's been overvalued?<br/><br/>"China's monthly trade surplus hit a record $60.6bn (£40.3bn) in February, as exports grew and imports slid back.<br/><br/>"Exports were up 48.3% year on year to $169.2bn, and imports dropped by a fifth to $108.6bn, said the country's General Administration of Customs."<br/><br/>This doesn't sound like an overvalued currency to me!

When was the last time you tried to subdue a 6'4" 300-pound individual? If you were walking late at night and were attacked and overpowered by someone the size of Michael Brown, would you defend yourself by any means necessary? Police don't have to wait until they are lying unconscious  on the ground left vulnerable to their surroundings. There is so much arm chair quarterbacking of cops today and so much ignorance that goes along with it. If you think you can do a better job, by all means put your money where your mouth is. Until then, you are the one being the coward!

Instead of funding junk science studies to deflect blame from junk food, why doesn't Coca Cola open up a chain of fitness centers if they really believe in what they preach?<br/><br/>Make the memberships FREE and make up for it in soda sales in these fitness centers. Or have a paid membership and give away the sodas in these fitness centers!

When you have one (black) President who is a Democrat against a Congress that is Republican and refuses to work with him, how can you blame Obama for 8 years of leadership widening the gap between rich and poor?  The gap has widened because of deregulation of various industries enriching the pockets of a multitude of corporations and financial institutions and the systemic lowering of taxes (on the rich especially) at all levels of government, not to mention the waging of useless and endless wars.  Lots of blame to spread around.  Do you think we'd be in better shape if we'd had another 8 years of W?!?<br/><br/>I was a high school teacher.  There is a cultural, societal dumbing down of the populace at work where intelligence is denigrated by society as a whole.  You cannot send these kids off to school and expect teachers to fix the broken closed minds you give them.  And you don't deserve an A for seat time!  <br/><br/>Start by valuing learning and thinking and discussing at home (turn off the television, get off the blue screens) and then as a society, we can discuss the best  way to educate and pay for it.

Isn't it interesting that the adolescents and radical capitalists who adore Rand always see themselves in the preposterous heroes? The "self-made" men (i.e., those with every advantage in life) who power their way through the detritus of society? <br/><br/>You have to wonder if anyone ever reads Rand's sociopathological tirades and, reflecting on her depictions of ordinary people (the "losers", the "rats"), says, "Hey--wait a minute! That's me!" There might be fewer Trumps and Ryans in the world if they did.

Did you see the play "Master Class" which was about Maria Callas teaching a class to opera students when I imagine she was past her prime?  I know NOTHING about opera so I was able to really enjoy that play.  Just wondering.  I hope there isn't too much singing in the movie - I imagine it is more of a psychological portrait.  I'll take a wait and see attitude on that one. Thanks for your response!

Do you work 40 hours a week? Do you know when you'll be working? Are you well compensated for being on call or do you work for free when you tele-commute? Are you sent home without pay if it's slow or required to clock out but remain on the job site just in case there's an influx of customers? This article isn't about high tech industry or white collar workers being on call. Everyone knows that there are certain industries that require this. It is about places like Wal-Mart, McDonalds, Home Depot and other lower wage employers who schedule work hours so erratically that you don't know when you'll be working or even IF you'll be working any given week.<br/>Sorry, this article isn't about you!

You got yours, right Joe? So the heck with everyone else! <br/><br/>You must because you have blinders on when it comes to so many other in this world. You must not have teenagers who work summer jobs, or young adult kids trying to get started in a career. This kind of work life is not only common, but rampant -- and quickly becoming the norm, not an occasional exception. Just open your eyes for God's sake, man, and look around right where you live. These people working in these conditions are everywhere in the stores, restaurants, and other businesses you frequent.

What causes recessions? When interest rates are artificially lowered by government action below their "natural" rate as decreed by the free market, it stimulates investments that would otherwise not be made and which would not be profitable at higher, free market rates. Unless trees can grow to the sky, this practice of monetary (viz., interest rate) manipulation cannot be sustained forever. When rates return to normal market rates (or above), those investments induced by the low rate, which stimulate a boom or at least a seemingly robust economy--particularly in non-consumer industries, become unprofitable and are liquidated. Voila, recession! <br/><br/>Q. How long can artificially low interest rates be sustained? How deep does the Fed want the recession to be?

And I thought the focus of this article was on the events behind the flashpoint(?!) in Watts and places like Ferguson.<br/><br/>You should read Professor Theoharis' work on Rosa Parks. You'd learn that Parks was selected for her "palatability" as a meek and mild black woman the media could get behind as a victim of Jim Crow. Your singling out Michael Brown as  a "thug" while turning a blind eye to  the racist emails sent on Ferguson municipal servers and the town's revenue scheme built around fines and court fees imposed on African Americans for minor traffic and ordinance violations makes Theoharis' point for her. <br/><br/>Here, find the villain in this picture of school girls protesting being sent to trailers for class instead of desegregated schools (I'm afraid most will find a way):<br/><br/><a href="http://63boycott.kartemquin.com/blog/boycotter-stories/a-history-of-willis-wagons/" title="http://63boycott.kartemquin.com/blog/boycotter-stories/a-history-of-willis-wagons/" target="_blank">http://63boycott.kartemquin.com/blog/boycotter-stories/a-history-of-will...</a>

“Fur unsere Heimat?!”<br/><br/>“For our homeland?!”<br/><br/>Dear Roger, the people who truly believe in God don’t have a homeland. The world is their homeland and they love all the people equally.<br/><br/>Are you really going to hate and try to kill anybody outside of Germany just because your Kaiser directed you so?<br/><br/>Are you really going to expel some natives from their homeland just because some priest wrongly understood the Commandments?<br/><br/>Are we really going to deprive anybody from their human rights just because we don’t understand the faith correctly?<br/><br/>What’s hard to understand in “Love your neighbors”? <br/><br/>How can we see any ambiguity in such a simple sentence?<br/><br/>Do we really want to trash the Commandments for the sake of our homelands and our Kaisers?!

David:<br/>Why not just go to AA?  It's way cheaper!  And it works if you live it!<br/>(PS. My own great-uncle, Joseph H. Pratt, was the first medical provider to recognize the value of group therapy for the patients. They tell the story of his noticing - one day - that his patients 'lit up' when talking with one another.  When he talked with them individually, they had lost that 'light'.  So he started to treat them in groups!)

Queen, again why do you people think anyone gets vaccinated to not endanger others?  People vaccinate to protect themselves, period.  If people cared about other people then we would not have murderers, rapists, muggings, robbings, drunk drivers, wreckless drivers, smokers, drinkers, drug users, etc.  People care about themselves so stop pretending we are in fantasy world where people are vaccinating for the benefit of others!

Jefferson does not represent what it is to be Democrat? I am a Democrat and I am stunned. Put the dinner back with the original name. Are Democrats so lacking in courage that they intend to scrub the past? You know this move is petty and immature don't you. Shall I name all the "flaws" that the present leaders have? There is not a Democrat that could write anything like that today.<br/><br/>Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence for Pete's sake.<br/>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."<br/><br/>Stop it.  Leave our history alone!

Now you have to include your mother, as well as all your friends, in all you do for YOUR wedding? So much for the event being about you and your soon-to-be-spouse! It seems all we do for weddings now is in response to the needs and wants of other people than the two who are engaged. I'm in my mid 20s and in a long-term relationship; with the fervor that grows ever more ridiculous around weddings (how many parties will I have to pay for?! Or ask others to pay for?!), an unannounced trip to the Little White Wedding Chapel in a few years sounds ever more appealing.

Hmmm, was there not a time when the people who boarded boats that were not theirs, and tossed tea into Boston Harbor?  Was there not a time when Patrick Henry exclaimed "Give me liberty or give me death!"? Was there not a time when thirteen colonies on the east coast of North America told the King of England that this oppression must end?  Did the people in these colonies make a Declaration that certain inalienable rights such as life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness been given to all human beings by their Creator, and for which governments are created to protect?  And when denial of such core rights continued for decades, did not brave people in those colonines finally said "Enough!" and were willing to fight for their freedom?  Did the Minutemen shoot and kill the British Redcoats who were sent there to keep law and order? And did not the ruling class in England label those people rebels, if not thugs?  We call them patriots and freedom fighters.  The struggle for freedom has not yet ended for certain people in this country.  Those people are not thugs either.

I assume by "entitlements" you mean social insurance programs that Americans have all been contributing to for the past five decades or so, programs such as social security and medicaid (or is it medicare?).  These dollars are spent domestically and have done wonders to keep our economy afloat during the latest corporate reign of error, bailout and ensuing Great Recession.  There is no need to cut anything from these social insurance programs at the moment as debt levels are well within historically safe levels.  I don't want to under-emphasize the role our military plays in protecting our shores, insuring international trade routes and keeping foreign investments safe, but there is so much waste in the budget that is just military-industrial social welfare that we should look there for savings first.  Then if we must we can raise the social security cap and start making those who benefit the most from our empire kick in a bit more for domestic social insurance.   Fairness!!!

Have we all gone completely ipso-nutso?  Must all Democrats repudiate President Lincoln on the basis that he was a Republican?  Who ARE these directors of public thought?  They seem to fly full speed out of the ether into the mainstream, blind-siding those of us who want to keep up, but cannot bear the current flow of utter crap that is shot at us unfiltered  at every turn. And given credibility by being un-ignored by media.<br/>   They certainly are not Historians.  They are Historiographers, re-writing facts to suit their purposes and presenting them as absolutes, or factoids.  No full context.  Just "out there."  SOP.<br/>   I know. Everyone has a right to his or her opinion.  But not to his or her own facts, wantonly strewn across the landscape (especially my break-fast table). I ache for Christopher Hitchens and Jon Stewart (already), but am grateful for the many others out there who I hope will continue to not let me down, but would be unfair to mention.  The Public desperately needs you all.<br/>And to:     Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.<br/>Respectfully:<br/>     I  wish your project to spread the word about returning what used<br/>to be called "Civics" into the classroom were better known, if indeed it continues, as I fervently hope it does.<br/>    I would be happy know more about it, and where to find that information.<br/>    Talk about being blind-sided!  My apologies.<br/><br/>    Sincerely,<br/>    pvan

So, are ads okay?  Everything is filled with ads.  You watch too much TV.  Hey it's free!  So is Google!  Except when you buy one of their phones or a Chromebook.

What paper dragon?<br/><br/>According to CNN Money, China owned $1.2237 trillion worth of U.S. government securities at the end of February, 2015.<br/><br/>So who is the paper dragon?

Please, please can't we get a national law saying that our campaign season only lasts for 12 weeks? This two years or even more is just too wearing on everybody!  Think of the amount of time, energy and money that are expended. To say nothing of how boring the whole thing becomes.  It's a ridiculous way to waste the time of the people of the United States.

Regarding question 2, can someone explain to me how it is indicated  that the hero of our story grasped his charm BECAUSE he could hear what the mouse was saying? Yes, those two sentences are next to each other in the story, but there is no causation implied. One of the oldest test-taking tips in the book--don't be taken in by proximity--seems to have been undermined here. In this case, proximity DOES a correct answer make!

The novel is dead?  My life is a novel, one that may have ended a while ago, and at the moment I am reading a memoir by an aunt past 100, which may give me some insight as to my maternal grandmother, born in Perpignan, the femme fatale of the family.<br/><br/>I am about to turn the page that says my mother, a harmless baby at the time, became very ill on their arrival in France.  What I am really trying to find out is whether there is anything my aunt is about to reveal, while I keep mum about some secrets of my own, discovered in old newspapers on the web about scandals.<br/><br/>There is a whole row of books here written by authors whom I have known quite well, like my father, an uncle, an artistic cousin, a great aunt who won an award for a scientific breakthrough before women had the right to vote, and at least seven friends and four acquaintances, but I have not read a single one of them although this is a treasure chest of richness.  I can only read in novel form.<br/><br/>It started when a friend was struggling with history at school in Paris  and I told her pretend it's a novel and just memorize the dates.  She flunked, but then she got 'coal mining resources in Germany', while I got 'Mademoiselle No. 872456, New York!'.  This goes to show that a lot in life hinges on timing and good luck.<br/><br/>There is no so thing as an original story, all have been written, but you can often find them in a novel form and with this in mind, 'Let Me Tell You', I am off to read Shirley Jackson.

Fight oligopolies?  I think you have that backward.  Look at the "reforms:"  <br/><br/>"Creditors have been pushing for changes to Greek law that would make it easier for banks to foreclose on borrowers who are unable to repay their loans...ending fuel subsidies for Greek farmers; opening all professions that are closed to competition; deregulating the energy and natural gas market; and proceeding with the privatization of major national assets such as ports, airports and the rail network."<br/><br/>These are all are give-aways to corporations.  Those subsidies no doubt help SMALL farmers.  Big Ag wants to elbow those guys out of the way.   <br/><br/>"Opening all professions": Another name for union-busting.  <br/><br/>"Deregulating the energy and natural gas market":  When has that ever lead to anything good for consumers (or people that care about the environment)?<br/><br/>"Privatization of major national assets":  Will the citizens get their money's worth here?  They never do!  And I can only imagine the horror of "Sponsored by" signs that will now hang over all of Greek's antiquities.  <br/><br/>This is nothing more than a power grab by the One-Percent to increase their wealth at Greek people's expense.

Why don't we emulate our Northern Neighbor? Canada is just a hop, skip and jump away. Yet they are so different not allowing political strife to carry on endlessly. Why don't we appreciate the things they do right and take the lead from them? Oh, I forgot! We are Americans, exceptional in every way. We are the Leaders who will never follow. For us everything bigger is better.And just for that arrogance we have to suffer endless campaigns and sound bites while our politicians morph into cartoon characters singing loony-tunes.

I wonder how many of the anti-vaccination mothers work outside the home?  When I was a child and got all the usual diseases, most mothers didn't work.  Even then, with 3-4 children, it was pretty awful being tied down at home for weeks while each child came down with the disease.  <br/><br/>Just how would that play out today?  Most employees now give a certain amount of time off and it is to be used as vacation or sick leave- employees choice.  One could go through all that leave VERY quickly with 2-3 children having just one childhood disease.  Will the gov't then have to intervene and insist on unlimited paid leave for a parent whose child has a preventable disease?  <br/><br/>Between the age of 6 and 14, I had 4 different childhood diseases, each requiring a minimum of 7-10 days out of school.  Good thing I was an only child!  My own children had chicken pox, vaccinations being available for all the other childhood diseases.  That was about 4 weeks out of my life!  <br/><br/>Of course, my 4th grade classmate who got polio missed nearly a year of school and his mother continued to have to help him until he was grown.  He walked with braces and on crutches - now in a wheel chair for years.  I remember him as such a handsome, fun-loving boy - very active.  He became a very serious boy and man.  Who could possibly take the risk of such a horrible disease with life-time consequences?  When the child becomes an adult, how does a parent justify such a choice that changed that child's life forever?

What, exactly, is being "rammed down" your throat?<br/><br/>As for labeling people, a quick glance up and down this forum and you can see it isn't the Democrats calling names.  But you let that go.  Of course.<br/><br/>Also, do you have proof of a causal relationship between a "the rightward tilt of the country" and "this sort of thing"?  I'd wager you don't, probably because that rightward tilt favors gerrymandering.  A bit of pragmatism goes a long way, certainly much further than a shrill, data-free cry of "just look in the mirror!"<br/><br/>Speaking of, the Republicans have long tried to eviscerate US history, most notably by downplaying the effects of slavery.  Seems a lot more worrisome than re-naming a dinner.  Besides, there are plenty of instances where names are purposely disposed.  You could ask Lincoln himself about that if he were with us.

Wait a minute - the prisoners are supposed to be listening for suspicious noises? Where were the guards? Shouldn't they have been checking and listening? I think this overreaction on their part is due to their feeling guilty that they let this happen. So, let's take it out on the prisoners who had nothing to do with it. It's not their fault, fellows, it's yours!

So, Bassetts USED to make chocolate marshmallow ice cream - which seems like a Philly-only flavor? (no nuts!) - and which last I heard is sadly no longer being made. It's a family favorite.

What are you talking about? Priorities?!? Committing assault and battery is the same whether you hit a fellow player or a girlfriend.  It's got nothing to do with priorities.  Are you saying it's better to hit a non-play than a player?  Or are you suggesting that if you are a football player and you have to hit another football player (i.e. teammate) make sure the other player is not a franchise player or starter so as not to impact the season?  Think before your respond!

JRM in New York, NY--What do you mean by "the family business" when you speak of the prisons in Dannemora and Auburn? Is this about the notion that the prisons support the towns? Uh, wait.<br/>Remote Dannemora, with a population under 4,000, 2700 prison inmates and 1400 officers (<a href="http://www.villageofdannemora.com/#" title="http://www.villageofdannemora.com/#" target="_blank">http://www.villageofdannemora.com/#</a>!history/c1fur) may well depend on the prison for its economic survival and have multiple members of many local families employed there, but Auburn, with a population of about 28,000, has a vibrant tourist industry connected to the Finger lakes Wine Trails and historical attractions like the Seward House and Harriet Tubman's home, as well as new business ventures and major events like the Great Race. As of 2011, the Auburn prison had about 560 officers and about 1700 inmates, with a maximum capacity of 1821 (<a href="http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/auburn-cf-report-2011.pdf)" title="http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/auburn-cf-report-2011.pdf)" target="_blank">http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/auburn...</a>. Something around 600 jobs in a town the size of Auburn doesn't sound like a "family business" to me. That's not to say that it's a lovely place; there have been reports of threats and harassment by staff as well as attacks by inmates on officers (ibid.)

Isn't Football a wonderful sport for our children to have in their lives? Such an example for their growth and development. I don't see one redeeming quality in the sport - unless we are looking to develop thugs, dishonest individuals, abusers of women, etc. etc. And they can't even control their own. What a horrible sport!!!

Arrested? Press charges? Police? <br/><br/>What are you people talking about?!?!?!<br/><br/>These men are professional athletes: competitive, tough, feisty and powerful. Heck, when I played high school football, fights would break out all the time during practice. Guys talked a lot of trash, got in each other's faces and yes, sometimes punched each other. <br/><br/>But nobody PRESSED CHARGES. Nobody CALLED THE POLICE. And absolutely nobody expected a guy to GET ARRESTED just for cracking someone in the jaw.

Isn't this the number one problem with science today? That science, above all other things, has to be one of the areas influenced by business interests. Additionally, here we are not just talking about science but more specifically, the health industry. Facts are just facts! Science is supposed to be objective about the studies that are conducted and the truth will be found. How many people will die if Coca Cola continues this campaign and actually convinces the public that they can eat all they want and whatever they want, as long as they exercise? Yes, people that commented here are right that one cannot burn off all the calories during a workout that they ate throughout the day, but more than that, food is what gives the body energy and the raw materials the body needs in order for every organ and every cell to function properly such as vitamins and minerals. One cannot exercise away, heart disease, diabetes, and strokes if they are eating a ton of food and especially if they are eating all the wrong foods. If people are actually convinced by Coca Cola's funded "scientific" studies, then we are going to see a rise in obesity and all diseases associated with obesity like hypertension and heart disease, and death.

Too much homework<br/>    When you get home from a long day, boring day of school, what do you want to do? No one wants to do homework, that's for sure! Yes, I understand that homework is to practice what you learned in school that day, but what about the kids that don't need the practice? What about the students that don't need any extra help to learn anything? Homework puts stress on us kids to do it, which is not what you want when you go to High School. You are supposed to be taking all these big exams, and then the teachers throw you extra work at home, when you could be sleeping. Teachers always say " make sure you sleep early" but with all that homework, my peers and I end up sleeping at around 1:00 in the morning. I would understand if the homework actually taught us stuff we would need in the future like taxes and how to save your money or use a credit cards, but we end up learning about stuff we don't even use in life, let alone the next school year.<br/>That's why my final rating for homework is a 1/10<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/8xe6nLVXEC0" title="https://youtu.be/8xe6nLVXEC0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/8xe6nLVXEC0</a>

An actual true narcissist??? Seriously??? No one could be more of a narcissist than Obama! The difference is accomplishments. Obama was elected twice as a former community organizer, part time state senator &amp; a two year US Senator with no legislation or noted accomplishments to his short career. Trump has built an empire and made billions employing many in the U.S. Nothing will change for the better in the U.S. until we have great, good paying jobs for all that want to work. Trump will energize the economy. Obama's job offerings are all entry level minimum wage.

Bernie Sanders is clearly afraid of protesters?  Senator Sanders has been working for the Civil Rights of blacks, Jews, and ALL minorities since the 1960s.  He’s a wimp?  Lord when will Americans get away from the Ronald Reagan cowboy image?  Senator Sanders is taking on billionaires.  He is out there while Trump hides.  No other candidate including Jeb! and his hundreds of millions of dollars in funds has brought in people as Sanders had.<br/><br/>Or do people using chainsaws to tear up the tax code or cook bacon on the muzzle of a semi-automatic long rifle more your idea of what “real men” do?<br/><br/>Did you actually see what happened when he was speaking to a small group of people who were there to hear about Medicare and Social Security?  The two #BlackLivesMatter activists literally got up in Sanders face taking the microphone away from him.  That wouldn’t happen to any other candidate as the rest all have bodyguards keeping everyone away-off the dais.  What exactly should he have done?  Wrestle the microphone back from the two women?  Instead he backed off.  Smart man.<br/><br/>What you DON’T mention is that Sanders is consistently pulling in 28,000 people and more at each speaking site without ANY billionaire backing him.

how am i supposed to look seriously at a tv journalist (megyn kelly?) who's wearing more eye make-up (two inch false eyelashes?!) than a las vegas chorus girl?  i remember back in the late 80's when i first worked in los angeles how i was shocked that the female news anchors on local channels looked exactly like the street hookers in hell's kitchen where i used to live.<br/>after all, new york city has standards.  why isn't fox news located in north dakota?  (sorry, north dakota.)

@Mark Thompson: What capital moving in? Mostly I see factory jobs moving out and this country becoming increasingly dependent on cheap Asian imports for most of the essential goods of daily life found on our store shelves. We survived WWII, when shipping lanes from Asia were cut off, precisely because we then produced most of what we used on our own. I am old enough to remember that -- old enough to remember as well when so many of our cities were known by the high quality consumer goods that they produced, making us the envy of the world. I very much miss that!

How is the sudden decline in their currency an indication that China has accepted or will accept market forces more?  That is an assumption of the author in arguing that they have accomplished two opposing goals at once, but buyers of RMB bonds and currency traders would hardly see this change as government exiting the business of currency manipulation!  Quite the opposite.  The truth is in what happens over the next year or so.  A single move can't tell you anything about the government's objectives, so your story doesn't hold.

Teachers are retiring with full salary?  Where?  In my state (MI) teacher retirement benefits (which never ever included full salaries!) have been and continue to be steadily and significantly reduced.  No one complained when I worked for significantly less pay than other professionals with my advanced degree and years of experience, but they are happy to renege on the  retirement security promised to me as the trade-off for relatively low income.<br/>Everyone says education is important, but few think it's important enough to fund.

How do I contain my absolute rage about this column without showing disrespect and antipathy towards Frank Bruni? If he truly wants to understand why fewer and fewer people want to teach, and why so many teachers are fleeing the profession after 5 years or less, Bruni should look in the mirror.<br/><br/>Few writers have been more hostile to public schools and educators than Bruni. He perpetuates negative stereotypes of our teachers. He encourages distrust of public education and accepts at face value almost any dubious or obtuse claims about the "success" of virtually any charter "school."<br/><br/>Why did Bruni ignore actual Public School TEACHERS? And did he bother to inquire with the growing number of people---educators, parents, taxpayers---who are increasingly outraged by all of this?<br/><br/>Bruni is also oblivious regarding the threat to our schools from well-funded privatization interests who see the tax dollars we pay to support public education as "future revenue streams" for their private entities---both profit and "non profit"---dubiously called charter "schools." He advocates absolutely awful "reform" policies designed to marginalize, belittle and denigrate the very people who have dedicated their lives to teaching our children. <br/><br/>Bruni has unfortunately been part and parcel of the mendacious narrative we've been hearing for decades about "bad teachers", "unprepared students" and "failing schools." And NOW he laments the teacher shortage he helped to bring about!<br/><br/>Incredible.

Do we have proof that Kris Kobach is a citizen? We need to see his birth certificate, and those of his parents and grand parents. Plus we need to confirm his relation with them thru DNA testing. <br/><br/>But even then, I would still find it hard to believe that he is really an American!

Ah, TCM's film noir choices are superb, aren't they? Not only the familiar stuff makes it into their line up, but little known gems and totally involving B list noirs.  1953's "The Big Heat" came to mind right away in relation to TD S2.  Talk about a work of cinematic art!

Well, in this country when you have parents showing their own lack of respect for the other man, what can you expect from the children?   (If you listen, you will hear the sound of one man calling another a "bum!")  Children pick this up quick.  <br/><br/>It just tickles me to listen to one man condemn another for the road, he will never, because of his own faults, travel.  (He was out in the first round!)  Reminds me of the mother who held her daughter on a pedestal to berate the young girl who found herself pregnant - "how does this happen?"  I so wanted to say, "well, first, someone must find your child attractive."  (Not, that I am promoting teen pregnancy, but what's done, is done.)  <br/><br/>Rest assured, those stoning the harlot in the New Testament, when the Good Lord says, "he who is without sin may cast the first stone" --- they were ugly, some didn't even make it to the first round -- born ugly.

Dear Mark,<br/><br/>When are you inviting me over for dinner?<br/><br/>In the meantime, a couple of quick tips.  First, the butchers at Safeway and Lucky's are happy to cut you 2-inch slabs of whatever steak they have going.  Not nearly the quality (or price) of grass-fed, aged, prime beef -- but better than the miserable, floppy 3/4" slices they sell pre-packaged.<br/><br/>Second, I use a nice trick to get char at home.  Build your fire with solid chunks of wood like mesquite or oak -- not with briquettes.  When the time comes for searing -- or from the beginning if you are using a thin cut -- place the steak directly on the coals.  Surprisingly, the steak comes off cleanly.  Maybe needs a bit of brush-off -- that's all -- but beautifully charred.<br/><br/>Thank you for your terrific columns!

At what point and how do reasonable people begin to hold denialists LIABLE for damages surely coming? If they're really so sure - the Kochs, Sen Dimhoff, etc - there's no problem, they can prove it by putting large amounts of money in an environmental indemnity fund, interest earned of course, "Just in case" needed! Because believe thousands of experts, it will be needed. <br/><br/>I believe the majority of republicans are only feigning the "it's unsettled" position. I believe most know better - I mean, the industry leaders. The ditto heads believe the red state media lies favoring coal and oil. Even the Kochs likely know better, but being sociopaths they don't really care if millions will suffer, as long as they profit.<br/><br/>To be quibbling while ecosystems are on the verge of collapse (and climate change is really only PART of how we're killing the planet) becomes criminal at a certain point. <br/><br/>Face it: Lives and livelihoods are going to be lost if we do OR don't address climate change. To ameliorate the effects of cutting back on coal Obama could propose money to miners  for job retraining. Of course Mitch McConnel won't accept nuttin' from the black president... <br/><br/>AND THE NONESENSE JUST GOES ON AND ON WHILE WE,  IGNORE THE BEST MINDS OF MULTIPLE GENERATIONS WORLDWIDE. <br/><br/>What in God's name is wrong with people?? How can these LIES and their promotion even be legal??  <br/><br/>Denialists are shouting "there's NO fire" when there IS one, and the liars masquerade it as 'free speech.'

Has it dawned on anyone yet that we are in big trouble?  There are seventeen candidates running on the GOP ticket and the most outstanding candidate is the one who speaks his mind without worry what the media says about him and he is winning!  What a platform.  Our country has become shallow and uncaring and it has left us wide open for target practice. Our servers are being hacked - why not go back to the old fashioned way of delivering secrets.  Stop broadcasting our every weakness on tv.  Let's keep our secrets secret for a change.  We gotta start doing some deep old soul searching before it's too late.

Hey Gretchen, did you flunk science in middle school?  Apparently so did Dr. Nigg.  There was no control group in his study, Soldiers not runners were the experimental group, and asking them to pick the most comfy shoe is hardly scientific and totally subjective.  Good grief!

I'd  like to ask the deniers why there's no science that supports their position? The professional deniers are paid very well to deny man made Climate Change but they're not Climate Scientists!<br/><br/>The answer is that every scientist who set out to disprove Climate Change has ended up coming to the opposite conclusion. The last one was Robert Muller &amp; the Kochs paid for the study. He rechecked the data then concluded that man made Climate Change is worse than predicted and he became a proponent of man made Climate Change.<br/><br/><a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?referrer=&amp;_r=0" title="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?referrer=&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate...</a>

A "true" article? Really 97,1%? In the cited article of John Cook (EnvResearchLetters8/2013 on 12000 abstracts only TWO THIRDS do not express a position on AGW. Among these 33%, 97%state:"humans are contributing to global warming without QUANTIFYING the contibution" (sic!)- (who would not agree on it?)-but this is not the same as "humans are contributing more than 50% of global warming (in 2007 IPCC report). Only 14% of the mentioned two third responded to querry (of Cook); 35% of them confirm they do not have definite position with respect to AGW. After Gianluca Alimonti (University Milano) in Euro Physics News/EPN 45/5&amp;6. Another example how this (scinetific) world is full of subtle ...lies together with NYT. Any  lie is of Devil (John 8:44)

Did it particularly matter that Cornel West was there? I can't say I felt any differently about the events in Ferguson, or the issues raised, by knowing that. Frankly, I glanced at the picture and didn't even say to myself 'hey, that's Cornel West!'

Have we not awakened to the fact that there is an on-going effort not merely to limit the functioning of democracy but also to hobble it, indeed even to weaken it to the point where it is virtually useless?<br/><br/>The tea party eruption adopted the idea that US Senators should no longer be elected by the people and Rich Perry said, Yeah!. They want to go back to the time when senators were selected by state legislators, taking the people out of the equation.<br/><br/>Those who  worship the first drafts of the Constitution as if they were holy writ** maintain that we are not, in fact, a democracy, but rather a republic, first and foremost. Indeed, the original document offered only a modest effort at democracy, with only the House of Representatives elected by direct popular vote. The far right would like to return to that standard.<br/><br/>So, it is not surprising the many Republicans think that voter suppression is not evil. Many see democracy as the threat and limiting the ability of people to express their views is therefore a virtue. If they get their way, we will be ruled over by a corporate oligarchy and some sort of "means test" for voting would become standard procedure. This is not a joke, nor is it paranoia. This vision for a future America is being hammered out every day.<br/><br/>**There are those who maintain that the Constitution, like the Bible, was divinely inspired and thus, its original language should be treated like the word of god. So, democracy should be limited, in their view.

Are you serious? Reason, nuanced thinking, diplomacy, international treaties have all got up and left the room. Now, everyone is Rambo, Terminator, everyone has a heavy machine gun hanging from their shoulders; and if you are hesitant to use those guns, and ask for more, you are a foreign "policy" weakling. <br/><br/>So, are you suggesting that we try to reason using logic, knowledge, strategic thinking? Good luck!

Serioulsy??!! No official birth certificate has footprints on it!! This is a commemorative certificate given by the hospital to the new parents. The hospital birth certificate is not the legal birth certificate. The legal one comes from the city of birth and has the state seal. None of my children's official birth certificates have their footprints on them and their commemorative hospital birth certificates were ruined when our basement flooded. Are they no longer citizens of the USA? I guess not according to Kansas. I'll make sure to let them know to not move there since they will be illegal immigrants in that state!!<br/><br/>What if you were born at home, in a car enroute or in a taxi cab? Are taxicab baby deliverers now required to carry a fingerprint (footprint) kit as well? Are home births illegal?<br/><br/>Are they truly THIS DUMB in Kansas? What a sad commentary on the state of education in certain areas of the USA. I thank God daily that my grandparents had the sense to settle in Massachusetts. We have our problems but at least our government is still sane!

The problem with the education system in America?<br/><br/>The more I think about it the more I just have to laugh. When people lament the problems with the educational system routinely "experts" are quoted--teachers themselves, administrators, etc. But the fact is every child who has gone to school for years and even college is valid as an expert because having grown up in the system--just as we would expect a child having grown up in a garage to have quite a bit of insight about car mechanics and gas station oversight.<br/><br/>But for all those millions of children--you and me!--no real honest discussion of education ever occurs...Why not just take the gloves off and ask every adult what is wrong--after all every adult grew up in the d*mn place. My two cents is that there is no real attempt to determine individual student capacity and interest and to align teacher capacity and interest to student. An enlightened education would be one where a variety of teachers and subjects would exist and the students would be more adequately matched to such and there would be a more clean "leading and following" process.<br/><br/>The way things are now students are taken to be all alike and a teacher is supposed to bring them all to knowledge of a subject--but precisely because all students regardless of individual capacity are supposed to be raised to a particular knowledge of subject the subject itself must be dumbed down to where all can grasp it--which is why kindergarten works but not advanced math...

One commenter has a solution: Make other countries pay for all this:<br/><br/>"If this work is valuable to other countries, why don't they pay us to provide this service? ... Hey, we could turn war into a profit center instead of costing the USA taxpayer!"<br/><br/>SPOILER: <br/><br/>Other countries WON'T pay for this service. Who would, after all, when they know the US can always be counted on to spend billions of its taxpayers' dollars to send its young men and women to die in Mideast wars? <br/><br/>What if "other countries" say this, for example: <br/><br/>"If the US hadn't invaded Iraq in the first place, looking for WMD that didn't exist and that the US had no reason to believe existed, ISIS would never existed in the first place. According to former NYT writer Dexter Filkins, nearly all ISIS commanders are former officers in the Iraqi army disbanded by the US government. You guys created ISIS; you guys get rid of ISIS. Don't come to us asking for money to solve a problem that you created."<br/><br/>What do you think we should do if that happens (though the odds of that are no higher than 99.43578%)?<br/><br/>Sign up your son or daughter to fly off to Iraq and drop million dollar bombs from $57 million planes onto $500 machine guns? Or cut our losses, bring our troops home, and do what other countries do: Spend our taxpayers' dollars on our own country?

Will Times readers be able to "opt-out" of this if they do not want the paper tracking what articles they read? It seems that the Times should have more respect for their readers privacy. Many of us already use anti-tracking software on our browsers to prevent tracking by advertisers and would be required to add similar software to our Times accounts to prevent tracking!

It hasn't occurred to you that the reason your kids thought the Great Lakes was man-made is because they were being taught by teachers who themselves are poorly educated, don't have certification, never took exams, and never learned how to "actually teach?"  These days people are being accepted into college teaching programs who never would have made the cut 10 year ago.  Why?  Because applications for such programs are down 40-60 percent!  When Republican governors pillory and belittle the teaching profession, destroy unions, demand layoffs, cut salaries, and raise health care costs for teachers and their families, there are bound to be consequences.  The chickens are coming home to roost!

"Who Threatens America Most?"?<br/><br/>How about the extreme right wing--with its assault on healthcare, Social Security, Medicare, the nation's rail system and infrastructure, public education, and the ever-shrinking middle class?<br/><br/>And/or the ever-expanding "security" apparatus, an unholy alliance of the CIA, spying, and the "military-industrial complex" that Eisenhower warned us against?<br/><br/>The jihadists wanted to attack the our way of life in the USA and look how well they've succeeded!  Most nations are destroyed not just by external; "threats" but also from within.

@ Siobhan,<br/>Who controls the media?<br/>The Media was always meant to be our protection from the events that have overtaken us in the last 35 years.<br/>It is being used against us by abusing the rights "freedom of the press" it has. I still don't quite get how it is not the central topic of discussion 24/7 that Fox news went to court and won the right to lie to us!<br/><br/>Without honest coverage and proper analysis of the facts we are lost and being overtaken by abusing the necessary trust that a Democratic Republic must rely on to function. 

350225
"Does anyone remember the book Seven Days in May?"<br/><br/>Glad you mentioned that!<br/>A classic, which I rewatched not long ago: a 'weak' president and a military-industrial complex that disdains the very concept of separation of powers which the likes of Washington and Eisenhower deeply respected--and a very timely message!<br/><br/>The main difference is that no actual coup or deposition is necessary these days, at least not a public one!  A secretive 'security state' -- armed with all sorts of spying and control powers somehow granted to it and always seizing more powers illegally -- simply takes control little by little and we've got a state of endless "threats" and a 'need" for ever more powers, ever more control, and ever more spending on "defense" to meet the 'threats'...all while the nation crumbles from within...

If Trump can't take a minor hardball question from the network most solicitous of his party, how can he possibly lead the executive branch? For those candidates who are new to the process, our government has checks and balances that often prevent the commander and chief from getting his own way.<br/><br/>Imagine President Trump seeing a Supreme Court decision that doesn't sit well with him. "Ruth, you're disgusting!"

Germany has the largest trade surplus in the world per capita, far ahead of China - should they massively strengthen the euro as a result? And by your argument, any economy which is successful with its exports should strengthen its currency so it's less competitive. Have you considered that that country's industries might just be more efficient?<br/>China's currency has been appreciating against the US dollar for the past decade to over 30 percent.<br/>Do you hear Germany complaining that China is competing unfairly against it? No. They just go ahead and upgrade their exports.<br/>The Americans tend to make products no one else wants which is why they have vast trade deficits - plus everyone is encouraged to borrow and buy what they cannot afford. Just take the example of cars: China is awash with BMWs and Audis and Mercedes, but American cars ??!!! But China is now the biggest market for iPhones. BECAUSE it is a GOOD PRODUCT! And this is an American product.<br/>The US has been manipulating its currency for several years now by printing money and lowering interest rates to pretty much zero - so called quantitative easing, which also vastly increases the money supply and devalues its worth.<br/>The latest IMF analysis estimates that the RMB is now 15% overvalued and almost the most overvalued currency in the world! which is why they have welcomed China's devaluation.<br/>So please get your facts right!

"Slavery" ??!<br/><br/>Did someone forcibly make someone take that less-than-living-wage job?<br/><br/>What you get paid (or are able to get paid) is truly what your productivity is worth.  That goes for minimum wage workers as well as the Silicon Valley software programmers getting paid six figures to the professional athletes that get paid 6/7/8 figures to play ONE game of a kid's sport.<br/><br/>If you were worth more, you could get paid more. Simple. Deal with it.

Here's the irony of all this:<br/><br/>The person who insulted women the most in last week's 2016 GOP Presidential Debate?<br/><br/>Megyn Kelly<br/><br/>As if women can't handle comic criticism, and need to be pandered to by the President, while Barack Obama pays women 75 cents for every dollar a man earns in the same WH doing the same work. Trump wasn't indicting all women when he criticized Rosie O'Donnell (who bashed him first by the way). Nor was he declaring male supremacy when he made comments about conduct by a female attorney (trying to pump breast milk during a deposition) which would have disgusted ME, and I'm a lawyer!  Finally, Donald Trump didn't even SAY what the Times, and half-witted obscure rube Erick Erickson accused him of saying and didn't even suggest it.<br/><br/>When will the news media stop jumping the shark and let voters decide who we want as the next President?

These are tragic, appalling statistics - only 30% of NYC students proficient in reading?!  In any other work setting, results this abysmal would mean wholesale replacement of those primarily responsible (i.e. teachers), with new educators actually able to teach children.  The only reason that does not happen, is that teachers' unions protect their own - their illiterate, nonnumerate pupils are pawns and victims, hostages for ever increasing spending that never, ever leads to better results.  The state should take over the entire NYC public school system, sack most of the incumbent teachers (based on the performance of their pupils), and hire new, non-union teachers of demonstrated quality (from private and charter schools, and out of state), paying superior wages for superior results.  Children are not less intelligent than a century ago, when the city's teachers managed to educate many first generation immigrants at a fraction of the (inflation adjusted) current cost, to a much higher standard of competence.  The NYC public school system as currently configured, has utterly failed, and will never be reformed from within.  Remember how Detroit was considered an insoluable problem for years and years?  The appointment of an independent manager, and Federal bankruptcy proceedings to break unaffordable union contracts, sorted things out quickly.   Before additional generations of the city's young are sacrificed, a similar solution must be imposed.

Matty, have you ever run a business before?<br/><br/>If a retailer charges more after being forced to increase to a $15/hr minimum wage, it's not because he thinks you have more money in your pocket - he's charging more to cover his (arbitrarily legislated) increased labor costs.<br/><br/>How exactly do you think retailers cover their increased costs to stay in business - i.e., when their rent or utility bills go up?  They're going to have to raise their prices!

In China, during prolonged years of famine, a common social greeting used by just about everyone was the equivalent of, "Have you eaten (today)?..."<br/><br/>In our current American crisis of governing for all, which I would describe with words including: unread, ill-informed, polarized, alienated, ultra-biased, apathetic, etc., I find myself wondering if each and everyone of us, me included, chose to heighten awareness of our need to participate in "making a more perfect union" if we vocalized the many needs we have of all to:<br/><br/>Read about the issues and be informed;<br/><br/>Understand the impact of elected officials on 1) our nation, 2) our local communities and 3) each of us individually; and<br/><br/>Use as a greeting for these times:<br/><br/>Did you read yet?<br/><br/>You gonna' VOTE?<br/><br/>What's the impact of xyz legislation/regulation?<br/><br/>Help me understand your reasoning!<br/><br/>How can we make America a "more perfect union?"<br/><br/>We all, myself included, are dismayed by the sorry state of participation of our citizenry but do little but complain about it.  Perhaps if we all started including it in our daily dialogue with as many people as we encounter - clerks at check out stands, people at our churches and in the community, taxi drivers, colleagues in our factories and offices, etc. we might just generate the "buzz" that encourages more of our fellow citizens to become more a part of a system to make America better.<br/><br/>Fixing our country takes a well-read, informed citizenry that participates in our democracy.

If any one can get an ID, then how does getting one prevent fraud, the ostensible reason for all of this ID nonsense? You have to provide a birth certificate, which may be difficult, and are absolutely expensive, to obtain, particularly if you are elderly and/or poor. Easy for you to get one? Good for you! There are over 350 million Americans and just maybe there are one or two who's lives aren't exactly like yours.

"Abandoning my President," Mr Huber? I would think that ANY member of Congress is and will be allowed to vote its conscience on so important a deal, one that could have yet consequences for the US, for Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the world at large that we may not be able to to predict let alone avoid at this time, not "even" President Obama. Or is any Democrat compelled to vote in favor of the deal, no matter what his or her opinion is? Indeed, it does look like this, because your President is not the wise and cool-headed man that he makes himself out to be, he is vindictive and mean and will go after every and any Democrat who dares to go against him.  Look at how he treated Sen. Robert Menendez! He-Obama- has to understand that  democratic leadership does mean that sometimes people do not agree with you, and vote against your plans. That is just par for the course. But then the problem is of course, that Obama the Democrat is not a democrat. And his sycophants are falling in line up till the end of his Presidency. Or do you feel that only NON-Jewish members of Congress are allowed to vote their conscience? Do you understand that some Congressmen/Senators-Jewish or non-Jewish- do not need AIPAC to spell it out to them, but do not like this Iran deal, period?

Honestly, how can anyone reasonably expect to have a meal delivered to them in 90 seconds or less (McDonald's official standard, believe it or not)?  It's unreasonable!  It's inhuman!  Such efficiency would require some kind of mechanism capable of flipping a meat patty at a precise temperature and time without fail, adding lettuce, onions, etc. and somehow conveying it to a customer!  Of course, that's impossible, right?  Back to the self-driving cars, I guess.

Where have I heard that before, FJG? "Jews controlling the government?" Those same accusations were leveled at Jews long, long before the State of Israel, or AIPAC, ever existed! Why not throw in that the Jews control banking, and the media, too, for good measure!  Ugly. Go back to your history books before you say these ugly things. And by the way, if "the Jews" control the government, seems they are doing a pretty lousy job, with all the verbal attacks on Israel coming out of the White House.

"Handling of Donald Trump Puts Fox News on the Spot" ?<br/><br/>   The Times print edition deadlines:<br/><br/>"Handling of Donald Trump Puts Fox News IN the SpotLIGHT" !<br/><br/>That's a BIG difference!  How to account for it?<br/><br/>Being "in the spotlight" seems much more accurate --and just what Fox wanted -- while there's no evidence that Fox is "on the Spot" (except maybe with Trump).  All the articles, and BBs, are abuzz with comments on how Fox asked 'tough questions' (which they really didn't!)<br/><br/>English matters, no?   Small changes in words drastically changes meaning!

$15 per hour, why so low? An apartment in Manhattan costs an awful lot of money, god forbid unskilled entry-level workers live in (gasp!) the suburbs.<br/><br/>Housing is so expensive because the City's rent control scheme allows the winning families to have a below market apartment for life. People in the right place at the right time have housing so cheap they would never give it up, even after they've prospered and own a second home in Florida. <br/><br/>Part-timers will get cut, no teenagers will be hired and robot kiosks will replace the workers who thought they'd get $15/hour. Most businesses know the 'progressive' politicians just want someone else to pay for benefits so they can take the credit at the voting booth in November. Bah!

In what world is a retired teacher receiving a $75K pension + lifetime benefits?  I just retired (not in my fifties, but sixties) and my pension is nowhere close to that amount!  In addition, my benefits are paid by me, NOT the state.  <br/><br/>AND, I did not retire because I no longer felt that I had anything to bring to the table with my teaching.  I retired for many of the reasons you have already read-complete lack of respect and autonomy, ridiculous new "mandates" every year, and a growing group of colleagues who were perfectly fine to be told what to say and when to say it,  to teach a completely developmentally inappropriate curriculum (since when is it a goal of Kindergarten to be ready for third grade testing?) and who have no confidence in their own skill set.    Last year when I looked outside my classroom and saw Kindergarten "opinion writing" samples, that's when I knew it was time to go!

What will even more money buy us?  According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, the US spends 35% more per full-time-equivalent student than OECD for primary and secondary education.  We spend more per student that Germany, Sweden, Denmark, or Ireland.  In my city of Chicago, the average CPS teacher salary is $76,000, plus very generous benefits (as well as the potential for tenure!).  Median household income in Chicago is $47k.  My feeling is that the behavior of Chicago's teacher's unions which have resisted internal reforms, use of vouchers, and creation of charter schools has done more to damage the image of teaching as a noble profession than low pay.  The internal scandals involving kickbacks to suppliers have not helped to make the organization terribly sympathetic to either the taxpayer or the new college grad contemplating teaching versus a job offer from Google.

Do you think that it's a 'good thing' that only 1/3 of students can read at their grade level?<br/><br/>At least that way, they will not be mindless drones while they live in their parent's basements or on welfare (remember to have a baby first to qualify for that!).

Good question how would we as a country define winning? I suggest wars wagged against ideology seldom end.  Wars more about one mind set (idea) come and go as another generation chooses there way of thinking as best. Then if so inclined attempt to impose  their way of thinking on others. It does not matter if the differences are about religion, skin color, economic or political systems. Here is an equation that scares me: Trump+Nuclear Weapons=MAD!

What about 60+ years of covert and overt regime change American war against Iran don't you understand?<br/><br/>America has certainly chosen to be a hostile existential enemy threat to Iran.  <br/><br/>Other than "Death to America!" what has Iran done against the American homeland or America?  The U.S. Marines in Lebanon should have been kept home. Reagan wisely cut and ran after Hezbollah killed nearly 300 of them.

Dear JSD,<br/><br/>Are you a teacher? I'm guessing not. But I am. So if you'll indulge me...<br/><br/>(i) On what do you base your claim that teaching is easier than other professions? Have you ever taught? Most teachers hold masters degrees as well as certificates in specialized areas of training. We have children in our classes from all walks of life and have to work with them whether then can read, speak English, have special needs or even a bed to sleep in at night. How dare you! And by the way, you wouldn't last a day in a kindergarten class, of this I am certain. <br/><br/>ii) Yes, we deal with clients. They are called students, parents, administrators, taxpayers. We deal with them via email, telephone, notes, and face to face, all while trying to teach your children, sometimes simultaneously. And like your clients, they're not always nice--but teachers always have to be nice. <br/><br/>iii) And as for being terminated, teachers can be terminated, and we are. Whether we are excessed because of funding, not given tenure, or just made to "resign" just like in business. Tenure only gives us the right to due process. As for my pension, I contributed to that. (How's your 401K doing?) <br/><br/>I'm a highly trained professional with 20+ years of experience and an advanced degree. And yet, your opinion is many people's opinion. But I won't let it ruin my summer. :)

JSD,<br/>Do you see a 40% drop out rate in other professions after 4-6 yrs of college to get said degree?<br/>If this thing called teaching is so easy and cushy and sunshine and lollipops why aren't you and others jumping all over this exiting career?<br/>The demand is huge right now.<br/>Try it just for a year and see how easy it is.<br/>The pay is low because America thinks like you do.<br/>It is mostly women so we can pay them 78% of what men make right?<br/>Its a "calling" they are told. Heck, they'll do it for free almost, right?<br/><br/>The only reason you are hearing about it and the complaining is because they have been under attack for the past decade. The Right is trying to steal the public funds for private schools. But you know that too don't you.<br/> The profession is being decimated before your eyes.  The thousand of needed teachers is not because it is hunky dory. They are leaving the profession for  higher paying, "easier", careers in the private sector.  The facts state otherwise than what you proclaim.<br/><br/>So  you feel your 60+ hours a wk. are longer than a teachers 60+ hrs?<br/>They fought and formed Unions and continue fighting for their rights that all workers should have but don't.  Because you don' have these rights nobody else should either. Right?  Rather build up you and yours, you prefer to denigrate and destroy somebody else who might have it better. <br/><br/>Let them do the most important job, teaching your children, the next generation that is going to take care of you!

Yes, and the value of the Dollar went up and interest rates down, how do you explain this result? It is called 'lack of demand', zero-lower bound economics, etc. I guess you have not been reading Krugman's colums/blog. Get a subscription and try them!

How could a police department, in a major city like San Diego on top of it, have it's officers using a tool on it's citizens that there is no written policy, no training on it's use or legality, not require reports on it's use to be filed, have no records on it's use negative or positive, and not even know how many of it's officer's are using it??? Yet they have the gall to say they are testing it so no problem! Problems with our police are not limited to abuse of their legal ability to use force.

"Have you no sense of decency?" Where of the men and women of courage who Like Joseph Welch challenged the demagogue Joseph McCarthy?<br/>The only way to stop this assault on the universal right to vote by the Republican Party is to publicly and continually SHAME them.<br/>This can only be done by those who can attract and hold media attention. Let the shaming begin!

353448
Would you call out your OWN Party for restricting voter rights?  Do you think that a TP/GOP Congress wants a 50 state VRA?  Of course not!  And it applies to a few states because those states have demonstrated repeatedly that they restrict the rights of their citizens to vote.  So sad that you are on the wrong side of history.

Good lord, where to begin? <br/><br/>First, the number of eligible voters lacking an acceptable ID is vanishingly small.<br/><br/>Second, we don't have a single case of voter disenfranchisement to speak of from the past three, possibly four, decades.<br/><br/>Third, if the GOP is so evil and has succeeded in disenfranchising people of color, than why do people of color - in the South no less - consistently outvote their white counterparts? <br/><br/>This is almost all too dumb to even comment on. But I guess this is what one gets when  many leftists imagine it's 1962 and that the GOP is an evil party, and when the Democratic party has to scrape even farther into the bottom of the barrel in order to maintain their majority during big, four year national elections.<br/><br/>VRA or no, the fact is this - the GOP is continuing to dominate local and off year elections because those voters pay attention, pay taxes, and don't like government corruption and incompetence. No amount of scraping the bottom of the barrel for voters so ignorant and poor that they lack an ID is going to reverse any of this. But by god keep trying! It is funny.

And your point for bringing up this non sequitor?<br/>We are not discussing the right to take pictures.<br/>We are discussing the Police detaining people then for no other reason than to test a new toy photograph them and run that photograph through facial recog software all while the person being unfairly and unreasonably subjected to this abuse remains detained. Never mind abusing the daze they put the person into by subjecting them to this abusive and UnAmerican procedure to force a DNA sample from them to boot!<br/>Have the Russians snuck in a bunch of moles onto our police forces?

@Loyd: You don't think that the government of China is run by ideologues?  Ideology, corruption and bureaucracy have defined the state ever since the last emperor was tossed out.  The U.S. is a mess but not because people who don't agree with what the government does have to worry about being taken out and shot.  Not even when Nixon was around and compiling his enemies list have I been afraid to open my mouth or write an article in opposition to government policy.  I've spent a fair amount of time in China and in the "autonomous(!) region" of Tibet and if you don't sense the Communist Party looking over your shoulder you're probably smoking something that's illegal even here. There's not much Communism left in China but it's still a dictatorship, in capitalist dressing.

It's not just Trump's outrageousness; the question remains, how do Republicans treat women?  The top 10 contenders (an exclusive club which Ms. Fiorina didn't make) showed a great value for womens' childbearing capacity, but not much else.  JEB!  Doesn't think womens' health are a national financial priority (his later retraction notwithstanding).  Good medical coverage, including birth control, is now against GOP ideology.  Carly and the others will have to go much further than speaking about Trump's misogyny to show that their leadership would be beneficial.

sharon - "Are so many that ignorant in this country that they equate a driver's license with citizenship?"<br/><br/>Yes, and they might be manning the voting booths. Could be a reason there are no recorded cases of citizenship fraud in voting. But he/she had a license so they must be citizens!

@Tuvw Xyz<br/><br/>"But to get real, how can illegal voting by non-citizens be prevented?"<br/><br/>But to get REALLY real, is there any evidence that non-citizens or other ineligible persons have been committing voter fraud?  <br/><br/>I patiently wait for proof of voter fraud of any kind from you and the mass of Republican pols (especially in the former states of the Confederacy --oh, what an odd coincidence!) who leaped at the opportunity to return to the bad old ways of voter suppression within 5 minutes of the despicable 2013 decision by SCOTUS to invalidate key parts of the Voting Rights Act.<br/><br/>Oh -- there is none?  Silly me.

Just how is forcing someone to submit his or her DNA not a violation of the Constitutional provision against self-incrimination?<br/><br/>Many years ago the F.B.I. showed me a photo they took of someone taking photos of plainclothes city cops at a demonstration seeking to block an eviction of poor tenants. Taking such pictures was considered subversive if not downright un-American. The Feds were hoping I could and would identify the photographer. I looked at the Feds with amazement, once again astounded at their incompetency, among other things. Though I would not make the identity, I certainly could. The photographer was me. <br/><br/>Little has changed in the interim, except that now both cops and citizens can amass large databases of each others pictures, simultaneously diminishing everybody's privacy and the effectiveness of legitimate law enforcement by plainclothes and undercover cops.<br/><br/>And, of course, these databases will be hacked into, photos sold online, and the zillion websites which sell your personal information will now include your photo making stalking, impersonation, the creation of fraudulent documents, and the like much, much easier.<br/><br/>Ahhh, the joys of a society whose mantra is, "If it's tech, it's progress!"

I have one question for Ross and his Republican cronies: where was your outrage at the slaughter of children at Sandy Hook? Your response to that and every firearm engendered massacre has been the same: more guns! One can legitimately argue as to when, after conception, 'life as we understand it', begins. But there is absolutely no arguing when life ended for those Sandy Hook innocents. Until you get serious about gun control, there is not a shred of credibility to your hand wringing over fetal tissue.

"Protectors of microscopic zygotes"?!? There is nothing microscopic about the livers, hearts, intestines, or limbs of the fetuses aborted and being donated/sold as is clearly shown in the videos being released by CMP.  If you're so comfortable with the "choice" and the service being available you should be able to do so while at the same time being comfortable acknowledging that what is being crunched up, pulled apart, and sucked out is more than a microscopic zygote. If you have to minimize the object being destroyed/terminated to make yourself feel better about supporting abortion then perhaps you aren't really all that comfortable with it after all. I'd have more respect for those defending abortion if they had the guts to be realistic and factual about the fetal characteristics at time of abortion and methods necessary to perform the procedure.

Exactly--I found myself wondering the same things, ie, how was it the neighbor KNEW it was the housekeeper's kids, and no one else's, who took the towels? And wouldn't you have noticed 12 missing towels sooner than three months later? If you live in a place where it's warm enough to swim on Easter Sunday, isn't it likely someone would have taken a swim at some time between that date and the Fourth of July?<br/><br/>This makes me uncomfortable, almost as if the neighbor felt obligated to invite the housekeeper's kids because s/he invited all the others but didn't really want to. Now the missing towels are somehow 'evidence' that this housekeeper and her kids (or, more likely, the people they come from) are not fit (and so s/he was right all along to want to exclude them). Hard, otherwise, to explain not only the original note but the response to the letter writer's very generous and reasonable proposed solution. <br/><br/>Icky people. I personally would want to stay out of their pool!

355250
Do you know who made those laws, Terry Brady, that required a literacy test? The Democrats made all those laws after reconstruction.<br/>The Republicans are trying to insure the vote and protect it from the abuses and notorious cheating by Democrats. A voter ID seems to be the simplest, most obvious remedy for fraud. Purging felons from the rolls disenfranchises only felons- who have lost the privilege- although Democrats are agitating to give them and illegals a vote. You may have already forgotten Obama's friends at ACORN who registered more phony voters and seriously compromised the vote. And why are the military votes not counted? Theirs should count twice!

Why shouldn't a business only hire female employees and pay them all less then their male counterparts employed by their competitors?  Wouldn't that give them a competitive edge?<br/><br/>You might argue that this is a ridiculous proposition.  That free market forces will prevail and the female employees will leave to take better paying jobs with those other businesses.  Yes, exactly!

355832
Why are you restricting seigniorage to just physical cash and coins?<br/><br/>Cash and coins are something that foreigners buy with something of value - selling their capital assets or exports of goods and services. But that is also the case with currency reserves!<br/><br/>If China wants to buy $4 trillion it has to find people who are willing to sell that money in exchange for renminbi, and who in US has use for renminbi? US importers and those who wish to invest in assets that are in sale for CNY.<br/><br/>Nobody in the US wants to hold renminbi because that is not the currency you pay taxes with so they have no use for it apart from the aforementioned.<br/><br/>Dynamics of the currency market should not be too hard to understand? Every trade has an counterparty. People don't hold foreign currency, they sell it at currency market or buy goods, services or assets from abroad with it.

Seriously? How is it a "gender pay gap" if men ask for raises and women don't? <br/><br/>Everybody gets what they negotiate!<br/><br/>I am a woman. <br/><br/>I once went into my (male) boss and explained very politely that there were statistics claiming a gender pay gap, and the most likely explanation was that women failed to ask for raises. "That will not be the case here," I said.  I then put in my request. <br/><br/>A few months later the salaries for everyone in the (80% male) company were released accidentally. <br/><br/>I was right where I should have been--making more than some of my male colleagues, and less than a fewer older, more senior folks. <br/><br/>An adage about squeaky wheels and grease comes to mind....

356247
Just like the US has been low ranked for what, 40 years?  Did YOUR parents demand you take tests with ambiguous answers so you were sure to get some wrong?  Did YOUR parents demand that you take an exam that was terribly written with a cut score designed so that the majority of students would fail so YOU could learn that you were stupid, even though you always did well in school?  Or do you think the Greatest Generation just didn't care about their kids' education?   Perhaps you need to read a little history yourself about how the US has always scored in those international assessments before you criticize the parents who opted out.   If you think that taking poorly designed tests with ambiguous non-answers will "teach" children to learn, then every private school in NY State would be CLAMORING to have their kids take these  exams.  They are ALLOWED to give it!  They do not WANT their students to take it.  The wealthy parents in private schools are the ones opting out, so take your complaints to them.

What's to be torn about? Forget videos and forget how one community differs from another. Focus! Many (not all) in Black communities still bear the burdens of slavery and Jim Crow. Many Whites, even (especially) in "liberal" NYC, are blatant, gross racists. First admit the problem, then debate the remedies. Education. Leadership! But craven politicians and unchristian preachers lead in the wrong direction... How to change that? One heart and one mind at a time.

Why don't any countries propose putting sanctions and inspection on nuclear Israel?  The GOP as a whole is against Obama in all ways.  We know how not negotiating with North Korea turned out!  Bombing Iran can only delay the inevitable for so long, unless an all out invasion like Iraq, not an easy task.  US Middle-East policy is about Israel's security.  Why not have Israel join NATO and strike a deal with Iran?

357257
Um, excuse me? I can't believe you said sex slavery by Japanese military is a false accusation. <br/><br/>There are actual Koreans still alive who were forced into sex slavery by Japanese soldiers during the war. Not just Koreans but Chineses too. This is a very controversial issue between not just Korea and Japan, but China and Japan too because Japan wouldn't admit its many war crimes even until now. <br/><br/>It's like Nazis saying they never did anything to the Jews and the Holocaust is something the Jews made up. If somebody said that, how would you feel? That's exactly how I feel after reading your comment!! I don't know where you got this false historic information and you must be brainwashed.

CM are you saying that experience doesn't count? And that we need to make sure that women in general should have their pay equalised to men who have been working and gaining skills for 5 extra years? I'll agree and I'm sure you'll join me in doing everything we can to bring down the huge and shocking gap in pay between the young and middle-aged. That's the real scandal!

Which raises the question, what is accomplished, other than wasting a lot of time, in making this at home?  There are Chinese take-out restaurants on every corner in NYC.  As Jay does, you can ask them to modify it to your specific taste, even.  Why not make from scratch McDonald's-style French fries at home?  Then you can say - you did it!

Is this a version of "All that those people understand is force"?<br/>Something that is said of every enemy!<br/>However if we are not too chauvinistic we may recognize that other cultures have the same foundations and/or traditions of Just War Theory. This certainly includes the Muslim World. In fact, by effectively learning about and invoking these solid traditions of chivalry and Just War, allies can help marginalize this pernicious movement. Only, it must be done to include all players on all sides for this to be more than propaganda or a political tactic.

Remen-mber as well the many - in the hundreds? -- of firemen who died in 9/11 because communictaions did not exist between various autorities.  So these brave souls were never notified NOT to try going up the stairs!  Thsi is one of the major tragedies of 9/11,  I hope that inter-authority communications have since been revisited.<br/><br/>Chinese government order snot to circulate anything but their own version is the bald fact about China's<br/>authoritarian governmennt.

So Kay Bailey Hutchison thinks Obama "has made it impossible for Republicans to vote for it?" Hogwash.  I seem to recall that a number of prominent Republicans were denouncing the agreement before they even read it!  The GOP is not interested in what scientists or military leaders have to say about this deal, it's all about domestic politics.  I'm willing to bet there are quite a few GOP leaders in DC who are quietly trying to make sure that enough Democrats support the agreement so it will take effect, while reserving to themselves the right to rail against it.  More of the same from the Grand Old Plutocrats.

If rape is so "holy" and they "pray before and after", why then is it that the women and girls are so shamed by their religious society and their families sometimes kill them?! "ibadah is worship" or "prayer"??!! Talk about twisted logic!! Surely this should be broadcast all over the region and they should be shamed and condemned.

Why does our government seem to address issues so cautiously? Yes, the gap between top executives and the workers who make money for them and the investors is unconscionable...but so are many other issues in the work place. Let's start with hiring practices. First, although supposedly it is not permitted to ask an applicant's age, we are required to indicate what year we graduated from high school -- duh! Then, of course is the issue of racial, ethnic and gender discrimination.  How about if initial application was reviewed by the hiring entity WITHOUT the name/gender/race included6? And why, exactly, would a credit score be significant in determining if one could sell merchandise, stack shelves, answer phones, input data, etc., etc., etc.  One of the reasons that many of our work force who lost jobs during the recession cannot get hired is because the recession destroyed them financially. And finally, why does 50 years of professional experience suddenly make a senior citizen unemployable?  Why are so many companies punishing those who need parental/caretaker leave that actually would alleviate overall strains on our social welfare systems?<br/><br/>So instead of just the societal issue of the CEO/worker gap, perhaps our government (who, by the way, are actually OUR employees) might look at and do something about all the other issues that are hurting not only American workers, but ultimately our economy as well.

Obama petulant? His oppoents are "not being straight"; his opponents are being alarmist; his opponents are not ignorant but pedal ignorance like it's their stock and trade.  So we take at face value the assertion of a former republican senator from Texas (although KBH is way too moderate for today's GOP) that Obama made it impossible for a republican to vote for the deal!?

"Cuckservative" is an amalgamation of the words "cuckold" and "conservative"? I doubt that because they don't know the meaning of the word cuckold. But they do know the meaning of the word for a male chicken!

AJ NYC Pending Approval<br/>What other President has been yelled out to be a "liar" by a Congressman, while the President addresses a joint session of Congress?<br/><br/>We may and most definitely should negotiate with our "enemies."  But what's the point of talking to "crazies?"  It just does not work (at home or abroad).<br/><br/>There is nothing "petulant" about being honest, direct and showing the American people the fanaticism and outright deceit of the many who do not care a bit about America and American interests (all the while talking of "patriotism"), but care only about undercutting our nation's President and any policy he supports or that the American people would appreciate him for.<br/><br/>May he succeed in gaining Congressional approval for the single most significant development the Middle East has seen since the creation of Israel or discovery of oil.<br/><br/>Want to "change the Middle East?" (as President Bush and neo-cons, emphasis on the "con," claimed as Iraq war rationale).  Then sign the darn deal!  Nothing else available in the real world could have as great an impact.

And we think we Americans can defeat ISIS because our American values are better than ISIS' values?<br/><br/>Ha, ha, ha.<br/><br/>And Donald "I'm worth a billion dollars and had three deferments" Trump is just the man for the job! (at least Trump is honest enough to say what all GOP candidates believes but are too cowardly to say).<br/><br/>"Every year, thousands of innocent people are sent to jail only because they can’t afford to post bail, putting them at risk of losing their jobs, custody of their children — even their lives."

What would I like the American feminist movement to do?  In short, make the fight against ISIS a feminist issue!  How about holding a demonstration or two in the streets?  How about allying with feminists from Muslim backgrounds like Ayaan Hirsi Ali to denounce Islamic misogyny?  Write some op-eds denouncing ISIS and other Islamic extremists.  How about getting as passionate about ISIS mass rape and child slavery as relatively less urgent matters like pay equity and employer funded contraceptive coverage?  

359304
I'm sorry - didn't you get the memo?  You are excluded from pay equity because you 'took time out' from the work force to see to your own needs.  Therefore, you must be grateful to be allowed to rejoin the workforce at any level whatsoever.  If you had had more foresight you would have married and had children, thus ensuring your longterm survival and care.<br/><br/>In other words, your entire function in life is to act as a convenient focus of pure phantasy as to how human beings who are female are 'supposed' to live life.  If you violate the rules of that phantasy well - you deserve it.<br/><br/>Welcome to the world, Sister!

Do you honestly believe this? Your first point, or the opposite of it, has long since been proved. That carbon dioxide traps heat was proved in the 19th century.<br/><br/><a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" title="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" target="_blank">http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</a><br/><br/>Since the mid-1800s, scientists have known that CO2 is one of the main greenhouse gases of importance to Earth’s energy balance. Direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere and in air trapped in ice show that atmospheric CO2 increased by about 40% from 1800 to 2012. Measurements of different forms of carbon (isotopes, see Question 3) reveal that this increase is due to human activities. Other greenhouse gases (notably methane and nitrous oxide) are also increasing as a consequence of human activities. The observed global surface temperature rise since 1900 is consistent with detailed calculations of the impacts of the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 (and other human-induced changes) on Earth’s energy balance.<br/><a href="https://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/climate-evidence-causes/question-2/" title="https://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/climate-evidence-causes/question-2/" target="_blank">https://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/climate-evidence-causes/questio...</a><br/><br/>Yet another case of dangerous talk, of someone trying to mislead Americans, ignorant and gullible people. It's amazing how persistent these myths are and the will to stay ignorant.<br/><br/>Do more, New York Times!

359460
Really NYT?  This is the best "The Upshot" can come up with, especially on the heels of the Tuesday's  "New York State Test Questions" for 3rh graders about keeping secrets?  This little blurb is on a par with "My phone is smarter than your honor student" bumper sticker.  If you want to really test the smarts of New York Times readers, give us something with substance and real intelligence.  Other than that, have a really nice day!

How could any community have justice and peace when they cannot trust its law enforcement? That's what minority communities face. Have a violent family member? Should you call the cops and make it worse, or deal with it? No wonder there's outrage! We should all be outraged! All communities need to be able to trust law enforcement, but I guess that's a just luxury for the well-to-do.

Are you actually saying, in point # 3, that we  need an agreement with Iran to retain the option of a military strike?! I only go back to WWII, but I don't recall any agreements with Japan or Germany...

Would the guys be doing that if the VP were a woman?  Possibly.  But maybe if the VP were a woman you'd be interested in staying later to chat with her.  More likely you'd just want to get out of Dodge as soon as possible anyway (unless the VP was mentoring you in some way that was meaningful and encouraging to your career - one can only hope!).  The "socializing at work" stuff is a real conundrum for women.  In my experience both genders do it a little when you're younger and first starting out, but then women don't bother because they develop a life outside of work when they have a family, or maybe they realize the social network at work is rigged against them anyway and not that much fun, especially if they don't have much in common with the majority of their co-workers/bosses to begin with.  Socializing at work is awkward when you're an outsider, and becomes more and more awkward as your home life tugs at you.  For a lot of women, it is the first thing they give up on at work, and then the downward spiral begins.

State terrorism? This is based on assumption that the encounters under discussion, between police and citizens, were acts of the State, which they were not.<br/>A State mission or ideology was not being pursued by the officers. Therefore terrorism is not a part of the story. This is hyper-inflated terminology spinning in circles. No logic!

Getting fired for discussing salaries?  How did I miss THAT over the last 45 years?  I’ve worked in small medical practices up to Kaiser HMOs.  NEVER heard that before!<br/><br/>Also the federal civilian workforce has a pay scale that equals your pay grade.  For example I worked as a civilian MD at Pearl Harbor.  GS-15 rating starts at $102,000 with ten steps. PLUS if you worked in an area that was expensive to live--say Hawai’i you got 22% COLA--Cost of Living Adjustment on top of your basic pay.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2015/general-schedule/" title="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2015/general-schedule/" target="_blank">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2015/...</a><br/><br/>It LITERALLY took an Act of Congress to increase the pay scales.  Sequestration put a huge damper on that.  That’s why the VA is having trouble hiring doctors and nurses.<br/><br/>Private sector?  Government work?  I never heard ANYONE threatened with termination!  <br/><br/>Could you supply us with that from your employer’s manual on conduct??

360231
Have ANY of you actually applied for a job in the last ten years?  It’s all done on computers.  No HR offices.  You log on, find a job opening and fill in THEIR  resume.  No question on gender or age.  You either have the skills they want for that job or not.<br/><br/>I just had a 58 y/o friend (RN) who hadn’t done nursing in 10 years.  No human being tossed her aside for being old or female. The job skills did NOT require bedside nursing--(NO nurse can do bedside nursing after age 45--too hard to do 12 hour shifts)--but this job required analysis of a patient’s admission, hospitalization, discharge with medications and whether they ended up back in the hospital within 30 days...a problem that can count against a doctor being able to accept Medicare.<br/><br/>Theoretically if you say you have done 32 years as an Intensive care Unit nurse it gives them some idea of how old you are...and your first name may be a giveaway..can’t use initials--have to have full name that appears on a professional license.<br/><br/>But it’s more fair than walking into an HR office and having a 25 y/o secretary say “Wow you are REALLY old!”  Yeah that happened to me!<br/><br/>My friend got a second job that DID require an “older female nurse.”  It was rape counseling and obtaining specimens for a rape kit.  The general finding in this evangelical city was that women trusted and felt more comfortable with an older female nurse more than a 25 y/o male nurse. Some areas just can’t be equal...we let the patient choose.

Who is kidding who? So long as there is a sectarian and religious nod to this agreement, it will always be contentious and challenged by the Sunni and Kurd factions. Democracy in Iraq will not work period. The pottery barn has been shattered and all the kings horses and all the kings men will not be able to put "Saddam" back together again! Feel really bad for the poor people of Iraq.

What "truth" texts are you referring to?  The Quran and the Bible?  Both are essentially folk lores that have been reedited repeatedly and frequently used as political manifestos by various rulers throughout the centuries to further their own selfish agendas.  Christianity is merely further advanced than Islam inasmuch as it no longer condones burning people at the stake or crucifying them.<br/>So much for Shariah "law"!  

360455
You can't be that dense can you? This is approved of in the Quran and Saddam's men were raping and pillaging in Kuwait before we arrived to stop them. Oh, did you forget about Saddam's raping / torturing sons, and the crimes he committed against his people? you need to re-google some Saddam stories. Also look to the past of the Barbary wars and the slavery and pirating people just like this perpetrated. I think the media has you too far lead down the path of blame America first!

360468
Public shaming?  Now that will stop it!  What the commenters here need to do instead of wringing their collective hands is to get up and away from their screens and start physically doing something about this threat to our Western way of life.  Where are the mass demos?  Enough is enough!  Where is the leadership against not only ISIS but conservative - radical Islam?<br/>We can complain, make fun of and do all sorts of actions when radical Christians (Hasidim should also be a target) do something offensive -- but they are not killing people or enslaving them --- but we remain silent in the face of Islam out of fear of being labeled Islamaphobic.

"Arguably legal"? No due process. No charges. Indefinite detainment. No right to counsel. People, who for all we know may be completely innocent, trying to starve themselves to death after ten years of illegal incarceration being force fed?<br/><br/>Where is your moral compass?<br/><br/>The "equation" is apt!

360798
Authoritarian, yes, but "Why are you taking pictures of me, doing this to me?" also have shades of Kafka. <br/><br/>Disturbing!

Nine-month old episodes? Why, they will be all worn out and used up by then.  Those rich kids with HBO access will suck all the educational value out of those shows, so they will be nothing but decrepit junk by the time the poor kids get them.  That's the America we live in today;  poor kids have to watch nine-month old educational TV.   Terrible!

Mr Tomlin has forty one (41) convictions (as in found guilty) including 2 felonies?!  Is the underlying issue here bail that is too high or an endless life of crime?  <br/><br/>I wish the NYTimes would quit playing mother Teresa to dead-end faux social causes and dedicate what remains of their staff to science, technology and the environment.

361045
Have I so badly misunderstood my public after 31 years of NYPD service?<br/>All along I thought the daily (and in some precincts, EVERY DAY) gun fire was a source of terror!<br/>I really believed that risking a child's life for wearing fashionable sneakers or jackets, or even a perceived 'dis' was yet another source.<br/>Going out at night, standing on the wrong corner with the wrong people was yet another.<br/>Giving kids mugging money struck me as somewhat intimidating.<br/>Seniors, some with prison camp I.D.'tatoo's on their arms, afraid to answer a door for fear of push in robbery, threats to turn over social security checks monthly or face beatings or worse; I thought that was terrorizing.<br/>Elderly people afraid to shop or walk the streets alone, without fear.<br/>Gangs of kids preying on ( mugging) the elderly; a racial component here; mostly a black on white crime.<br/>Drug dealers running entire neighborhoods (with patrol cops forbidden to initiate arrests for fear of, among other factors, initiating riots and other discord) a forerunner of drive by's and turf wars seemed to fit 'terrorizing'.<br/>Too many tickets? In NYC the mostly middle class area's were the major source of 'summons income' for the city, but I never dreamed we were unconstitutionally terrorizing our public. Times have sure changed!

361089
And why don't we do anything about it, anything effective? Because we're so tangled up with the corrupt governments in the Middle East and Central Asia that promote this horror we can't tell if we're coming or going. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, and even now Turkey ... we can't figure out who our enemies or who our friends are ... if you're standing in Turkey, you're on friendly territory and have a common enemy in ISIS, and if you walk into Iraq, your friend in Turkey has become an adversary who is fighting against people you're supporting who are the only real military force capable of combating ISIS. Turkey is using the attack on ISIS from their territory as cover to attack the Kurds in Iraq. And if you fight ISIS, you are fighting people who were created by the rabidly fundamentalist, oppressive world of Saudi Arabia, whom we support. We have no idea what we are doing in that part of the world. The ignorant, naive George Bush set off a holocaust of unimaginable proportions when he invaded Iraq (and now his little brother Jeb! rails against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for "standing by" when Iraq descended into chaos). Where was he when his brother stole the election, and then took the the country into war under false pretenses? We've unleashed a nightmare. And the elephant in the room that on one wants to admit is that the only way we'll be able to put the genie back into the bottle is to create an alliance with Iran. How else will this be stopped?

9 months delay no big deal? That's an entire school year! Perhaps you forget what its like to be in school when certain kids got things because of their economic advantages - and you did not. <br/><br/>How did that make you feel?

Why, if so many nuclear experts and former military leaders think it's a good deal would the Republicans oppose it?   Because it came from the Obama administration.    No other reason necessary.    Unbelievable!

Why on Earth would they do that?  That is an asinine thought!  Sesame Street is just a TV show for kids.  Yes, it is somewhat "educational" (but even that can be debated).  However, to compare the importance of a military base with a silly TV show -- which brings in MILLIONS each week in merchandising revenue -- is absolutely ridiculous.

There seems to me to be a chasm separating young people just looking for a higher meaning in their lives who are attracted to the Islamic State, and the individuals who behead other humans, or see rape as salvation (or whatever?!)  While those of us in America are reassured by Muslims who assure us that they are god-fearing and non-violent, they ignore the savagery of their fellow Muslims in the Middle East who behave with savage and depraved violence towards "infidels".<br/><br/>How does belief in Allah morph into brutality and barbarous behavior?<br/><br/>As Joseph Campbell said so tellingly in The True Believer, "A rising mass movement attracts and holds a following not by its doctrine and promises but by the refuge it offers from the anxieties, barrenness and meaninglessness of an individual existence."

GOP &amp; THE 1%  How could any GOP hopefuls possible make any significant statements about fairness in dealing with student debt?  After all, they support the good of the 1% over the 99%.  Who needs more of the same?  I'm fortunate because when I was in college, student loans were so favorable that I always borrowed the maximum amount and paid back as slowly as possible.  Now the reverse is true.  Our kids, whose educations we gladly funded, tell us how lucky they are (though not during their college years), because of the hardship their friends are undergoing to struggle to pay back student loans.  Mainly because of predatory financial institutions, laws that favor gouging by lenders and the lack of well-paid jobs.  It's the perfect storm that's destroying opportunity and hope for the younger generation.  Both of our kids are highly talented and intelligent, but underemployed, working long hard hours for little pay.  Had they incurred student debt, it would be a crushing burden to them now.  Me, I'm in favor of free higher education via online courses.  They're here, they're free and pretty soon will be accredited.  So colleges and universities beware:  Change is on the way, sooner rather than later!

You're complaining about the 0s and 1s bringing the average down?!  What about people that guessed 99 or 100 (which is literally impossible), or the big chunk of people who guessed 66 (which would only be right if everyone else guessed 100)??  Those guesses drove the average way up!!  I mean, congratulations on coming way closer than I did, but sheesh, I was really surprised by the size of the bar at 66.

362361
Know something else that fills this profile? MAN hunting! You can respect a man (or woman!) AND his/her culture while tracking, killing, and beheading - and consider how beneficial it would really be for the species (all things considered, I mean). Why, it should be possible to set up a safari camp at Wall and Broad Streets and mingle with the prey before selecting a fat one you respect above all the others, I suspect. Win-win!

How many children are turned off to reading because of these types of tests, and the preparation that goes into them?  Differentiating between best and second-best answers??  Talk about kill-joy!<br/><br/>12 years ago my public school started testing kindergarteners! on reading.  All of a sudden, fun stories, just for the fun of it, went out the window.  Before reading to a group, I was expected to teach 'author' 'illustrator' 'what do you think this story is going to be about?'.  During the story, I was to stop after each page and ask questions about what I had just read.  After the story, (don't ask how many children were still interested at this point!), another round of comprehension questions.   Gone was the magic of imagination, the rapt attention of children transported to another world.<br/><br/>A good teacher knows how to subtly assess comprehension and sharpen critical thinking skills.  Hitting young children over the head with pedantic, pedestrian questions makes them bored, makes them groan when reading time comes around, and makes them avoid reading on their own because they dread the grilling that will come after.<br/><br/>Imagination, people, and joy of discovery, is what creates good students and brilliant minds.  We do such a perfect of sucking the life out of learning.  <br/><br/>I left teaching Ks and 1st graders because of the emphasis on 'academic' achievement.  I chose those ages because of the joy it gave me to instill a love of learning.  Mr. Bruni, that is the answer to your column.

Why aren't these mothers happy with just the bridal shower? That one is the perfect event for what they describe they want - a nice womanly pre-wedding bonding activity they can share with their daughter. I just attended a bridal shower organized by the mother, attended by the mother, aunt, grandma and other older female relatives, plus the girl's female friends, and it was lovely. Drinks and pastries and presents and chit-chat. Strippers and debauchery is a whole separate thing that should be kept separate, in my opinion... Everybody deserves some privacy. Those mothers should let their daughters have it!

"Can a Hotel Robot Read a ‘Do Not Disturb’ Sign?"<br/>We've all watched those old cheesy movies and shows where somebody time travels to the future to discover a world dominated and run by robots. Suffice to say, many saw electronically run beings one day taking over ordinary tasks that we humans are too lazy to do. Some have even worried that these "beings" would one day enslave the entire human race! Although this may seem a bit far fetched, the world as we know it may just have begun it's transition into a new era of technology. Robots are now being brought into actual hotels! "Relay, a three-foot-tall rolling robot, can make room service deliveries and drop off small items like toothbrushes and phone chargers. The robot requests elevators via Wi-Fi, calls the room ahead of its deliveries and (when it senses the room door has opened) pops open a two-cubic-foot cargo container before departing with R2D2-like electronic happy noises." Granted it would be insanely cool to have an actual robot deliver room service, but how well can a robot understand the concept of privacy? Imagine changing in your hotel room bedroom only to have a robot enter without knocking to deliver your toothpaste! Obviously robots aren't at least for now sophisticated enough to understand what most conclude to be simple things like human emotion, but they are growing to become more and more advanced. Robots may just be on their way to replace our humanly roles. Whether this si good or bad is all opinion.

@Baron95<br/>"Is pay too low at Walmart? No. Why not? Because that pay is sufficient to attract and retain the skills needed to staff a Walmart store.”<br/><br/>I had tears of anger come to my eyes reading this statement!  <br/><br/>Here are some facts which add a little to Pottrees’ comment.<br/><br/>"The Waltons aren’t just the face of the 1%; they’re the face of the 0.000001%. THE WALTONS HAVE MORE WEALTH THAN 42% OF AMERICAN FAMILIES COMBINED.<br/><br/>Why does all of this matter? While the Waltons are building billion-dollar museums, driving million-dollar cars, and jumping between vacation homes, Walmart, the country’s largest private employer, is paying its associates an average of $8.81 an hour. The Waltons make billions a year off of a company most of them don’t even work for, while Walmart associates struggle for respect on the job and enough pay to make ends meet.”<br/><br/>Sir we are talking about basic human decency!  I needed to go into a Walmart today as I was “forced to.”  An employee was sitting on the floor changing prices on a shelf.  I asked her where a certain item was.  She said “Just a minute I will show you.”  It took her a full minute to get to a standing position---I could tell that she had back, hip, and knee pain. (I’m an MD) I pleaded with her--“Don’t get up!  It’s not necessary!  Just point the way!”  I felt awful!  She said that the manager wanted the employees to walk a customer to the right product from now on.<br/><br/>Could YOU do that Baron?  Of course not as you are a “self-made” man!

What immoralities of ours led to World War II? What immoralities of ours led to ISIS? War isn't an event, a decision. It's an ongoing way thinking, an ongoing way of seeing the world. If we were to become the "they" who are the human shields, would our dry moral calculus of balancing evils be altered by that perspective? Get these philosophers out of here! Pry their cold, dead hearts off of our guns!

Say ISIS? If the locals can't get their acts together to defeat ISIS, both in military and in philosophical terms, how is it the primary responsibility of Americans to die on their behalf? Obama has been working on a real strategy (which many on the Right like to confuse with tactics!). Turkey has joined the fight, exposing its own selfish interests. When will the ruling Saud family stop spreading Wahhabism and confront the monster they've helped to create?

Rima,<br/><br/>"The cheap manufactured goods our Oligarchs are buying there"? You need to get out more! The Chinese have been selling and distributing directly in the U.S. For years.<br/><br/>The whole of Southern California is a sea of warehouses full of imported Chineese goods and managed by imported Chinese managers. The "native" American workers are moving boxes around in the warehouse out back!<br/><br/>These Chinese firms sell direct on the Internet and compete with Walmart not support it! The Chinese have "invaded" the U.S. a few miles from where you live. That You (and the Socialists here) can't see this because you are more interested in taking control of the government is "unfortunate".<br/><br/>Things in China have not changed that greatly over the years. China is and has been the "terrible example" of Central Government run amok. The same sort of "Central Government" you wish to burden us here in the U.S. With.<br/><br/>This "Op-Ed" is about the "Clueless Chinese Government" what you don't see is a word about the "Criminally Clueless EPA Officials" that loosed a literal tidal wave of poisonous mine sludge on several State populations here in the U.S.<br/><br/>The "Problem" in China and at the NYT as well, is the belief that Central Government is the solution to whatever your problem is. <br/><br/>The Stock Market, the Deadly Explosion and the Toxic Flood are all a result of too much Central Government. Here unlike in China the Press can expose Government Criminality and incompitance. The Crime here is that they don't!

Well that is the problem here; which children, which families? One might assume everyone from the egg hunt went on to swim at the neighbors, but the neighbor zeroed in on the children of the help and no one else. She made the assumption that these children had a different set of ethics than those who lived in the neighborhood. In my book, that's bigotry at its finest. The employer, wanting to defuse the situation without insulting her housekeeper, attempted a solution that did not work. It's interesting how people reveal themselves to us...we think they are good neighbors, but we find out their characters are wanting...time to get to know the people across the street!

How are we doing on race relations anywhere on this planet?  Race relations are bad in the US, but believe me I have lived in many places outside of the US and it's bad there too.  And by the way, genuine remorse means nothing without some genuine actions to go with it!

Is anyone running on the Republican side claim such tremendous growth in the face of so much adversity? They should read this article and also the 'talking heads' at the twenty four hour news 'wackosphere' whose mantra is to follow the crowd  and not analyzing the facts and figures before preaching non-stop on politics. Can anyone cover this great feat. Jerry Brown for president!

Question for you: why cook it? I've been making vanilla ice cream at home with just cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla for a while now, and it's one of my favorite discoveries--and even easier than this recipe, because I don't have to heat it and then re-chill it. Give me some incentive to take this extra step! (I sometimes also make Jeni's ice cream, which requires cooking and is a lot more complicated, for a different outcome--richness &amp; some really distinctive tastes. I do this no-heat vanilla when I need a welcome break of simplicity).

Hold on, you are going to quote Trump's books as facts?!  Now that is rich.  2 cents - here's your change...

"Contrition and responsibility?" The guy spent 22 years in jail!<br/><br/>Your insensitivity is astounding. Yes, he sold drugs, but maybe if America hadn't abandoned its African-Americans and inner cities and provided some of that "opportunity" the Republicans love to talk about so much, he might have found a better career path.

364749
@shirleyjw<br/><br/>"Did you watch the market over the past week?"<br/><br/>Er....the market has entirely erased the losses following the Yuan devaluation announcement! Growth is anemic? Relative to what? Economics is largely a matter of relativities, not absolutes, which is a basic concept you don't seem grasp. In fact the US economy is currently in great shape by just about every measure.

364779
Bernie Sanders an outlier?!  I and thousands like me beg to differ with you, NY Times headline writers! I expect better from the NYT.  I think you do know he is the only candidate who is addressing the terribly serious issues our democracy faces, and that he is a very viable presidential candidate.<br/>He's the only one who is not beholden to corporate and individual donors.<br/><br/>I say, "Give that man power and the pulpit that goes with it!" 

364818
You really think so?<br/><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357" title="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357" target="_blank">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357</a><br/><br/>Also, when people were screaming, Audit the Fed!, guess who had it audited.

How is it the Republicans' fault? what were his parents doing when he was out selling drugs? Why didn't other society elders stop him? Why do poor immigrants in these communities manage to find the way out and not sell drugs?! These defenses are old and ridiculous...

364917
What does the NYT have against Bernie Sanders? Sanders has been surging in the polls, and his popularity is growing as he becomes known to the public.  However, any bit of positive news about his candidacy for the presidency is  often met by the Times  with skepticism and thinly veiled pronouncements that he does not have a prayer at winning the nomination. What Sanders has done the past few months in terms of getting his message out with no big donors to bankroll him is amazing.  He is definately hitting a nerve as people are seeing him as an honest politician who is not for sale.  Go Bernie and make the Times look like a bunch of fools for marginalizing you!

REBRIAN:Why is it necessary to have an establishment candidate, as u describe HRC? Why is it imperative to bash the "political/left ceiling" as u put it?What is her constituency?What leads u to believe that America wants her, and what r her achievements, either as  a US Senator or as Secretary of State? You will recall when a focus group of HRC supporters was asked that question, what were her signal achievements, an uncomfortable silence ensued.No one could name a single piece of legislation that HRC sponsored as a Senator, or any breakthrough she could take credit for in then ME peace process.I hope this election upcoming will be a watershed moment, marking the passing of the old guard, which includes the Bushes and the Clintons. Both families have become troglodytes, out of place in today's world. If Biden can prove to be a counter force to HRC, I say "Right on!"

Should we all be counting the sugar in fruit?  For example, prunes are loaded with sugar.  Stop eating them?  And what about a glass of OJ in the morning?  It has 22 grams of sugar!  Oh boy.  Getting potassium just became a little more difficult :-(

We discarded Bernie's theories of government over 100 years ago? What drivel!.

"most of his customers were buying his drugs instead of feeding their kids"<br/><br/>And you know this how?<br/><br/>And even if it's true, their choice.  Many people are sitting in bars drinking scotch and beer and not feeding their children.  Put the bartenders in jail!

365272
Isn't it a good idea to set aside something in good times against the bad times ?<br/>Just remember here in the UK we pay roughly $6.40 for a gallon thanks to government taxes, and that's a so-called conservative (Republican) government who are busy cutting investment in alternative energies and embracing fracking - bring on the socialist revolution (fat chance)! I'm sorry for my American friends (yes, really) and my cousins in the USA, but you really do need to look hard at your future, forget the weasel words of your politicians and realise things are not what they used to be, nor are they likely to go back to being other than in the short term - embrace alternative energy now, or we all suffer.

365557
Why are we stirring up trouble here?<br/>If it has too much sugar for some, don't drink it.  That's the beauty of freedom.<br/>Like anything, if you drink it 24/7, it will probably kill you. Are we actually looking for more government creep? At least they took the cocaine out of it a hundred years ago! Now, it will rot your teeth and gut. So, have one on birthdays. Enough already. Leave a kid's tooth, a screw, and a piece of lunch meat in a glass of it overnight. You'll never drink it again.

365582
Sorry?!  Why not demonize Coke for spreading misinformation?  Coke deserves to be demonized for this conduct, as do other junk food purveyors, tobacco companies and many others.

365586
What kind of Americans are you?! Now get out there and over-consume! Coca-Cola depends upon it, the for-profit medical establishment depends upon it, and your country depends upon it! Don't tell us you aren't willing to develop diabetes  for the sake of your country, big pharma, and the sugar industry!<br/><br/>Seriously, the only ethical and healthy thing to do from now on is boycott Coke.

What interted me in the New York Times this week? I would have to say seseme street season 5 making its debut on HBO. Seseme street was always a bug part of my child hood and for many years it was almost non existent, so to hear that they are making a new season and with a very large television corporation is wonderful. Even for my sister who is 7 years older then me im sure this exiting news. She used to watch sesme street nonstop from stories iv heard from my parents. Her first word was even "Big Bird". You can see how this played a large roll in our childhood and to see it is still going strong many many years later is so great. I wish the people who created sesme street and all there affiliates best of luck in there new season and I know they will get a view from me! This is what interested me<br/>In the New York Times this week

365794
Seriously? "The government IS the problem!" And ever since that unfortunate speech the leaders in our country have been loath to raise the needed funds to support our roads, our railroads, our airports and our universities.<br/><br/>"Get the government off my back and out of my pocket!"<br/><br/>Reap what you sow, America.

365832
Senator Bernie Sanders an "outlyer"?  Well, I guess so if you consider that he is surrounded in the Senate by men and women who (although elected by "the people") have been bought and sold several times over by big banks, Wall Street, big agriculture (e.g., MONSANTO), subsidies to big oil, tobacco, the Kochs and their ilk.  No one owns him, and we know it.  So when we listen to Bernie Sanders as he travels around the country we see a candidate who understands the BIG issues in our country that are under threat (Medicare, Social Security) income inequality that rivals that of 3rd world countries, wars that just won't go away and thirst for more,<br/>etc., etc., etc.  We know he isn't lying to us; the truths are difficult to cope with, but he has some solutions and is asking our help in being in a position to resolve some of the most important issues of our time.  He's not afraid of work; he won't be distracted by "the flavor of the moment," and he's our guy!  #BernieSanders2016!

366023
If this piece was expected (intended?) to alter perceptions of Senator Sanders in the negative, at least as far as I am concerned it failed.  To the contrary, I am more solidly behind this man of principle and backbone than ever.  The politicians in DC who sneer at him, disrespect him, and consider him a sideshow populist are as so many Neros, fiddling while the nation is in flames, and inflamed.  This may just be the change so many have been waiting for.  If so, it's coming not a minute too soon.  Keep tellin' it like it is Bernie!  Millions of us are listening.

366040
Outlier?  Bernie knows what the working class needs.  He knows what they/we want.  He listens.  He isn't beholden to banks, insurance companies, oil companies, etc.  He is so far from Hilary that it's laughable.  He's getting huge crowds, to boot.  Yet papers like the NYT will ignore him, demean him, discredit him as a candidate, so they can have a president who will be beholden to Big Media.  People, let's give them the shock of their lives and work for, vote for, elect Bernie Sanders!!

366057
And what would be so bad about losing the Bucks from Milwaukee?  Oh right, Scott Walker would lose campaign financing!  I nearly forgot... which is exactly what they expect us all to do -- forget and pay up.

: What do we do with 11 million people already here? Mr. Trump wants to kick them all out — a Trail of Tears for the 21st century. <br/><br/>“Kick them out” and “a Trail of Tears” are hardly phrases that convey an objective view of what many citizens with no trace of hate in their bones want to do, namely, encourage the burgeoning illegal subpopulation to think seriously about self-deportation.  Consistent failure across successive national administrations to enforce immigration law has given illegal immigrants the understandable albeit erroneous view that “Bienvendio! Nuestro pais es tu pais” is the official immigration policy of the U.S.  <br/><br/>More than two centuries ago Pope said, re tolerance of vice: "Vice is a monster of so frightful miien/ as to be feared needs only to be seen/but seen too oft, familiar with her face/we first endure, then pity, then embrace.<br/><br/>So it is that  we've come, not to hate but to embrace ithe emobidments of illegal immigration by defaut.<br/><br/>Deprive them of the carrot of illegal employment by extending and mandating use of E-Verify, nationwide, by employers all (large and small), mandate participation of local police in enforcement of immigration law, create legal avenues for recruiting legal replacements for self-deporting illegal residents, if citizen-replacements can’t be found, etc.  <br/><br/>Thoughtful legislation  embodying such proposals should result in gradual reduction in national aggravation associated with the bane of illegal immigration.

How many years do you think he should serve in order to pay his debt to society? At what cost to the taxpayer is enough? Of course he should have been punished, but your thinking is way off base. People like you sicken me!!!

What do you mean you can't get to 0??  The only reasonable answer to this is to go as low as you can.  Since the range that was given was 0-100 (inclusive), then not only 'can' you get to 0, but everybody 'should' get there!<br/><br/>Let's say 3 people were playing this.  Two of them followed your logic and guessed 1.  Then I guessed 0.  Which one of the three of us would be correct?  Me!!!  I was hoping at least 1/3 of Times readers would understand that, so the correct answer would be 0.  Wow was I wrong!

366377
Low information? On the contrary. His supporters are the ones who are actually paying attention!

 I've often wondered where the patriots are? Finally one has emerged standing heads and shoulders above all the other candidates.   Lord knows we need him now!  Give him the coverage he deserves. America will be better for it.

Third's the charm? Unfortunately not this time.  This third memorandum of understanding solves nothing.  It still calls (however unbelievable it sounds) for an unreasonable amount of austerity (3.5% of GDP primary surpluses), privatizations (in spite that Greece hasn't been able to do them time and again) and unreasonable reforms.  Mind-blowingly it still not contains any debt relief! This was a triumph of German stubbornness and world indifference.  Greece will continue with depression-level stagnation, social unrest, and we will soon be back to the discussions we had last June and July. A sad day for our Greek friends.

Make bread, it's ridiculously easy and it's better than that "artisanal" (who invented that stupid concept?!?) junk.  Wheat, water, salt, oil for flavor, honey, yeast, you're done.  And the ingredients are cheaper than the cheapest supermarket bread.

Yes, and if the United States is a democracy, how does my state of New York get the same number of senators as Vermont?  Don't we the people in New York outnumber our neighbors to the north east? <br/><br/>Has Senator Sanders ever campaigned against that injustice?  Will he ever?  Lord, no!  If he fought that fight, and won, he'd be out of a job.<br/><br/>I'm kidding, of course.  I like the man, I like what he says, I'm glad a socialist has finally got some airtime, and I may vote for him in the Democratic primary here in New York, should he get on the ballot.

367059
Why does the Times refer to Senator Sanders as a populist?<br/>Here in Australia such a description has undertones of "not serious".<br/>Maybe in America it means something different but it still sounds belittling and/or a putdown.<br/>Senator Sanders seems to be the only politician, so far, who has a policy framework that makes any sense in this oligarchs-gone-mad world that we are living in.<br/>We have the same sort of mindset among our Government over hear and we also need a "Bernie"!

Do deficit worriers deserve respct? No. Especially when they are economists.<br/><br/>"Don't you wonder that there's going to be a financing crunch?" Paul Krugman 2004<br/><br/>"The accident -- the fiscal train wreck -- is already under way." Paul Krugman 2003<br/><br/>"What I envision is that at some point, we have about 10 years now until the baby boomers hit the United States." "I think, where in that 10 years the crunch comes, I don't know. I think there's a real possibility that next year or one or two years from now, when they see that actually the same irresponsible tax cuts as the solution to everything continue, we might have a crisis that soon but more likely towards the end of the decade." Paul Krugman 2004<br/><br/>Social Security going broke 10 years from 2004, that's ... last year! <br/><br/>Britain hasn't gone bankrupt since 1692 but the US was going to within 10 years. Ouch. <br/><br/>"What will that plunge look like? It will certainly involve a sharp fall in the dollar and a sharp rise in interest rates. In the worst-case scenario, the government's access to borrowing will be cut off, creating a cash crisis that throws the nation into chaos."<br/>Krugman 2003<br/><br/>"But we're looking at a fiscal crisis that will drive interest rates sky-high."<br/>Krugman 2003<br/><br/><a href="http://bit.ly/bnbLd" title="bit.ly/bnbLd" target="_blank">bit.ly/bnbLd</a><br/>nyti.ms/tsrS4N<br/><a href="http://bit.ly/tIZGaW" title="bit.ly/tIZGaW" target="_blank">bit.ly/tIZGaW</a><br/><br/>And all of this because of not understanding fiat money.<br/><a href="http://www.gurufocus.com/news_print.php?id=147269" title="http://www.gurufocus.com/news_print.php?id=147269" target="_blank">http://www.gurufocus.com/news_print.php?id=147269</a>

I'm sorry, but testing once a year is "too much"?!?  Are you kidding me?  Shouldn't we be testing once a week in the grade schools?  And sure, we're talking a bigger test, but these tests are the best way to know if your kid is getting what he or she needs!  This is as insane--and as abusive--as parents who scream that no one is going to tell them what to feed their kids and then stuff them full of chicken nuggets and hot dogs and potato chips.  Have we no sense anymore?

How crazy can it get? How about having your bathroom habits turn up on your annual review? That happened to a young relative who works in Amazon's headquarters. Having kidney problems, she was advised by her doctor to drink more water. She did. Her boss, who monitors her underlings computer time for efficiency and productivity, noticed that several times a day my relative was unproductive. Why, she asked. In the bathroom, my relative said, after drinking water as per doctor's orders.<br/>Unacceptable! That earned my relative a ding on her performance review -- a not small consideration as stock options are tied to performance.<br/>My relative is now drinking less water.  

368202
Seriously?  A company that does nothing of no real importance unless you consider getting a Frozen doll to some spoiled American in 30 minutes significant.  Shame on amazon for treating their employees this way...you are not saving lives or helping humankind in any way shape or form.  What greed!  I won't shop with your  company again.  Life is short and working under these condition and sacrificing family?   Any one who works there and likes it  must have no life and priorities that you will one day regret.  Take this job and shove it! 

368436
Donald Trump, diplomat?!  It's alarming enough to imagine The Donald reporting for jury duty this week!  He is so self-satisfied and self-important, I can't envision him entertain negotiations and dialogue.  With starry eyes looking at his reflection, inferiority is the standard he uses to assess others.  Different perspectives mean nothing to him.  Trump might as well have the Tin Man on his campaign if he is to run on his heart.  His love in life (money aside) is himself.  This man should not be named jury foreman, let alone our international representative.

368467
So, your paper's reporting was wrong again, yesterday?  It said the Fbi said Hillary is not a Target.  The Fbi is investigating the flow of State emails.  Who sent it to her.  It looks like an interagency argument between State &amp; Intel about the way they handle classified.  <br/><br/>Uh, the article said Rice used the same flow system when she was SOS, as well as personal email.  So whatever!

368612
Are you saying that young men learn nothing about women from their mothers or sisters or aunts? And, are only young men committing this violence against women? Do all men who are restricted from sex until marriage commit such atrocities? I don't give these men any excuses. This is certainly not an exception to otherwise perfect gentlemen in war!!!   They are using and demeaning women as has been done forever, as far as we know.

Sorry-- having a child to cure depression? Aaaakkk!<br/><br/>On the other hand if you mean NOW that the kitten has worked its magic, well, yes, indeed. If a child has been part of your "someday"dreams.

Is this not the logical extension of a culture (which pretty well encompasses the entire world at this point) that places value primarily on endless production and "growth"?  Just what is it that we are attempting to achieve at this point by producing more and more "stuff". Really.  The biospheric systems are in increasing peril due to our insistence on the production and transportation and endless growth of "stuff".  It is a story that can not possibly have a happy ending and yet we insist on counting to tell it.  If collective humanity were a not-very-mature adolescent (and we ARE!!), a wise Elder would say something like, "It's time to grow up.  Yes, we all need stuff, but there are limits. If you all don't figure out how to share and to be happy with a relatively lesser share of stuff then...you ain't ever going to make it to adulthood."

368810
It's getting harder and harder to avoid sugar -- I've noticed that even when I heat milk for my morning coffee, if it boils over, what does it smell like?  Burnt sugar!  Yuck!<br/><br/>I've cut back on processed foods so much in the last several years, and actually, I don't miss very much of it -- certainly not soda, which I haven't *been able* to drink in over twenty years.   It made me sick to my stomach.  I'm very glad to see food corporations responding to customer interest (Panera, Nestle, etc.)  If you want my money, keep it up!  Until then, I'm opting out as much as I can.

368891
Obsessed with customers?  What a joke!  Amazon is more prone to cover up mistakes than fix them.  When their on-line gift card purchase program went awry, they swiftly removed all the customer complaints from the site but took a long time to fix the problem or return purchasers' money.  If Amazon gives you a free trial of a service, don't count on what they say; they may charge your account long before the trial is up.  When gangs of amateur book critics attack an author they've never read (this is a disturbing phenomenon itself), authors say that Amazon refuses to remove the one-star reviews.  It can take years before Amazon will fix reviews erroneously attached to the wrong product, maybe not fixing it until the item is no longer for sale.  On the other hand, Amazon does randomly remove four- and five-star reviews of books, claiming that the author is behind them, even though the author insists that he or she has never met or corresponded with the reviewer.  If this is obsession with customer needs and their idea of excellence, maybe they need to obsess over their definitions.

Is it corporate welfare or a transfer money from the middle income to wealthy again? Both really!!!<br/><br/>And from the fiscal conservative Mr. Walker? Can you say hypocrite?

369386
Does this mean that big business corporations would violate the very principles of which this democracy was founded?  My AT&amp;T service is awful!  I would change providers just because of the corporations corruption, but the others just haven't been caught yet.  Terrible news that doesn't surprise me.

369397
Was this discovery made after Edward Snowden's expose?  That seems to be the implication of your wording.  But if it were part of his revelations, then credit him as it is further evidence of corruption in our Homeland Security and NSA!

What does that have to do with the slimy figure Harper is? You can't do justice to every issue in Canadian politics in one short article. This DOES accurately capture the sentiment of many Canadians that our shared PM is not trustworthy at best. This is one of the best summaries of why Harper as a controlling leader, sometimes accused of "fascism-lite". The secrecy, control and silence is THE reason I hate and fear him, and learning of these things is what pushed me away from the CPC. It's a great but short article!

369779
What is up with this endless list of excuses some readers keep making up for these people? Did you even the article? They weren't motivated by an "unstable economic future." They were doing quite well. And they sure as hell weren't motivated, out of all things, by threats to the environment! You just made all that stuff up--nothing in their backgrounds suggests these were motivating factors. I don't understand how a post like this could get 126 recommendations.<br/>I'll tell you what motivated them, since so few hear seem willing to say it:<br/>their religious beliefs. They wanted to live in a pure Islamic state, and believed that this is what the "Islamic State" would provide.<br/>Yes, Islamic State is evil, but most of the worlds' major religions and quite a few minor ones have wholeheartedly embraced evil or widespread acts of evil at one time or another.<br/>It's not that hard to figure out people ... assuming you actually want to figure it out.

Not read this column?  Really?  I don't believe that, but anyway, Marueen, you are obviously having a good time with the Don.  He is so entertaining!  Cartoonish?  Yes!  In a mafioso sort of way.  No one takes this guy seriously as a candidate and he is in his own fantasy world dreaming of the servants around calling him "Mr. President".  Americans will not elect him, so stop fretting all of you on the left and the right.  Meanwhile, pretend he is only doing a skit from SNL so he can be on the show one of the days in the not-to-distant future.

Huh?  They've been domestiCATed for about 4,000 years! Dogs fall into the same category, really read up about domestication, it's very informative and show how some breeds and individual animals preferred to be around human for companionship, not just food, so they became domesticated.

well, did she stop smoking? <br/><br/>That's what I wanted to know! If she did, his strategy, while mean, worked. If she didn't, his strategy, while clever, is ultimately ineffective. It seems kind of important to know if this anecdote is to provide an illuminating window on his work at Amazon, so it's annoying that the authors chose not to tell us. (This is a minor quibble with an otherwise fascinating, in-depth, well-written piece, the kind I'm grateful that the Times still publishes.)

This guy with his finger on the red button? God help us! I hope the country has the common sense to not vote for this joke! I wouldn't, even if my life depended on it. The real problem is that there are a substantial number of Republicans who still believe that Obama is a Kenyan, who is on the verge of delivering this country to, let me guess, the "muslims" (take your pick on country). This delusional segment of GOP voters is toxic not only for the GOP, but for the whole country. No candidate, on the GOP side, would like to call this segment out and tell them the "truth". I would not be surprised if Trump gets the nomination but it is a long battle and maybe, just maybe the GOP will come to its senses.

371601
Trump, how can I condemn thee? Let me count the ways.<br/><br/>No, there isn't enough time or space. Yet, even the condemnations to Trump are a sign that he is WINNING!<br/><br/>The media, and the tea party Republicans, have made this mess and they will have to clean it up. The media does so by treating polls as if they were votes: "If the election were held today...". But, hey, the election is not being held today. "Front runner" is a misnomer . The title ordinarily goes to someone the media thinks is in the lead based on the polls and their late night hunches over drinks on the campaign trail. It is less reliable than "the morning line" in horse race betting and far, far more damaging. Stop it.<br/><br/>What we have is a bus load of Republican candidates, none of whom is courageous enough to offer true leadership and a new direction (must placate the base first, you see) with the loudest, most inflammatory mouth getting the most attention. Plus, most in the media think that Trump means it when he says he can spend hundreds of millions of his own money on the race if he wants to. Don't bet on it. It is easier to separate a POW from his finger nails than it is to a rich man from his mountains of money. Trump is bluffing and the media has fallen for it because they like, no love, the storyline.<br/><br/>Clearly there is unfocused outrage across the land. There always is, in varying degrees. Trump's only "policy" to deal with it is to get him to do our winning for us by being the great, wonderful guy he is.

371604
What?  I thought the only racists in the nation were those evil, white cracker southerners who are responsible for all our nation's problems?  Do you mean to tell me that all those harder working than natives immigrants, who have dominated major US cities for over 150 years are vicious murdering racists too?  Like Kennedy's tribe in Boston who threw bricks through school bus windows that hit little black girls ... and then Johno was fantasized into a paragon of racial tolerance and his "hate everyone else" group along with him in order to fit the larger Democratic party's mythological narrative.  And well we can't talk about the fact that wave after wave of super racist immigrants continue to take over our cities and get special "cultural diversity" dispensation to not hire blacks, or for that matter browns or whites that are not from their specific ethnic group.  But rather "immigrant nation", oh so 'innovative' immigrant business owners have been granted a special salad bowl, diaspora Sanctuary City right to set up chain migrations of illegals that they can use as the equivalent of slaves.  The fact that all this immigration "integration of the global labor market" and free trade outsourcing of industrial jobs is devastating to blacks of course can not be discussed!  It must be "covered" by filling our consciousness with how bad things used to be, so that we can't see the current day only slightly more complex discriminations and exploitation riggings of our 1%.

Good review, but what's to say? Some Trump followers are there for the circus. But others think he's the ringmaster not the clown. The sad thing is that the latter believe that a POTUS can wave a wand and get things done... Congress? Fugetaboutit! Another imnplication is that Obama failed to deport all illegals because he didn't want to. I wish such people would check how the GOP Congress has cut funding for border and ICE officers. Such cuts force a POTUS to prioritize. Obama prioritized the deprotation of criminals. Duh!

But does Amazon really reward employees accordingly, proportionally to their merit and production?  Probably not.  What the real business model of too much of our nation's history has been, that is now returning with a vengeance, is many varieties of slave plantations where workers work over-hard to produce value, and then their business owner or major stockholder nobility steals most of the added value that the workers produced.  And then often fire them a few years later in order to hire a lower paid entry-level more naive slave!  And then our uber leaders wonder why employees are disloyal and steal, take their next "big idea" discoveries and blue prints and sell them to the Chinese, or their American equally mendacious corporate competitors.

Yes, it's all show biz, isn't it? We want an entertainer, not someone with actual experience working with leaders in foreign countries - allies and otherwise. Not someone with experience in the white house, senate and as a cabinet member. Not a survivor of venomous attacks (Whitewater? Benghazi? and now e-mails that were NOT classified?). The GOP choices are all entertainers - and simply speaking one's mind qualifies Rush as well as Trump or Bush Again...as little actual mind as they possess. <br/><br/>Are we to wonder why our problems are not solved, when we want entertainment, and not the 'boring' work of statesmanship to result?<br/><br/>Perfect? Certainly not...in fact, she's another politician playing the game that we've all been a part of creating: posturing and calculation over gutsy leadership. But every Republican option is for making life harder on those in trouble. But in an attaining (anger is fun!) way.<br/><br/>The least of the evils is the best we'll be able to do, and the GOP seems to enjoy the dismantling of a once-great nation. For a tax break.

When the "Meet the Beatles" album came out in, what, '64? I was a sophomore in HS. A friend had a party in his folks basement. Maybe 7' tall ceiling with stuff hanging down, dirt floor, much debris and a turntable and a copy of the album. Occasionally the album would be flipped over, but nothing else played all night long and there were throngs of kids in and out of the place. It remains one of the best and most memorable parties of my life. Of interest to the younger today would be how the industry could build demand for music. We knew the new album would be released at a certain time/place and there were no other sources for it. How different today! The Beatles were fabulous but there was so much fabulous music in the 60's.

Something new everyday: half an hour?  I've read about/seen clips of this event countless times over the years but learned just now that those guys performed for only 30 minutes.  What a rip.  Think I'd have been screaming 'REFUND!'  I wonder where The Stones are playing tonight?

As the saying goes: What's this 'we' stuff?<br/><br/>The recurring proclamation of the 'death of the novel' is a shibboleth. It marks you as a member of the intelligentsia, or the literati, or the intellectual coterie. It's not political; both left and right indulge in it. But it's simple dogma. And snobbery - 'none of the novels being produced today are worthy of my rarefied taste.' WS Gilbert nailed it: <br/><br/>'Of course you will pooh-pooh whatever's fresh and new,  and declare it's crude and mean,<br/>For Art stopped short in the cultivated court of the Empress Josephine.<br/>And ev'ryone will say,<br/>As you walk your mystic way,<br/>"If that's not good enough for him which is good enough for me,<br/> Why, what a very cultivated kind of youth this kind of youth must be!" '<br/><br/>Defining terms: An art form is 'dead' only when no one either creates it or partakes of it anymore. The book review list of bestsellers indicate the novel is still very much alive. Someone needs to tell the poor deluded souls who keep churning out these corpses, not to mention the readers who refuse to bury them. And by that definition there is no such thing as a truly dead art form. (A looser definition - a dead art form as one in which past works are still consumed, but which no one produces anymore - might include epic poetry and verse drama. Attempts have been made to revive both but haven't really gotten off the ground.)

Christine, did you have a chance last week to listen to Hillary Clinton's unscripted, completely extemporaneous remarks in New Hampshire about that state's horrible drug problem? Having recently learned that, on average, one-to-two persons die every day in that state from heroin, alone, she leaped through the flames to deliver not the speech she's originally packed, but one of intensely timely import, and which issued forth at once compassionate and constructive. Far from boring, I'd say....<br/><br/>The great -- and refreshing! -- thing about Mrs. Clinton, as with other Democratic leaders, is that she wields no Bullhorn (recall Mr. Lincoln); she does not bark out her speeches like the Republicans, Trump, Huckabee, Cruz, Perry, Paul, Santorum..., -- as if the rest of us are either so passive or so stupid that we need their pick-me-up.<br/><br/>For me -- and for tens of millions of other sensible types -- Ease and Soft-Spoken are vastly preferred to Hyper and Loud-Mouthed.

Ok, this goes back to workers being asked to thing like "owners," but do they get a golden parachute when they leave? No, instead, they find they are indentured and cannot leave until they "payoff" the cost of their fare to escape the potato famine!  And, as soon as they build this magnificent model, it will be outsourced and American workers castigated for being too "expensive" and "too highly" skilled for such jobs.  I too have always worked 60-70 hour weeks by choice but this is ridiculous.  Where else in the world are workers toiling "until they get the work done" for the same compensation as a 40 hour week? Oh, I forgot, the greed of American labor allows them to own one percent of the wealth.  <br/><br/>Wake up American ingenuity and fight for your worth, your innovation and intellectual property because this is Ayn Rand in reverse.  You are being coerced and no matter how many problems you solve, no matter how brilliant your talent, no matter that two people in a family now work a combined 100 hours per week when one job of 40 hours a week could raise a family of yore, you can't innovate your way out of servitude.  We are workers until we have enough to live off the means of our capital. I am sick of traveling the world and seeing people with more time and money to spend with their families and coming home a nation of exhausted Americans whose intentions and hearts are pure.

Are people going to go after Amazon the way they went after Walmart a few years ago?  I think it was easier to boycott Walmart because a lot of the boycotters didn't  shop there much anyway.  Amazon is a way of life for so many shoppers; it's hard to give it up.  Of course, Jeff Bezos knows this.<br/><br/>But we can at least cut back!   Even if you don't want to go cold turkey, cut back, and that will help send a message.   From now on, when people think of Amazon, they should think "awful company", first and foremost.  

372978
Really??  Yellow NY cabs are awful!  They smell and the other day the driver for the cab I was in couldn't find LGA.  Also, the drivers are rude and miserable.  Have you ever waited in the taxi line at JFK?  This is why alternatives like Uber are thriving.  <br/><br/>Please keep taking the cabs.  More Uber for the rest of us......

But how do you really feel, Gary?  <br/><br/>I totally get what you mean, except for the part about the theremin.  In case readers are not familiar with it, think Star Trek theme song melody -- the odd, shrill, almost-voice-like sound that floats above the rest of the music.  <br/><br/>In a practiced hand it can sound like a cat squealing in agony -- and a theremin can be played VERY loud.  It's also used in spooky movies -- the kind of music you might hear in a haunted graveyard.  <br/><br/>Don't set the theremin as your standard of noise acceptability!  It's loud, scary, and in some instances, has been known to wake the dead.

Who is the "us", in "they hate us", Sophia? And who is the "they"? I'm pretty sure you cannot be referring to skin color, since, as I'm sure we all know, Ben Carson is black. Or does it come as a shock to you that SOME black people are Republican, although admittedly, they are clearly in the minority. Think Colin Powell! I always hoped that he would be the first black man to run for the Presidency, and win, too!

Know why he was raised by a single mother? Because his mother was a bit off and chose poorly in the garden of love. Twice! His dad and step dad were both poor father figures. Yes,his mother tragically died prematurely and his grand parents raised him., but. He led a privileged upbringing, attending private schools throughout his education. Google up Punaho Academy and check out what the tuition is. Hardly a up by his bootstraps story. Some people do hold his half black/half white background against him, but a lot of his misery is self inflicted.

What will our glorious school systems be measuring next?<br/>In horror, I can only imagine.  I can't wait for the debate uproar over what the "Average-Length" is.<br/>Will they merely be sending letters home?

Return to your knitting.

What exactly are the ways that repubs are trying to disenfranchise people who don't agree them?  Can you be specific- give some examples? Do you mean because they are advocating a voter ID?<br/>Is it anything like Lois Lerner IRS scandal where she deliberately prevented Tea Party groups from filing their 501(c).  Ahead of the 2012 elections! That's why you didn't hear much from the Tea Party during the elections.<br/>Coming from Chicago you should know about voting fraud! The dems are notorious for that. Even Obama jokes about it.

373403
Can we all be a bit more honest?<br/><br/>Yes, he is incompetent in many ways. But de Blasio did NOT shut down the shelters. <br/><br/>Are we that blind to see Bloomberg's few really really bad decisions?!<br/><br/>And why didn't you fools vote for Lhota who had the subways running in less than 2 weeks after Hurricane Sandy??<br/><br/>How many on this board actually even voted I wonder?

To any workers that buy into this, I have to ask: WHY?<br/><br/>What's REALLY in it for you?  Not better wages, not respect.  Heck, the system is designed from the ground up to foster and glorify NO RESPECT for the worker!  In every decent, workable conract, there is a fair trade, equitable exchange... there is none here.  It's like you truly have to *want* to be badly hurt and damaged, and it's OK with you.  If all of the cheerleaders for this system are really just desperate works with a forced smile on their face, it would be good to know that.  Perhaps a follow up article with much more focus on the workers' point of view is needed.  I asume that much of it would have to be anonymous reporting.<br/><br/>I worked over seventeen years for a major Fortune 20 high tech company.  It used to be one of the best places in the world to work. By the time I left, it was openly cultivated white collar slavery - and everyone knew it, including the management that whipped people along mercilessly.  Everyone was Rah-Rah, at least until they left.  Then stories of physical, mental, and emotional pain come rushing out like a lanced boil.  Anguish, lost health, permanent damage done to body and mind.  It's all real, it does happen.  This type of work place has REAL consequences on workers, which is why many developed nations ban such practices.<br/><br/>As for all those that complain about unions, this is why we had them.  This is why companies lobbied against them.  They protect people from... Indecency.

After reading this, I come back to the same question I always do - who does this style of work environment truly benefit?<br/><br/>I'm really left with only one person - Jeff Bezos. It doesn't seem as if employees benefit from it - not with the incredibly callous attitudes and treatment of those with personal illnesses and family disruption, it seems caused in large part by this so-called work environment.<br/><br/>People deserve better than be ground up and spit out of this meat grinder like so much hamburger. In fact, this almost seems like the next evolutionary step beyond the Wal-Mart work environment. And all for what - so consumers can have their Chinese-sweatshop manufactured trinkets in 23 minutes or less and then thrown them away 12 and a half minutes later for the next thing that catches our insatiable fancy on the Amazon website?<br/><br/>I wish as a people that we would learn that we deserve better for ourselves and that we can achieve a life without the need to work for the modern day equivalent of the meat packing factory from Upton Sinclair's book "The Jungle." (Never read this book? Available in paperback or Kindle on Amazon!)

You're not aware that the MTA is run by Albany, and yet you use it to dismiss de Blasio?! Do your homework before you jump to conclusions.

374139
Hasn't Amazon ever heard of pay for overtime? Company expenses paid by the company, not the employee? How does Bezos get away with this? He shouldn't! Which politicians has he bought off? Amazon sounds like the ISIS of retail. Why are we getting all these fanatics in almost everything lately. This is total unhealthy for our collective future!

374205
Uh, what planet are the authors and commenters living on? Not in my neighborhood, which is clean, booming, crime is down, homelessness is no higher than it's been... my only complaints are about the school system (overcrowded and overtested) and the subway system (just overcrowded). But those are both longer-term fixes and not totally within his control (to raise funds for school construction, I'd favor raising taxes--yes, including mine!--but that giant bully Cuomo won't allow it, nevermind funding the MTA capital plan).

374206
Where is crime down? I live in in Clinton Hill with $3M+ brownstones and in less than a week we have had a stabbing, a drive by shooting, a killing and more drugs sold on a corner than you could imagine.  This is only what the 88th precinct reports! We all know that they prevaricate, so.... We are NOT better off and I am a black female Democrat, not a Republican, check my voting record, come visit me and see what I look like! What I am is a realist, de Blasio is not a good Mayor! That Uber nonsense, was another indication! Uber picks up people like me, yellow taxis do not.

People are crying at their desks? What kind of wimps is this country producing!?! Unless your dog just got hit by a car or a loved one died, you don't cry at your desk. Honestly this is not indicative of a workplace problem, this is indicative of an employee problem - it should be resolved by cutting them loose. They need counseling more than they need a job.

Will Netanyahu just leave?  Most of the world got over the horrors of WWll ages ago.  His aging supporters do not represent the world as it is today.  The settlers are fundamentalist crazies upsetting the world balance, just as the nutcase right wingers deflect attention away from Americas true issues - the economy, jobs, infrastructure, education, the role of police in civil society.  <br/><br/>Interestingly I have noticed that my one, now quite old, Holocaust survivor friend is much more worldly and open than his kids, who were weaned on Never Again, and did not stop to think the persecution mentality does noone any good, hey there have been a gazillion Holocausts and civizilization continues to limp along.  Why can we not just get along!  Diplomacy is less dramatic than arms but lots easier in the long run.

Mistakes? You are too kind by half! Willful ignorance is straight up criminal behavior, ranking with things like depraved indifference and negligent mayhem.<br/><br/>As far as the gas tax is concerned, this is a fading horse and it's a non-starter. Hybrids, electrics and increasing use of public transportation all but eliminate the requirements of long term, stable financing associated with a stable tax base. As far as the rich whiners who keep complaining about how much it costs to live in New Jersey, get0 used to it. You don't make fifteen cents an hour, and neither does anyone else outside the Gulags. This is what it costs to run the place. And you can't solve your problems by foisting onto someone else's back or moving away from them, hey are common problems associated with being human and (at least partially civilized. They simply follow us wherever we go).

"forced to endure the challenges"<br/><br/>How in the world do you imagine that would work? <br/><br/>BTW, HRC grew up as pretty much a commoner. Unlike Jeb!, for instance.

You want more candidates?  Isn't the current process enough of a circus for you?  Mrs. Clinton is supposed to connect with the average voter with a swarm of news media following her, who will cattily report on what she eats and what she says and find all the negative comments they can among those trying to speak with her.  What a way to choose a president!

375595
So is increased longevity just an American problem? Are the British, Swiss, French, Japanese, Australians, etc. still dying at 60 on average? No, of course not, if anything,  Japan and most European countries have longer life expectancies than Americans. That coupled with much lower birthrates for 3-4 decades now, their state retirement policy-making is in fact even more difficult. Their numbers are even more unfavourable in the context of sustainability. <br/><br/>So what those countries have are civil discussions and calculations based on actuarial science. They recognise what the numbers mean and make adjustments when necessary. What they don't  have is one side of the aisle acting purely out of ideology, not willing to compromise or evaluate offers, willing to stifle policy-making, hell-bent on destroying an insurance program that is only benefiting "the lazy and the moochers" in their views. <br/><br/>So let's have a discussion about increased life spans, worker/retiree ratios and the like. By all means. Will Cruz be there? Will Jeb! be there? Will Rubio be there? No, because they are not interested in policy making at all. 

375613
And? Too many of these "dems are more this way and repubs are more that way" statistics are pointless other than to fuel the "us vs. them" that is so destructive to us, an atmosphere more appropriate for a college football game (rah rah us!) rather than life (us is dems and repubs). It also says nothing about the individual and their own marriage, which is what the individual should care about.

375626
More steps than Apple Pay?   With most banks, it takes 10 min. on the phone to associate a credit card with Apple Pay.   So armed, I went to my local Trader Joe's (the only place I regularly shop that takes it).   Instead of the swipe-anytime that I'd do with my credit card, I had to wait until the checker finished, then did the Apple Pay transaction..... tick tick tick tick, after 45 seconds or so, it put a cryptic error on the checker's screen.   Out comes the credit card.   Way to create frictionless payments, propellor-heads!

375759
Why is this still an issue? Bernie Sanders supporters need to stop focusing on the tactics of #BlackLivesMatters and start focusing on the tactics of police forces across this country. Bernie set a fine example: he stepped aside and let these women speak; he listened to the complaints of their community; he addressed their complaints and adapted his campaign; and he's moving FORWARD. He didn't apologize. He didn't cave. He didn't ignore them. He LISTENED! Yet here we all are, talking past each other.<br/><br/>This whole thing is quickly becoming a media-sponsored red herring. The Bernie Sanders campaign is built around the rejection of identity politics in favor of a uniting economic message. Why are his supporters ignoring that?<br/><br/>I'm with Charles on one point, here: anyone who says that Black Lives Matter has lost their support because a couple of rogue members barnstormed that rally never really supported the movement in the first place.

375915
People are saying that workplace abuse could never be so egregious, humiliating and ego-eviscerating that it could lead to tears?  What kind of soulless sociopaths is this country producing!?!  Honestly, this is not indicative of a comprehension problem; this is indicative of a major personality disorder --  it should be resolved by getting intensive psychotherapy.  They need professional help more than they need to spread their angry message to others.

376003
 Who would have done such a thing?<br/>St. Reagan if I recall!

376077
Why all this concern about what Iowans think?  Recall that Santorum swept the Iowa primary for the Republicans last election.  The record for Iowa voters picking the candidates is average to poor at best.  The only record for Iowans is that of being out of touch with most of the urban parts of the country where most people now live.  This idea of somehow people in Iowa knowing something others do not know is simply silly.  Why does anyone have to eat a corn dog (check the nutritional content!) to show they have leadership skills?

"America needs more companies like Amazon that demand more from employees and rewards them accordingly"?<br/><br/>The same old mantra, right out of the the investment banking and big law firm manual!  Or some satire our to Dickens! THIS counts as "new thinking"?  <br/><br/>"Should we force them to work forty hour weeks..."<br/><br/>Nobody is forcing anyone paid a salary to work to curtail work, but some people do also want to have families, lives, and some semblance of balance in work/life!  <br/><br/>That's why Europeans, in general, are so much happier than Americans with all the work-manic and accompanying addictions (drinking, speed, 'energy' drinks, violent sports, general animosity, even hostility towards others, political candidates who prey on all these manias and the culture of resentment!)

Spirituality - wha? How about just getting a how are you, how is your family, from a doctor? My surgeon actually stood behind one of his clerks I was on the phone with (I could hear him) and yelled "This is taking too much time, too much time!!" over an over. I was asking that a form for Return to Work be modified for my specific conditions, instead of just the pre-written sheet the doctor just signed..<br/>I don't need spirituality - I do need a bit of human interaction. Just a bit!

With all of the initiatives heaped on schools over the last ten years, why in the world are we asking them to be the fat police? This is bad government at its worst. Tell the state legislature to try a different tack, because this is a trifecta of stupid, over reaching, and harmful to both children and schools. Enough!

Thank you!

Did you read the web site that you linked to?  One variable that was NOT addressed was income, which many studies has shown influences happiness once a threshold of income has ben attained.  Although the Wilcox web site states<br/>"What about education and income? Given the centrality of social class in predicting better family outcomes for Americans, might the partisan difference in marital happiness be linked to these measures of socioeconomic status? No. The figure above suggests that socioeconomic differences do not help explain the Republican advantage."<br/>That figure shows that adjusting for race, the difference shrinks to 3%.  But If you look at the figure, there is NO controlling for income as an independent variable.  Clearly a deliberate omission.  It is reasonable to conclude that adjusting for income would shrink these difference even further since it is well know that the more wealth a family has, the greater the probability of voting Republican.<br/><br/>Given the shoddy data analysis, the conclusion is that this study and the NYtimes amplification are click bait.  Way to go NYTimes!

Who could ask for anything more on a beautiful Sunday afternoon?  Day-Spieth in the final pairing of a Major just two strokes apart when it began?  It was a classic duel between two of the most talented golfers of this age and it didn't disappoint.  In the end, Jason Day is no longer the best golfer never to win a Major and Spieth, through his humility and magnanimous praise for his victorious competitor, continued to show the world why he is the consummate champion even in defeat.  Congratulations to both warriors for a battle well fought!

Just How Tall Can Roller Coasters Get? By Mekado Murphy<br/>There are five roller coasters in the world that classify under the category of 'giga coaster.'  Intimidating, right?  These coasters emphasize height rather than speed, reaching heights between 300-399 feet, with near-equal length drops.  Again, intimidating.  I love roller coasters, and this article sounds like a challenge.  Four of these roller coasters are in North America, the fifth being in Japan.  Located in Charlotte, NC, Fury 325 is the tallest coaster, flying to 325 feet in height, and a top speed of 95mph, also the fastest of the four North American coasters.  The other three coasters are: Millennium Force in Sandusky Ohio, Intimidator 305 in Doswell, VA, and Leviathan in Ontario, Canada.  All of these roller coasters drop down over 300 feet, twist and turn, go up and down wildly, and provide a thrill ride for every rider.  Imagine flying down a mountain, going up, and down, feeling weightless.  These are the seemingly unfathomable thrills these roller coasters provide.  All you have to do is ride one!  I think I'll make a goal and ride every one of them someday, and more, as this is something new, so many more will eventually follow in pursuit, and even break the sky-reaching limit that these roller coasters have now placed in the industry.

This week I was interested in “Just How Tall Can Roller Coasters Get?” I was intrigued by this article because I live by, and have a seasons pass to, the theme park, Carowinds. I clicked on the article and the first thing I saw was a picture of one of my favorite roller coasters to ride, the Fury 325. I did know that the Fury was the tallest and fastest giga coaster in the world, but I did not know that it was one of the only giga coasters in the world. I learned that there are only five! I am amazed and thankful that I get the chance to ride it. As for the description, they left out the part where start going up the hill, have an instant of regret, and then as you are falling you are having the time of your life. This article left me wanting to go and ride every single one of the giga coasters and experience them for myself.

Why do we still trade with this country?  We made their resurgence with our greed for products made cheaply.  <br/><br/>China is unquestionably one of the worlds biggest violators of human rights, but we prop them up by buying goods.  So aren't we also guilty of human rights abuses?  China has unquestionably used cyber terrorism against us.  That in my mind is an act of war.  Why are we trading with a country who has committed acts of war against us?<br/><br/>The answer lies in our personal greed for cheap products and our corporate greed for excessive wealth.  It's an old case, but yahoo basically executed Shi Tao so they could keep themselves in the Chinese market.  <br/><br/>The United States has abundant land, abundant resources, and supposedly a weak job market, can't we do it ourselves??<br/><br/>Greed and arrogance are killing his country.  BUY USA!!!!!  things might cost a little more, but theoretically your taxes should go down, because it's providing a job to someone also contributing to the tax base.    More jobs, less taxes, better quality control, hmmmm, sounds good to me.<br/> ....but apparently a lot of people think Trump should be president and the "greed is good" mantra resonates.  We idolize excessive wealth and not the general welfare of our fellow citizens.

Why? Because sanctions on Iran will fall apart as Russia and China conclude the United States is not serious about a compromise with Tehran<br/>NOT SO!<br/>Russia wants to sell arms to Iran.  Without actual money, with what can Iran pay?<br/>China wants to buy oil from Iran.  But what does Iran want with Chinese money? What can Iran purchase with Chinese money?  If isolated from the rest of the world's economies the only thing Iran may use Chinese money for is to buy Chinese consumer goods.<br/>Do NOT underestimate the extreme power that US sanctions have on Iran and those who would deal with it!

DOESN'T EVERYBODY REALIZE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ACHIEVED “PEACE IN OUR TIME?”<br/><br/>But only for the next ten years and then Iran can have nuclear weapons in accordance with this agreement!<br/><br/>Iran does not have intercontinental ballistic missile delivery systems, but they can afford to rent a van for a suicide bomber instead!<br/><br/>This treaty is a great diplomatic victory for the Obama Administration!<br/><br/>The USA, France, Germany, England, China and Russia did all get together and then all agreed in essence to "Give away everything Iran wants in return for a ten year pause before Iran is allowed to have nuclear weapons with the capability to destroy the USA!"<br/><br/>The US agrees to release Iran from Iran’s treaty obligations under the existing non-nuclear-proliferation treaty that Iran previously signed!<br/><br/>The US agrees to lift trade sanctions against Iran that were implemented against Iran for Iran’s capture of the US embassy in Iran and Iran's failure to comply with Iran’s obligations that Iran agreed to comply with as a part of the previous non-nuclear-proliferation agreement that Iran signed! This will give Iran the economic capability to arm and finance many more religious fanatics around the world. How will the USA ever deal with a bunch of nuclear armed religious fanatics?<br/><br/>The US agrees to allow Iran to have Nuclear Weapons ten years after this treaty is agreed and ratified by all of the governmental parties to this agreement!

Is it really Bernie's responsibility to educate the public as you suggest? Doesn't that belong in Civics class? You remember Civics, right? Ah, they don't teach that any more! It is subversive. Gives the hoi polloi ideas about democracy.<br/><br/>I am sorry for your cynicism. There are people like us who are afraid to hope for change. If we don't support Bernie out of fear of disappointment, we guarantee he will not be elected. Become part of the solution, friend. Bernie is right: if we stand together, we win. <br/><br/>I truly think this coming election is a fight for the soul of the country. If we lose, there will be no going back. The supreme court will be packed with a firewall of conservatives for the next 25 years or more. They will overturn all of the gains since the New Deal, and we will be serfs again. The only choice we will have will be one Marie Antoinette would recognize.

Lurleen,<br/><br/>Guess what?  Israel does have nuclear weapons.  Lot's of them. Thank the<br/>Lord for that.  And if Iran  attacks them they will respond appropriately.<br/>I see a possible nuclear holocaust in the future!

What part of TWENTY PERCENT of the gross domestic product of the United States produced in our region wasn't clear?  Folks outside the northeast just love to hate "eastern elites", don't they?<br/><br/>My sister lives in Crockett County, Texas, (population 3,812).  Why should I pay to subsidize the roads, post offices, infrastructure and other services of residents who choose a "lifestyle" of living in rural Texas?  Why don't they just move to Dallas and find jobs there?  Why should I pay to subsidize anything in Texas, for that matter?  I never use it!<br/><br/>Perhaps you believe that revenue from your state actually pays for all the infrastructure you use.  That could be the only rationale for an argument that is - as you folks like to say - "all hat and no cattle".

People are repulsed by abortion - of this there is no doubt - but how do we as a complex, democratic, free society, regulate it while ensuring fair treatment for women and the best possible medical practice?There is an organization called Democrats for Life which advocates for protection for the unborn, prenatal care for women, access to contraception, and support for maternal and paternal family leave. Former Governor Robert Casey from Pennsylvania is one of the leaders of this movement within the Democratic Party. This group represents those repelled by our libertarian attitudes towards abortion, supportive of the rights of women and men to make conscience based choices, and, most compelling, offers practical, real-world compromises.Let us stop regarding unborn human lives as medical waste, and let's refrain from abusive name-calling on all sides of the argument.<br/>The tapes capture the chilling, horrifying reality of abortion, but they do not (yet) show any actual deals made, contracts signed, or funds changing hands, so it's hard too see how Planned Parenthood could be accused of trafficking in baby parts. The tapes nonetheless strongly indicate that the leaders of Planned Parenthood can be swayed by mercenary considerations. After all, Dr. Lamborghini made the sales rep pick up the lunch check! Thanks to Ross Douthat for taking on this troubling issue.

No laws broken? What did these people live on aside from milking all that social services has to offer? Their Father clearly stated that he was indifferent to employment (I am being kind) and so it is ok to have 7 children and have the state support them?  Really?<br/>This all seems suspect, especially the fact that they were home schooled, so obviously their ditz of a Mother had to be  certified by the DOE. So many red flags here as to what was going on (the Mother is a poster child for domestic violence, let's get real here!).<br/>Yes, I know I am suppose to say the obvious, how remarkable are the children.....such creativity.....so resourceful....but i am too deeply disturbed by this film to see the love. I see an abusive parent, in every way possible, including a travesty of the social service  system

Why is Bernie Sanders getting so much attention from voters - young &amp; old of all ethnicities? He doesn’t waste time on the trivia that much of the media assumes we want in order to be 'entertained' or that corporate owners of the media hope will lull us into brainless robots. FIRST - get it straight. Bernie is a Democratic Socialist! Democratic Socialism provides opportunities for all voices to be heard, not just the voices of a privileged few. We are no longer a Democratic nation, we have devolved to an Oligarchy. Look that up and start calling candidates of the GOP Oligarchists - which they are! As for Hilary's or Bernie's (or for that matter Donald's) hair. Who gives a rat's @$$?!! When college educated youth cannot find decent jobs, yet are burdened with enormous college loans that will prevent them from ever owning a home or being able to afford having children, when senior citizens are in danger of losing social security benefits they have spent their lives paying for, when public schools are turned over to (less effective – check the research) profit making corporations, when unions cannot protect workers, when racism engulfs the nation like a tsunami &amp; global environmental crisis is denied, when Native peoples have what few parcels of sacred land left to them stolen by mining corps. Why the %*$$ are you focused on HAIR???? Get real and cover issues with honesty &amp; integrity.

Do we have the same kid??? Mine goes through periods of various obsessions. Currently it is Pokemon and I swear, she is speaking a completely different language. I've had to tell her, "I honestly have no idea what that means" when she rhapsodizes about a particular character evolution. (That part I've picked up!) <br/><br/>She has run into problems relating to kids who aren't into whatever is her obsession (Minecraft, Pokemon, Warrior cats, Percy Jackson, etc., etc.) It did cause her a lot of social isolation in 2nd and 3rd grade. I've talked to her about remembering that everyone loves Pokemon as much as she does, so she has to be flexible and keep other people's interest in mind. She is a very strong introvert, and as a consequence, her interests tend to be limited in number but very deep in her knowledge of them.<br/><br/>Fortunately, she's now in a school where all the kids are as equally into Geek culture as she is and she's found her home with others who share her passions.

How do young teenagers get on international flights by themselves? Maybe I don't understand how common unaccompanied children get on international flights but it seems like this is a huge problem. When I travel to South America with our children without my wife (or vise versa) I am required to have a notarized letter from my spouse that the children have permission to travel with me. It is just crazy that a 13 year old can get on a plane by themselves and jet off to Turkey!

379085
OMG what is with all the first wave feminist and/or poor lil' immigrant critiques here? So sure, we're talking about ISIS, or ISIL or Daesh or whatever, but this is totes a teenage girl thing! Whoever my parents and teachers don't fancy, that's who I want to be with! If this were 1969 they'd be running off to follow Black Sabbath touring the Midlands. Of course this lot fancy themselves "serious" girls, so they are all about the "serious" lads, "the brothers who pray", but really, enough with this being society's fault already, this is all about being boy crazy.

So, Bernie is an "evil" socialist, huh? LOL<br/><br/>He's our 21st century FDR (Democratic Socialist and one of US's top three Presidents). <br/><br/>I offer this analogy to prove that not only is Bernie not evil, his inclusive, socio-economic ideology (ALL Americans at the table, what a freakin radical concept!) and entire platform are a perfect bulls eye. <br/><br/>*********************************************************************<br/><br/>When water (life) does not flow freely throughout the land, it eventually becomes a stagnant pond, full of mosquitoes and disease and death. <br/><br/>The rest of the parched earth dies from drought (e.g. California).<br/><br/>The same is true of wealth, jobs, opportunities, income and resources within a society.<br/><br/>ALL of Life is nothing but redistribution at every level.<br/><br/>The Rich have built a private dam to hoard all the wealth of America's Great River. <br/><br/>Those below the Great Dam are dying of thirst and starvation.<br/><br/>Money, like blood, must circulate - redistribute - or the social structure dies.<br/><br/>Redistribution is the essence of life on earth.<br/><br/>*************************************************************<br/><br/>Pathological capitalism is killing you, me, the world. In the end, it will consume itself.<br/><br/>We need to OPEN the floodgates or we're done.<br/><br/>Bernie passionately believes in social equity, righting the hideous, systemic wrongs, abundant LIFE for ALL.<br/><br/>If that makes him "evil" then put me down in favor of "evil".

379307
I thought it amounted to a "Can you hear me NOW?!" moment. I, too, thought Bernie handled it well and at least *he* heard what was being said, appreciated the anger behind the need, and did what he could to address the issue. That beats the bejeebus out of all other responses to date.

Socrates -- Can't you ever think about anything besides how much you hate Bush and the Republicans? Yes, the invasion of Iraq was a misconceived disaster. But the important thing at this point is to figure out what to do next, not to keep hammering on blame for past mistakes.<br/><br/>The thing is, there are other issues here -- more important issues -- besides the Iraq war and who is to blame. In particular, there is the question of whether it was really a good idea for Great Britain to show off its superior moral virtue by inviting millions of Muslims to settle there. That's a question that actually has some relevance to what will happen in the future! If there were any chance you might buck the progressive party line concerning the unqualified gloriousness of diversity I'd be really interested in hearing what you had to say, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

Why are their parents / families still in England ? This stuff doesn't happen in a vaccum - if they hate Western culture so much - time to go !! Time to start shipping all family members back from were they came... lets go out to first cousins ( maybe second cousins) - immediate revokation of EU / citizenship - immediate deportation .. this nonsense would stop real fast.. !  Lets also take a look at the people that are influencing them in their communities - lets round them up.. (and ship back ) - !!

Avery, socialism doesn't preclude your earning over 200K and buying all your goodies (I assume you meant 190K) -  but can't you care about other people too?  It's not "either-or."  I too like having stuff!  But there's also room left in my brain for EMPATHY. <br/><br/>I am willing to give a little more (and no, I'm not in your income bracket) in return for the knowledge that it's going to make life better for people who really need it.  It gives me PEACE OF MIND and that makes me happier..... I dunno, is that logical enough for you?

So likability is the most important quality in a President? After all, you personally are going to hang out with the Pres on a regular basis. Please!!!!!<br/>And lest you forget, W was considered likable and look where that got us.

Walter Bally wrote, “How can you call yourself serious when your sole objective is to take someone else's money?”<br/><br/>Bernie believes that the wealthy and corporations have to accept their responsibilities if they want to continue to enjoy the benefits of America. I agree! This is how absurd the situation is right now:<br/><br/>Millionaires and billionaires pay a lower tax rate than nurses and firemen and many large corporations that earn billions in profit pay little or no taxes.<br/><br/>More than $100 billion is lost each year because corporations and wealthy individuals offshore their money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.<br/><br/>About $60 billion is lost annually because corporations that send jobs overseas receive tax breaks.<br/><br/>More than $11 billion is lost each year because profitable oil, gas and coal companies receive tax breaks and subsidies.<br/><br/>The military-industrial complex, Big Pharma, Big Agra, and other industries receive billions in subsidies and corporate welfare.<br/><br/>Hedge fund managers and private equity managers benefit from the carried interest loophole.<br/><br/>Taxpayers subsidize Walmart and other corporations by providing their employees with Medicaid, food stamps, and other government assistance because workers are paid starvation wages.<br/><br/>There is no reason why we cannot enact a modest financial transaction tax, when we tax goods and services at 6, 7, 8 percent.

Carolyn - so let me get this right - Bloomberg made  the city "harder" by making it more efficient and steering it to a record number of jobs while maintaining crime reduction???  Yikes!

Do you know if this type of immersion program exists in the UK? My 6 year old son has SM (I write about it here <a href="http://invisibletotheeye.com/2015/03/19/selective-mutism-in-dreams-and-in-reality/)" title="http://invisibletotheeye.com/2015/03/19/selective-mutism-in-dreams-and-in-reality/)" target="_blank">http://invisibletotheeye.com/2015/03/19/selective-mutism-in-dreams-and-i...</a> and I have a feeling this type of program would work better for him than just working one-on-one with a therapist. I think these kids get encouraged by being in an environment where they, for once, don't have to feel different from everybody else. Thanks for this article!

really?  that's it?  china acts as an enemy at every...single...turn (read the news, you goofs) and obama says 'you better NOT or I will send you a LETTER saying you better not!".

@Ana Marie Cox - did you really just ask, and THEN defend a question about a candidate's hair? How exactly did you did you get this job? "There's a gendered reason." Oh riiiiight - as in the most heavily favored non-incumbent presidential candidate in modern US history might fail to win the nomination/election because voters are too concerned with her hair/gender; and by asking this question, you're doing your part to keep the electorate informed on the issues that matter. Is that about right? Dear god. Send your CV to Fox News, or maybe E! Television.  Seems like that might be a better fit for you.  People always care about a candidate's appearance. Men too.  See the Nixon vs. Kennedy Debate circa 1960.  Rather than ask questions to uncover the true political beliefs and affiliations of the candidates, let's spend our time lamenting the shallow nature of human perception why don't we? You're a hack.

"To make Mexico pay for the wall?"<br/>Donald Trump "I will make them pay!"<br/>Why waste time on trifles? Make Mexicans pay Americans for their job the do here in America. Illegals are profitable for their employer, cause this is the perfect way to avoid paying taxes. Economy suffers.<br/>Trump is a populist and fiction writer with Napoleonic plans.

Has anything changed since Saint Ronnie declared "Tear down this wall Mr Gorbachev"?<br/><br/>The players, yes, the venue, yes, but the ill-informed bombast where the Republican party sees the world as a gigantic Western movie hasn't. <br/><br/>Nuance? No clue-ance!

Will somebody explain why the US and Israel get to have as many nukes as they want and also get to tell other countries they can't have any? Obviously, I don't favor free access to nukes and wish we could get rid of all of them, but the whole idea of negotiation is to use the carrot instead of the stick. Israel's incessant whining and Netanyahu's meddling deserve a time-out instead of the lollipop the Republicans want to give them. Brats!

382013
You'd rather be coerced into paying for war, and agricultural and oil subsidies? Loan reduction or forgiveness will at least spur the economy widely and more evenly than targeted welfare for select contractors and businesses. Plus, the money paid out to the banks through zero interest and the likes of Halliburton would have ended the debt crisis 10x over! Pick your targets wisely my friend.

you are comparing fiorina and obama by imagining obama as a corporate ceo? are you a writer of fiction? please. let's imagine them next as viking warriors on a ship! who would prove themselves more capable? she's arrogant, grabs credit, and avoids responsibility. in business terms, she's inept, a joke.

The vegan waldorf mom was unhappy that your school uses animal products that she thinks are unethically obtained?  Why do you say that as though it should be shocking? Of course she's unhappy - is she not allowed to talk about it? <br/><br/>You seem to have missed the point of her criticism about wool by bringing up the need to shear sheep, at least the point she should have made: sheep are domesticated animals, they're only kept around and bred into existence so that we can exploit their bodies! If we stopped doing that we could also stop rescuing them from heat exhaustion. <br/><br/>Finally, your quip about vegan children betrays bias and a lack of research. Bias because parents generally overestimate the healthiness of their kids' diets and that's most certainly the case with the American diet (sadly poverty doesn't help with this but we could do a better job on that as well). Lack of research because although there are a few things that vegan kids are at higher risk for, the problems actually occur rarely and they can all be easily avoided by parents with even a small amount of education from a family physician. Meanwhile, kids fed a typical American diet containing meat are set up for all manner of nasty stuff from the start, from greater exposure to pathogens, mercury, etc., to the obesity and constipation that 1/3 kids suffer.

Puzzle: Are You Smarter Than 55,405 Other New York Times Readers?<br/><br/>In this article, it asks the reader a short puzzle- "...pick a number from 0 to 100, with that number representing your best guess of two-thirds of the average of all numbers chosen in the contest." At first, I was stumped. I hardly knew what the puzzle even meant. But after rereading it (several times), I understood it and started thinking of a number that would fit. At first I chose 7 because I thought that a lot of people might choose it. I took 2/3 of 7, 4.66666667, and rounded that to 5. But then I started thinking again and changed my answer to 35. After taking 2/3 of 35, I got 23. I thought this was a reasonable answer so I submit it. This is what the article then said: "So far, the average of all numbers has been 28, which means two-thirds of the average is 19 and your entry of 23 is within five of the mark. Though not the winning entry, it's still closer than about 82 percent of other readers." I was pleased. Since I was so confused at the beginning of the question, I was happy to know that I did better than 82% of the readers!<br/>I read the article that followed and it was very intriguing. It went on to say why people got the answers they did and the types of thinkers they might be. It was very interesting.

Bush did negotiate the deal, but what of it? While it's true Maliki rejected the SOFA, Obama was ready to go, was tired of dealing with Iraq and Maliki -- and so we left. The ambassador at the time will tell you that we could've kept troops in the country, could've gotten immunity for them, but the fact is that we were fed up with Maliki entirely. This never would've happen had we not invaded the country (illegally and absurdly); but that doesn't absolve an inheritor of an absurd war of all blame for the consequences of his actions thereafter.<br/><br/>What some people mean by diplomacy is simply this: Let's talk, but if you don't finally agree to what I'm asking, I'll just kill you. It's clear, though, that for you to exercise utmost leverage, the weaker power must believe that you will blast it to the Stone Age, should you feel so compelled. On Charlie Rose, Richard Haas, complaining about some of the sweeteners in the JCPOA, said the administration should've taken Republican members of Congress along to Vienna and used them as a sort of "bad cop" -- that is, as leverage.<br/><br/>However that may be, I do find it worrying that the president insists on ruling out options long in advance, almost on principle: "No ground troops!" Neither this president nor the Board knows if, at some point in the near -- or far -- future, ground troops will be needed to eliminate Islamic State. The "And what happens after that?" question can't freeze us forever from taking action to stop this nightmare.

Does anyone at the NYT understand what words like "competition" or "elite" actually mean?  You might juxtapose this article against any of your articles about economic inequality.  In order to earn a top position at a great company or firm, one needs to "win" a long, arduous and high-stakes competition against other highly-trained and highly-motivated individuals.  The winners get intellectually and financially rewarding positions; the losers get less.  This is the pursuit of excellence in a complex economic world.  People can freely choose to work in less Darwinian environments, but they should not whine about the disparity in rewards.  Really!

So after we achieve the goal to erradicate carnivorism, what are we to do with all those far animals?   Cows, pigs, chickens dont exist in nature, they have been created by humans over millenia of domestication of previous wild species.   Do they let them take over the farm?   Slaughter them all in one final holocaust?   This animals exist becasue of human need, remove that need then bye bye piggie!

How discussing the disastrous consequences of "being tough", both for the USA and the world?  And, oh yes, SOME mention of the financial costs, especially when wars are essentially marked as "TBD credit card debts" (cf. George Bush)?<br/><br/>The USA is clearly being financially drained by almost 15 years of endless wars and ever-higher military costs.  We have lots of money for arms, weaponry, and spying technology, but not enough for schools, healthcare, Social Security, and basic repair on our crumbling infrastructure.  Our nation is crumbling, and the social fabric in tatters (as witnessed by the demonizing rhetoric of the right--there's always some bogy-man to blame!)<br/><br/>And what about the human costs on our military personnel?  The press sometimes mentions that latest VA care disaster or high numbers of men and women scarred for life by PTSD, but those tend to get glossed over. <br/><br/>And is the Middle East or Africa better off for all this military adventurism?  Look at the chaos, thousands of lives lost, and an entire region utterly destabilized--and all with NO end in sight!<br/><br/>I'd like the press to ask each and every candidate, especially the tough-talkers these questions: <br/><br/>1) Evaluate the financial effects of the endless wars you're proposing;<br/>2) Explain specific measures you propose to care for our solders afterwards; 3) Explain how the world is better off for all the warfare of the last 10 years;<br/>4) Explain your plan for post-fighting reconstruction of war-torn areas.

Seriously? Obama is your hero?<br/><br/>"Mr. Obama’s Justice Department, however, convinced a Florida federal judge that even if Mr. Gilbert’s sentence was illegal, he had to remain in prison because prisoners should not be able to petition more than once for release. The “finality” of criminal cases was too important, the department argued, to allow prisoners more than one petition, even if a previous one was wrongly denied."<br/><br/>This could be you!

Children caught in the middle of all this will eventually ask their parents, “Why is this happening?” and one way or another the parents must admit to their children, “Because we broke the law and entered this country illegally.-that’s why.” I hope that becomes a valuable life lesson for everyone! Don’t skirt the system and don’t break the law- and you wouldn’t be in this mess to begin with! Actions-Consequences- Actions-Consequences how many times need I repeat it?

Not sure what planet you are living on?<br/><br/>Did you read any of the ancillary links in this article?  If you did, you might have learned a few things that would give you pause. I have known about Fiorina's story since well before she was fired from HP.  It was a long running story in the business publications back then.  One bad move after another.  The HP Family Trust that held the reigns on the board finally had enough of her visionary "song and dance" and canned her.  Rightfully so.  She was an utter disaster as a CEO.  An idiot.  A disgrace to women business leaders.  <br/><br/>The minute I read she was throwing her hat into the ring for President, I laughed out loud.  Literally!  What made me stop laughing was the notion that Republicans would actually ignore the truth about her - they seem to have a well-refined ability to do that - and actually consider electing her to the highest office in the land.  <br/><br/>She has the audacity to criticize Trump?  Either one of them would bankrupt this country within a year . . . both of their business track records prove it.

John D- and how does your comment address the constant lies of the Republicans? They rewrite history and are defended for it!! John Kennedy has been dead over 50 years!! Bill Clinton has been out of office for going on 16 years. Neither JFK or Bill Clinton is running for president but these truth impaired Republican candidates are. Try joining the rest of we progressives in the 21st century and live in the here and now. The past is gone, nothing can change it but the FUTURE of America will be adversely affected if one of these nihilistic, bombastic, simplistic saber rattlers gets control of the presidential reins.

Does anyone else think the 'make America so scary that no one will ever dare confront us again" cohort is funny? They must think that every great power didn't already try this, that it has never worked and can never work for long. When the 'mad scientist' in cartoon's would be asked his goal they would always say 'to rule the world!'. That this is Republican/neo-con strategy for our place in the world is ridiculous.

Donald Trump is telling the truth, illegal immigrant criminals are coming across out Southern Border and committing terrible crimes here against our citizens daily, anyone who does not believe that, just look at the illegal immigrants in our prison system, both State and Federal?  Look at the SCAAP Funding for your County, City and State?  Those Sanctuary Counties, Cities and States receive the most taxpayer dollars!  Our elected officials are not doing their jobs concerning illegal immigration and the more they ignore the problem, the worse it will be!  If the children of illegal immigrants have a problem with our laws, talk to their parents, they are the ones who ignored our laws and the whole family have to pay the price.  To those who talk about our immigration laws, I say to them, which laws do you want enforced?

Do you realize how little 35 billion over decades actually is for massive infrastructure projects? To put it in perspective, Reagan wasted more than 30 times that much on the failed Star Wars project, and the failed F-35 project has already gone around 5 times that over budget. It's around 1/120th of the cost of the Iraq War. It's less than twice as much as we pay each year in farm subsidies. It's only 35 times what the Kochs, two lone men, plan to spend in the 2016 campaign. <br/><br/>And that 35 billion was spread out over DECADES! Not 35 billion every year. Not 35 billion in overages. Not 35 billion on something that has failed to provide anything of substance.<br/><br/>Once you put the numbers in context, it becomes clear how underfunded Amtrak actually is. Folks like yourself want to show the numbers out of context because you are readily aware of this reality.

Several days off at a time when needed at whichever time of year can be better than one long, planned vacation: when the midday spousal encouragement telephone call—“How goes it?—gets a response of “I can’t take it anymore. . . . Let’s go somewhere, anywhere!” than “Ugh. I have so much work to do. I hate this job. I hate everybody here. You won’t believe…”

I look back, learning day by day, and I wonder and wish, why, did we get so cozy with the Saudi's?  (Other than we needed their oil, cheaply.)   I would really like to be self-sufficient and not need anyone over that way.  (Israel can move in with us!)  Let the rest of the Middle East figure it out on their own.

1000 pounds for a one way ticket to Turkey? Really? Are these girls out of their mind? Or just gullible?<br/><br/>I can fly with easyjet *tomorrow* for 80 quid from London to Izmir, next week it's only 64 pounds. <br/><br/>A bus ticket to Gaziantep will set me back between 30 and 40 pounds. That's about a hundred pounds (150$) - not one thousand! <br/><br/>A thousand pounds for a three to four hour intra European flight?! I definetly wouldn't recommend _that_ travel agency to anyone.

Should you have the right to go target shooting anywhere you like on public land? No, no more than I have the right to ride my horse anywhere I please on public land, or my brother his Harley, or anyone the right to hike willy-nilly over places such as The Wave or other controlled-access irreplaceable lands.<br/>Should parks, when practical, offer designated, safe (backstop, etc.) controlled areas where shooting is permissible (and where hiking, horseback riding, etc. are not)? Sure. But<br/>Your errant rifle shot carries a great deal more danger than if I were to ride my horse stampede-speed right over you!

Selective Mutism?! OK, it's an anxiety disorder affecting one of one hundred and forty. Deal with it...However, as a certified educator for many years, what do we call a generation under thirty who are increasingly losing their verbal and oratory abilities, while at the same time the dexterity with their thumbs has increased tenfold?! The Made in China Syndrome, Part III?! Who knew that the future would depend more on the use of our thumbs, than man's ability to carry on a verbal discussion with one another?! If that is an affliction, a greater number have it, and we must decide what we want our children, let alone ourselves to know!!!

A huge payday, huh?  This article primarily focuses on widows over 65.  What about the widow who lost her husband at 49?  With 2 children still in school? With a business to run, bills to pay and tuition for college looming on the horizon???? If you think that having your spouse die is a big payday you might as well just take a contract out on your spouse and get rich!!  I know widows who lost everything when their husbands died.  They ended up selling everything to stay afloat.  There is not always a big insurance policy.  Even if you've been married for 40+years.<br/>The thing about Death??? You can't beg, pray, cry, plead or bargain to change it.  Something most people never have considered.  No matter the situation, we can always find ways to adjust to it, change it or bargain our way out of it.  Death has no second chance.  Try living with that for a while.

Why give ISIS so much attention?  Stop the relentless coverage of this group along with Trump!  It only empowers all this nonsense.

Are you serious?<br/><br/>We have caused havoc thropuoghout the Islamic work during the past 15 years by trying to impose our values and beliefs on countries whose cultures are completely different from our own. We have destabalized a huge piece of the world by meddling and imposing democratic values where, just maybe, they simply won't work.<br/><br/>Should we try to persuade these countries to change and respect gay rights? Absolutely! But we have no  right to insist that they adopt our moral code...

"A 19th century economic theory disproven in the 20th"?  Are you referring to socialism?  Perhaps you should inform Denmark, Sweden, Norway, France, Germany (yes, eek!), etc. that socialism doesn't work.  And yes I know these countries use a combo of capitalism and socialism--kind of like FDR who clearly proved that socialist policies work in the 20th century.<br/>By the way, I hope your nanny is getting health insurance from you, that you are paying into social security for her/him, and offering paid days off, a decent salary and a little less condescension in your treatment of her/him than displayed here.<br/>Or would that be too "socialist"?

Ever notice that when everyone agrees that an event is inevitable, it often never materializes? Especially with the media and the pundit class. When everyone agrees that Republican voters will come to their senses and reject The Donald, that tells me to be skeptical. And since The Hair Apparent is far and away the most moderate (!) and most reality-based (!!) of the field, why not Trump?

What is the basis for this ignorant comment? Do you understand how education works? "Teach little?" Well, yes, if you don't understand that being qualified to teach means that you are a research leader at the cutting edge of your discipline. Yes, if you don't understand that professors actually work on-on-one with your child to give him or her personalized experience through special courses. Yes, if you don't understand the extensive service that faculty do for their university, community, and profession. Yes, if you think that getting a BS, MA, and PhD (10 years+ of specialized education) doesn't warrant job security and decent pay. Look around at national salary figures in the Chronicle of Higher Education to see how most professors are paid (as this article applies to very few schools). Go after the administration, not us. No six figure salaries around here (not even remotely close!) as a tenured professor.

How is it even possible that the voters in this country could even consider electing another Bush?  It just boggles my mind.  He's not the smarter brother, he's just the same as his brother.  He will take this country into war with Iran, he will hurt the poor, especially women, and he will continue to enrich those that are already rich.  Just google his 'shaming' of single mothers in Florida where he and his Republican legislature passed a law saying that single mothers had to publish their entire sexual history for a month in a major newspaper and they had to pay for it!  It was called the Scarlett Letter law.  And women, rightly and smartly, ignored it.  But to even TRY to do such a thing makes this man Jeb! a loser of the highest order.  May he never hold any public office - even dogcatcher - again.

387594
It must have been tough for Jeb? to deal with the Bush family dynamics. I wish he'd listened to his mother and stayed out of running for president.<br/><br/>Jeb!'s campaign reminds me of a hapless tortoise that's been rolled over onto it's back.

It's fine to call for additional spending on tuition, but what about faculty? My husband is a doctor and I'm a professor, and we see the same thing happening in both fields: budgets are slashed for faculty (in his case, nurses; in my case, tenure-track teaching positions) while administration keeps adding positions and getting bonuses for 'saving money.' Of course the money saved is saved by cutting the very service that the institution is supposed to provide, and overwhelming the necessary employees with copious amounts of paperwork (one assumes, to cover administrations butt in the case of an eventual lawsuit). There's a fine mess occurring all over the US whereby lawyers sue over every mistake (no matter how innocent), organizations hire more administration to oversee (micromanage) performance and create a paper trail to defend against imminent charges, and soon the institution that formerly provided a public service (health, education) can barely comply with its mission because of the costs of bureaucracy.  Meanwhile, the bureaucrats (usually MBAs and lawyers) feast on the carcass of the things that once made this nation great.  I guess this is what Bush meant when he said the US was becoming a 'service economy.'  Now we have universities filled with bitter adjunct professors, hospitals with overworked doctors and nurses; and soon no one will enter those professions because they don't want to deal with the copious oversight and shrinking salaries. Well done!

Where are the RICO indictments and public demonstrations?<br/>There's approximately 319 million people living in America.<br/>Based on a recent article in Forbes Magazine, most of this debt is owed by   " twenty somethings" and "thirty somethings."<br/>If (according to the latest census data) approximately 91million are between the age of 20 - 40 and 40 million of them have student loan debt, this issue is more pervasive than we have been led to believe.<br/>44% of Americans between the age of 20 and 40 have student debt.  Only 37% of them are paying on time.  Student debt has surpassed credit card debt while home ownership for Americans under 35 has plummeted.<br/>Now there is talk of a taxpayer funded bailout!<br/>Where is the outrage?<br/>Bankers, lawyers, politicians all in cahoots to take money from low and middle class people and giving it to the wealthy............<br/>Yet the sheeple hold demonstrations when ATM fees increase?<br/>What is going to take to wake up?

Why shouldn't private equity fund managers make a bundle from managing these endowments -- and also pay cut rate taxes on that income?<br/><br/>There's truly no difference between ripping off a corporate retirement fund with high fees and doing the same to a university.<br/><br/>This is, after all, an MBA world, and the best MBAs come from the best universities, which have the highest endowments!  And what makes the best MBA? -- endless greed!  So, it's natural these MBAs alumni would use their influence to get these accounts!  <br/><br/>It is, after all, what they have been taught in MBA school!<br/><br/>What if these universities closed their business schools to replace teaching greed with teaching knowledge?<br/><br/>No, the MBA's would never allow that.

Have you read "I Raised My Eyes to Say Yes?" by Ruth Sienkewicz-Mercer? She was institutionalized with CP at an early age (though her parents didn't want to) and thought to be mentally incapacitated. Toward the end of her years in a notoriously awful Massachusetts state hospital, a caring employee began working with her to invent ways for her to communicate. Eventually she left the hospital and lived in the community, got married and co-wrote this book.  She is now deceased but people in our community still remember her with awe. Communication systems for the disabled should be helping your son express himself. Keep pushing! And good luck.

"The cost of tuition at Yale is falling"?<br/><br/>Then why do they--and all other colleges--RAISE their tuition each year?  And by percentages MUCH HIGHER than the overall cost of living?<br/><br/>from: Yale Daily News (March 2, 2015)<br/>For the third year in a row, the cost of attending Yale will increase by roughly 4 percent. ... With this rise, students not on financial aid will pay $62,200 per year compared to the $59,800 undergraduate bill for the 2014–15 academic year. Tuition will rise from $45,800 to $47,600, and the cost of room and board will rise from $14,000 to $14,600.<br/><br/>And "$16,528" net?  I don't think so...<br/><br/>[Yale's own Admissions site]<br/>The total Cost of Attendance for attending Yale in 2014-2015 is $63,250, which includes tuition ($45,800), room ($7,800), board ($6,200), and books and personal expenses ($3,450).  In recent years, the average Yale Scholarship (a need-based grant) has been $41,250 for students on financial aid...<br/><br/>You don't have to be a potential Yale student to see that the numbers YOU cite are simply inaccurate! (Even if average scholarship, it's $63,250 - $41,250, or well over $20,000!)  <br/><br/>And we haven't even begun to factor in the costs of books, etc, which easily run into the $thousands!

389413
Students pay only 25% of their educational cost?  Really.?  They pay $45,000 per year for 16 hours of class time 26 weeks a year. That's 416 hours of class time.  On average they split this with 19 other students.  That amounts to $2163 per hour of class time.  That seems like an awful lot. But according to you, that is only 25% of the bill.   Are professors really making $8600 per hour of instruction?   Imagine how much they would make if they actually taught 20 hours a week for 26 weeks a year.  That would be $4.5 million per year, with 6 months of vacation!  Wow, I went into the wrong field.  Even if half of that money went to administration and overhead, the students are getting a really raw deal.  In fact, most their tuition goes to supporting non teaching activities by both administrators and faculty.  These activities have dubious value when it comes to undergraduate education, and should not be charged to students.

There are far more graduates at Purchase than Yale? Harvard? Let's see, if each graduate could donate $100 a year (generous, but not out of the question), and there are approximately 4300 students there per 4 year calendar, that would only take 930 years to raise $400,000,000. You're right Greg, how silly of me!

Where are the active campaigns against Bush &amp; Cheney for leading the US into a war that has cost the nation 1000's of lives? There aren't any worth mentioning because tacitly, the US media has given those two a pass. Why? Because nothing good can come from it. <br/><br/>On two sides of the scale here are justice and reasoning This pursuit for justice fails the reasoning smell test. India is a democracy of a 1.2 billion people with overwhelming support for Modi. If, by some chance justice prevails India will be worse off. No, this is a personal pursuit and not a noble one.  American media should understand if Modi is actually convicted the riots that will likely follow will make what happened in 2002 look like a picnic. Welcome to the real world!

What other explanation than greed and stupidity can explain a town manager insisting that his city "had acquired 'senior' water rights, putting it in the front of the line should cutbacks come"?  And the genius who says "I don't think they should hold back building at all"?  Talk about denial!<br/><br/>The lack of water in California has reached catastrophic proportions, and we have businessmen cutting up jackpots for future development.  California used to be considered progressive, but leave it to corporations to put self-interest ahead of all the other men, women and children in the state.

By their faulty plan, the more Hillary and Bernie did and do for civil rights the more their rallies should be disrupted??!!<br/><br/>That is a calculation I do not agree with. By targeting candidates and their supporters with proven civil rights records in their disruptions ostensibly about the need for more civil rights action, they are not only preaching to the entire choir and the preacher him/herself, they are also making themselves seem foolish and clueless.

 Does Donald Trump have a plan for how roughly 12 million undocumented immigrants -- and their family members -- will be identified and rounded up?  Oh wait, this effort will require an agency employing thousands so there's a boost for the economy right off the bat!  How about the cost of actually transporting them to their respective countries?  Maybe all those who voted for President Trump will chip in because they're so grateful.  His plan just might work!

and if I may clarify an important point -(if it has been overlooked?)<br/>As Akison Smale reports; 'conservative (German) lawmakers oppose more help for the heavily indebted government in Athens.<br/>Did ypu read it? - 'Conservative lawmakers' who like in the US are the Lobby of the Banks. And these 'conservative lawmakers' oppose more help not only - so they say: because Greece never will be able to reform - NO!<br/>They oppose because they also know - that there is NOTHING in this 'deal' for any German Banks or anybody in Germany - whoever.<br/><br/>It will be just the money of German Tax payers for their firends the Greeks.<br/>And yes - once upon a time European Bank and not only German but very heavily also French and Italian Banks wher involved but with the first haircut - where 100 Billion of debt were forgiven the debt was restructered to a debt with the lowest possible interest and a maturity in over 30 years. <br/><br/>And now it is the European Conservatives who don't want to help Greece anymore - just like US conservatives - who probably bever would think about helping one of their own - Puerto Rico with over 300 Billion Dollars?

Customer obsession? Let me tell you my story. <br/><br/>I had been a longtime Amazon customer, first in the US, then in the UK, when an e-mail from Amazon.co.uk arrived, addressed to  and informing  that an Amazon Marketplace buyer complained about their purchase from . I deleted the e-mail, and in a couple of months, had my Amazon.co.uk Marketplace account blocked. An angry automated e-mail branded me a fraudster, and told me that the decision was final. <br/><br/>"Common sense" must prevail, I thought, and wrote a polite letter to Amazon.co.uk's customer service. Response? A Borg'ian e-mail a month later, confirming the original decision. "Alright", I thought, "the poor Polish laborers working for Amazon.co.uk customer service are powerless, let's escalate the matter". (In Britain, too, Amazon had been in the spotlight for exploiting its (blue-collar) workers - although it is Amazon's tax avoidance that got the most attention). I went to LinkedIn, and found a customer-service executive of Amazon's European operation. A polite snail-mail letter went out to Luxembourg. The outcome? My <a href="http://Amazon.com" title="Amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> Marketplace account - linked to the contact e-mail I included in my letter - got blocked! <br/><br/>Does this sound like an efficient, customer-centric company staffed by normal people? Not to me. The snub actually cost Amazon money - if i cannot resell a book, I will order it, read it, and return it. Well, Amazon, if that's how you want it to be...

Aren't we ready to move beyond these polarizing (albeit attention-grabbing) headlines: Our Digital Lives Are Completely Marvelous / The Ruination of Humanity?!<br/>Clearly- our digital age brings both good and not-so-good into our lives and our relationships- but it's complex and it's personal. We're in new territory, without a doubt- I expect more from the NY Times than these polarizing headlines and articles that only paint half the picture.<br/>Reading through the comments there are merits on both sides of the aisle- of course people of all ages have the ability to connect in ways previously unimaginable. And it's also true as DH points out is that phones / tablets / laptops are rarely out of sight - they're the Third Man and social digital pacifier for adolescents (and beyond.)<br/>What's worrying is when our young people who have grown up with digital media don't know how to thrive without it- don't know how to flourish in relationships without it- or even to be comfortable spending time completely on their own.<br/>There's simply no comparison between long-distance keeping in touch and being in the same place at the same time with people we care about- so why keep comparing?<br/>Don't we all want to have the best of both worlds? And isn't it our responsibility as parents to ensure our children know how to nurture the inconvenient, messy, complicated relationships of 'real life' that are ultimately, what make keeping in touch across the miles of any real value?

Why should the German Citizen/worker/taxpayer continue to bail out those Southeastern European screw ups time after time after time in the name of European unity and solidarity?  Enough is enough.  The Greeks should finally grow up and get their house in order.  If was a Germany taxpayer I would be livid.  Year after year it's subsidy after subsidy, financial aid after aid, bailout after bailout, refugee aid after aid, WWII guilt trip after guilt trip galore.

Forgive my ample reservoir of ignorance, but how on earth could an exhibit entitled "Harlem on my Mind" NOT contain the works of black artists in general, let alone the retrospective representations of those who were born, lived and perhaps had even passed away there????<br/><br/>Plenty to make immediate and introspective work from I dare say:  The War, reflections of the all too recent Watts Riots in Los Angeles, remembrances of a steamy afternoon on a front stoop in a concrete canyon, uncollected detritus, happy kids and an opened fire hydrant, a mugging, a derelict in a doorway, the marquis for a concert at the Apollo, a cockroach the size of a small dog, a Bessie Smith recording of St. Louis Blues with Louis Armstrong on Coronet and Fred Longshaw on Harmonium that then and still takes ones breath away......<br/><br/>And not a black artist in the house.<br/><br/>How on earth did a group of supposedly cerebral artists themselves miss the fact that art is first and foremost personal and visceral before it can be universal?<br/><br/>Amazing!

I wonder why it is that down through the ages ignorant, insecure, and fearful men always had to control women?  Why is that?

Kill them!  Oh wait, we must keep a few, but they must be at all times, under our control.  Furthermore, all Gods must henceforth be big and burly with long, long beards.

A show of hands, please: How many reading and commenting here found high school American History fascinating?  Couldn't wait for the next day's class, devoured the entire textbook in the first week of the school year addictive?<br/><br/>Anyone?  Anyone?<br/><br/>For the rest of us, allow me to recommend a tome by James W. Loewen, "Lies My Teacher Told Me."  First published 20 years ago, this book should be required reading for all Americans.  Unfortunately, "requiring" anything makes that thing unappealing.<br/><br/>Forbidding a thing, on the other hand, makes that activity suddenly and deliciously exciting.  So, I am going to take the moral high ground here and FORBID any of you to read this book.  FORBID it, lest you suffer the inevitable: increased intelligence, deeper understanding of why we are in this mess, and disgust (if that is even possible) with the state of political discourse today.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, if all of this year's Republican presidential aspirants had read "LIes," none would be out there on their soapboxes telling them.  Which indicates to me that not a single one, especially Trump, has even heard of this book.<br/><br/>DON'T READ THIS BOOK!

"Anyone remember Jean Valjean?"<br/><br/>Oh, please now - enough!

How many are committing theft, burglary, armed robbery solely as a last resort to surviving (instead of an easy way to get a buck)?<br/><br/>And this "Relegating people to low paid and hopeless jobs" clearly exposes what's wrong with all of this revisionist cause-effect blaming that is so popular these days.  When did general society do a 180 and do away with Individual Responsibility for one's actions, and instead blame everything and everyone else for whatever consequential situation one found himself/herself in?

Anyone?<br/><br/>Once again, I think that the Times is letting it's liberal bias trump (HA!) it's common sense.  You think, I suspect, that stacking the electoral deck with poor illegals made legal will assure democratic victories.  If that is so, it is really sad.

I too support an "earned path" to citizenship, but why do we have to keep an antiquated practice alive [birthright] when it's effects are bankrupting our social systems? Birthright citizenship pre-dates our constitution, as did the medical practice of "bloodletting" and we don't do that anymore because we know it doesn't work! Rewrite the 14th amendment. Let's at least talk about it! Why not enter illegally, have a baby, yet the baby gets a temporary ID and deported back to country of origin and we bill whichever country they came from for hospital expenses. Fair and humane.  Problem solved- next!

Why not?  It's worth a try.<br/><br/>I just came out of a group meeting with two women from other cultures who's norm is eating way better than our fat-laden sugar diets.  They both have aggressive forms of cancer.  One woman, Japanese, with a long list of health credentials under her belt, did note than when she further eliminated wheat from her diet, she did get the side benefit of her psoriasis clearing help!<br/><br/>Can't hurt, might help.

What does this have to do with NOT telling women that they have the condition?  I realize that this is a small point, but I was shocked to see it in the article.  Patient education is the key, not withholding infomation!

They're not "following Trump" anywhere--they've all been saying those things for months (years?)!  <br/><br/>All these "candidates" seem to gave STARTED at the bottom, and since then, have constantly defined new depths as they make ever-more extreme right-wing statements.

"Like remoras on a shark"? Really? Could you have found a more obtuse metaphor? Whoever is responsible for this particular editorial, could you offer him or her a lesson in remedial plainspeak? And while you're at it, you might want to contemplate what proportion of a general readership is familiar with the adjective 'feckless.' Oh, to be lacking feck!

Excuse me? Schools are still highly segregated!!!!!!  And this is because hearts DID NOT CHANGE. <br/><br/>You can pass all the laws that you want to....they must be enforced. We still segregate and discriminate in housing, jobs, and schools. While it may be illegal, it happens systematically.

When attacking someone on an issue, it might help if you yourself had solutions to suggest; scilicet, Why aren't you offering X, Y, and/or Z? Confronting someone, as BLM did Hillary Clinton, and saying, "Tell me what you're going to do about this!" is less constructive when you have nothing to tender.<br/><br/>If, like Cornell West, BLM seeks revolution, then they should stop pretending to wish to work intra-systemically. If they seek sensible resolutions to their troubles, then they might think of proffering solutions. When Clinton said that "in politics, if you can't explain it and you can't sell it, it stays on the shelf," she was right, of course. What is it they want exactly?<br/><br/>By being disruptive, BLM is generating attention, which forces politicians to respond to this issue, and that in itself may be good. But I'm tired of hearing black leaders try to outdo one another in their obeisance to the "black prophetic tradition." West may want to entrust this country's destiny to a revolution, may think Obama a member of the nefarious neoliberal bourgeoisie; but I don't.<br/><br/>The notion that the only people who care about or can do anything for the oppressed black underclass are socialists is laughable. The unwillingness of those who speak on behalf of the black community to abide paternalism of any kind, to speak out against any negative behavior on the part of blacks (whatever its cause), however destructive, is doing far more harm than good.

What, my name was in that list of names in Ashley Madison?  Why, honey, you know how people are pulling jokes all the time and someone just used my name is all and just made up some information about me from the top of their head.  Just wait until I find out who did this!  Now don't be upset, honey.  I know you're mad and want to find out who would do this to me too.  Love you too.  What's for dinner?

If no DH, then what about closers who only pitch one inning and only in situations where their team has a small enough lead?  After all, they stay in the air conditioned clubhouse for most of the game regardless of what is happening outside.  Most of them couldn't pitch two back to back innings to save their lives -- and they never touch a bat unless a splintered one happens to come their way.  Rivera is going to the hall on a unanimous vote the first minute he is eligible -- you cannot argue that!

REALLY?!? Have you had to deal with a government agency lately?!? Unfortunately the experience bears out that what you call a lazy move is in fact so prevalent that not to call out would be akin to sticking your head in the sand. I live in DC and run training programs for government agencies. I can't mention a single instance where (a) everyone showed up - even though it was a mandated training session or (b) didn't take extraordinarily long breaks because as one participant told me "they can't fire me anyway." <br/><br/>And BTW if you flew more you'd probably realize that arguing with TSA about the stupidity of their rules only gets you escorted behind a closed door for even more intense screening by people who were not smart enough to catch 97% of non-approved objects (including weapons) when the IG tested them.

What issues important to the average voter has he been talking about? All I ever hear him talk about is building the wall along our southern border (making sure that Mexico pays for the wall) and poking Jeb! Neither of these things concern me one bit.

A Mexican chef in an authentic Georgian restaurant?! Well, why not, if Grigoryi Chkhartishvili is a famous Russian writer of crime novels, Boris Akunin.<br/>Georgian cuisine is wonderful. Chabostnili, Slide No. 9, should attract Melissa Clark's attention as an addendum to her article "The Great Eggplant Question: To Fry or Not to Fry?", of 7 Aug 2015.<br/>But, no Georgian wines? No saddle of lamb?

Well, guess what? Some black people are bad. Some white people are bad. All are human beings, which really is the point. Born equal, not born to have equal lives, but chances to live free and find their way without oppression or constant fear.<br/><br/>Whites can start by acknowledging we are racist by definition, so we can keep moving forward towards unlearning it and helping others to unlearn it. No one learns racism except from their own families and friends. Period. Tough to accept, but the way to start. Let it end with our own generation.<br/><br/>One start at the local level: Look around at your community's schools. Are they equally maintained? Do the children in all the schools get the same quality books in the right numbers? At some point we have to just try harder to get past the blaming of both whites and blacks and fix how things work. Why is one school better than another? Who on your school board is okay with terrible discrepancies among school facilities, etc.?<br/><br/>So sad to just keep badmouthing when as allies we could effect real change. That is the real work. Decades of poverty and ignorance don't give us very good citizens, so stop blaming the black poor neighborhoods for nurturing criminals and kids escaping into drug use or dealing. What are their options from an early age?!

Liberals are better educated and more thoughtful than Republicans  (but then who isn't?).   This fact gives liberals the illusion that they are always right.  After all, their principal opponents are typically Republicans and we all know how dysfunctional that party is.<br/><br/>But that means that on those occasions when the Republicans ARE right, there is no rational argument offered in favor of their view.  Republicans are not capable of rational argument (or when capable, too cautious to actually offer one).  And liberals will obviously not offer an argument against their own position.  So our dialogue is impoverished.<br/><br/>For instance it is irrational to be blasé about 54 million (or more) abortions and be horrified by the execution of a murderer.  But Greenhouse, who is clearly an intelligent person, is capable of taking such a position.   <br/><br/>Cuba actually has a stricter abortion law than the US, and Mexico has stricter immigration laws than what the US practices.   Republicans  have not noticed this!  Follow "furriners"?   NO!! <br/><br/>Similarly, all Trump had to say about illegal immigration is that we ought to enforce our own laws.  But being Trump, he had to combine it with insults to Hispanics,  most of whom are in fact not committing  rape or murder.<br/><br/>There is not much hope of rationality until we have a better Republican party.  Some conservative positions have merit, but Republicans are incapable of offering good arguments and liberals don't WANT to.

Actually, Ms Weiner why the surprise?  This is Washington D.C. we are talking about. The surprise would be to find someone smart and not cheat! D.C. is ground zero for stupidity and cheating. That the small fries were exposed is no big deal. But the large fries are the dangerous ones who can make or break us while indulging themselves with decadence and frivolity, all with a big chunk of our hard-earned money. Remember a ( a 4 or 5 or whatever star! ) Gen. Petraeus? Oh, but D.C. is not short on sanctimony! Hypocrisy rules!! Philandering and stupidity are the rule, not the exception.

Why isn't there a stricter licensing procedure to all the street performers in Times Square? They prey on the tourists and make the whole T. S. commercial  and tacky and not the NY that all of us love. Regulations from the City should be enforced and people can enjoy the plazas in PEACE!!!

Really???? I'm a New Yorker for 40 years and I won't go near Times Square. I know many other resident New Yorkers who won't either. Times Square was once a beautiful place. Now it's Disneyland on acid. If you want a Disneyland in NYC, then build one! Don't bring back the hustlers from 8th Ave. and the old Meat-Packing District. This is not a public square-it is one big mess. Never did I think I'd  be with Bratton on anything, but I'm with him  on this one.

 Everyone thinks that this dentist named Walter Palmer is a bad guy for killing the beautiful creature everyone knows and loves named Cecil, but what about the rest of the animals? Everyone is making a big commotion when there are other animals being killed right now! What about those animals? Extinct or not, all animals should be treated fairly.<br/> Everyone thinks that Walter Palmer should be hanged or should go to hell and those people saying these remarks may be meat eaters. There is no difference from killing them and eating them. There are certain animals in this world that we can eat and some that we cannot eat. The ones that we cannot eat shouldn't be harmed for any reason. These people who love to hunt and see animals die seem a little crazy to me. These hunters like to chop off the animals head and hang them on their wall as a trophy. I do not see any sanity in that! If these people love the thrill of shooting guns they should just go to a shooting range. As a man of God, I believe he put certain animals in this world for us to eat and live off of. Those animals are to keep us from starving and for us to live healthy.<br/> Other animals are there for us to enjoy and those animals make this world more beautiful. These animals should not be hunted. I am for one who thinks hunting should be illegal. These creatures deserve to live just as much as we do. So if everyone is going to go crazy over the lion named Cecil, it should be this way for any other animal.

How do you really know about what you're claiming? Were you around during The 1930s and World War II? During the latter the tax code DID more or less level the playing field, even though some of our own plutocrats would have gladly been in Hitler's pocket and would have turned the USA into Vichy France.<br/>Do your homework and read history. Read our Constitution and its Amendments.<br/>Read 20th-century American history. I not only lived through a good deal of it, I also studied it in public school.<br/>The contrast it with what had happened after 2000 (actually, three years before with studying the postings of the Project for the New American Century--"PNAC"--a cabal including Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Jeb! from its beginnings and which gave us 9/11 as the condition precedent for ultimately invading Iraq. And now they propose to do it again. And their Congressional allies have eschewed collegial practice and doing what's best for the country and demonizing the reasonable Mr. Obama mostly for his race.<br/>What would YOU do--fix things here or become something like Zimbabwe?

398542
Over and over (why am I surprised?) history repeats itself in these comments. As if one person is all that is needed to change America! A POTUS has some power in foreign policy; in domestic policy s/he has a bully pulpit and a veto pen. (See how Obama has been savaged in Congress and in the Courts?) As for the bully pulpit, try Fox as an opponent, Fox that engages in war, no holds barred, no lie too big, no Geneva Conventions. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but even that would be better than irrational exuberance.

You don't know what I'm saying?  I'm assuming you came of age in the 60s/70s from your last post.  I'm saying someone from an era that rallied around mantras like "Turn on, tune in, drop out" (Timothy Leary in San Francisco - 1967) has little business throwing stones.  YOU used to be on the receiving end of charges of laziness from your elders, too.  Surely you can remember that?  You were also called "cowards" during the Vietnam War protests.  Were those labels true?  Of course not!  Furthermore, "Millenials" aren't the ones making national policy.  We're no more responsible for Iraq, then you are for Vietnam.  Do you think right wing GOP candidates' are banking on winning support from my generation?  Nope, YOURS is their bread and butter.  We ARE the ones, however, making the most noise about human rights, global warming, income inequality, gay rights, and a host of other issues.  So what I'm saying, I guess, is that you might see us fighting our own battles in our own ways if you would just look a little closer.  You'll have to come down off of your pedestal to do that, though.

I quit (retired from?) my law job only a few weeks ago.  I made the decision after a "last straw" - more unjustified nastiness and disrespect from the firm's powers that be.  I have been a lawyer for over 30 years, and it allowed me to support/raised my children - that's really the only good thing I can say about it.  Like you, I now need to figure out my next steps.  In the meantime, I am finding that I am sleeping at night a whole lot better!

If you're such an 'open-minded' feminist, then why can't these women express themselves the way they want? Why must they have to wear clothing? If Gloria Steinem et al., chose to wear clothing, then good for them! <br/><br/>As an 'open-minded feminist,' you should support the right of all women to choose! <br/><br/>Your children shouldn't be so uncomfortable with seeing naked bodies, anyway.

You can't drive anywhere in the suburbs during the summer without seeing a shirtless, fat dude with moobs mowing his lawn and THAT'S legal but a woman with painted breasts? The horrors! If panhandlers are harassing people, they should be stopped but enough with the decency police telling women to hide their bodies without applying the same rules to men.

Why are you running a biased opinion piece as an objective front-page article?<br/><br/>That's not good journalism and is beneath the status of The New York Times as, supposedly, the "paper of record."<br/><br/>Jason Horowitz's screed should be on the opinion page, if at all. Shame on you!

Why does this sound like a television commercial for cheap furniture? Buy now!  Low rates!  Make no payments for...  <br/><br/>The "FEDERAL GOVERNMENT" can borrow at historically low interest rates and that of course means those rates will never - ever go up because those rates are guaranteed by something super stable.  I mean if the government is going to this lender with hands extended....and it's not like the interest rate will shoot up someday.  No, that would never, ever, happen.  It's a good deal so we should take it.  Just like buying cheap furniture on easy terms is a good deal.

"Radical left"? "Marxist"? <br/><br/>Only in America. LOL <br/><br/>The US has gone so freakin far right, it sees anything else as the New Red Scare. Utterly ridiculous. <br/><br/>Bernie is no such thing. In the UK, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other industrialized countries, he’s considered a run-of-the-mill Democratic Socialist - a solid centrist.<br/><br/>If he’s “radical left” and “Marxist”, then so was America’s beloved FDR!<br/><br/>Horowitz flinging around false labels is 100% lazy and biased, whether deliberate or not. Such misinformation and ignorance is inexcusable. <br/><br/>As a journalist with the largest newspaper in the US, Horowitz has the perfect platform to educate the public as to the true politics of Bernie Sanders - Democratic Socialism, NOT “communism”. Continuing to attach these prejudicial, inflammatory labels to a genuine liberal progressive (remember old-school Dems like FDR?), maligning a true statesman of the people (not billionaires) borders on defamatory. <br/><br/>Bernie Sanders is our 21st century FDR.

"Can Our Transit System Get Any Worse?"<br/><br/>Why, of course it can.  Put it in the hands of Republicans and you'll see how much worse.  Or you can achieve the same sorry result by handing it over to a market-drunk Democrat fearful a Republican will brow-beat him or her over public spending.  <br/><br/>Way to go, Boomers!  (And your parents.)  Eat your seed corn.  It's good.  And future generations are going to spit on your graves.

Ask yourself, why is corp america so afraid of Sanders that they have started a campaign of silence in the media against him?<br/><br/>A vote for hilary is a vote for the way things have been.  Aim for the center?  It sounds so republican.  Keep things the way they are right?  You probably have a bit of money and dont like Socialism huh?  Get over it.<br/><br/>It's coming.  Even if Sanders loses it's still coming.  <br/><br/>It's time for something new.  Lets stop the wealth serving paradigm of our government.  A vote for Hilary is a vote for wall street and whoever paid for her campaign.  Get real man!!!

399810
Marxist?? Wow, you really missed the whole point. Sanders is not suggesting that the working class (proletariat) should own everything (the means of production). He speaking what MANY of us have been thinking for years - that workers are tired of getting screwed. We work harder and hugely increase our productivity - and what happens to the additional profit created by the new levels of productivity? Golden parachutes, CEOs that earn 350 or 400 times what the average worker earns (instead of 50 times like 30 years ago) and the corporate attitude that "oh, since you can now do more, we don't need so of you little people ... you're FIRED!"<br/><br/>We don't want equality of outcomes - we want equality of opportunity! Who else is even talking about this seriously, as the main thrust of their campaign? NO ONE.<br/><br/>And as for whether the agenda he articulates can be implemented, that depends on ALL OF US, the electorate. THAT is what grass roots organization is all about.

Confiscated from the private sector?<br/><br/>You mean the private sector would have built the interstate road system.  Airports?  Railroads without a VERY lagre infusion of public lands?<br/><br/>Really?  Pure fiction!  It does not happen that way at all.

Why no discussion of intravenous vitamin C in cancer treatment?  Even places like Memorial Sloan Kettering now offer that therapy, though in conjunction with chemo.<br/><br/>Note also that the ketogenic diet starves cancer cells of the glucose they thrive on.<br/><br/>We know that remission of cancer can happen with treatment; sometimes without treatment.  Surely the appropriate goal of treatment should be to trigger remission in any way possible, rather than going first for surgeries which, even when minor, can have unexpected, painful consequences.<br/><br/>Maybe the instinct to say "get it out of me!" is wrong.  Maybe we should all be striving to "make it disappear" by altering body chemistry.

Aim for the Center?<br/><br/>MY GOD! We've been doing that fo decades! And look what we have!<br/><br/>THE CENTER GIVES US a country run by oligarchs and plutarch's, giant problems ranging from global climate change to poverty and the hollowing out of the middle class in America. From the lack of meaningful energy policies to world overpopulation. From the strain on ecological carrying capacity to unregulated capitalism. From unsustainable resource exploitation to economic stratification of societies into elites and the masses and certainly the outdated and irrational philosophy of constant growth in a finite world. To name a few.<br/><br/>Aim for the center?

400272
Has the US economy not by now absorbed all involuntary unemployment during which same time the fiscal deficit has been shrinking?  We are at full employment or really close to it.<br/>How is this compatible with the Keynesian view?<br/><br/>Keynes argued that the inducement to invest can't get around effective aggregate demand which must come from the state.  The capital controversy yielded the consensus that falling interest rates do not monotonously translate into progressively higher investments because of Wicksell Effects.<br/><br/>So both the absence of aggregate capital re-switching and capital reversing in the presence of zero lower bound interest rates and the reaching of full employment argue for the neo-classical model and against the Keynesian model of real adjustments during this crisis.  <br/><br/>Keynesians have no reason whatsoever to celebrate here.  If anything, Bernanke and Blinder correctly predicted in 1988 that there is monotonous relationship between rates and stock market investments and that those investments stimulate private demand through the wealth effect.  No state spending needed!

Why don't the powers that be talk about one of the BIGGEST causes of climate change: meat production? The UN concluded it is a massive contributor. Watch Cowspiracy if you want the real story because so-called environmental groups won't address it. But, the media needs to address meat production's role in climate change: the destruction of the rainforest for cattle grazing, the methane the billions of cows and pigs produce and the inefficient use of soy, grain and water to feed 9-billion farm animals raised for food the US every year! Stop ignoring the big elephant in the room!

This recipe doesn't quite make sense as written--really, who can crisp the chickpeas in such a short time?  Why add 1/4 cup of sherry if you're just going to evaporate it?

And so easy that it's become a week-night staple in my house.

Does a white trans college professor have more or less privilege than a non-trans female college professor?  Does an unemployed male white minimum wage worker have more privilege than a black female corporate executive?  Obviously, these are absurd questions!  Using the lens of relative privilege obscures the real problem in our society.  That being, the privilege of the ultra wealthy to run it as their personal playground.  As long as we keep pointing our fingers at each other, we have zero chance of making our's a truly humane society.

$67 a month? For Cable TV?  Does that figure include the taxes, fees, and costs to rent a cable box for every set you want to use? Before I cut the cord, I even had to pay each month for the REMOTE to, you know, operate the cable box I was paying for!<br/><br/>These extra charges are never mentioned in the promotional advertising for these predatory companies.  I suppose they figure consumers will just swallow them once they're committed to getting the service, but the fees typically drive the total costs north of $100/month, particularly if you have several TV's in the house.<br/><br/>It can feel very difficult to cut the cord, making you feel like you're cutting yourself off from an important cultural link with the world.  But $100+/month is a LOT of coin you could spend on something else, and between the Internet, free over-the-air TV, and a local sports bar, you really have everything covered.  I don't miss it at all.

"It's about time"?!!<br/>What a breathtaking glossing over of the destruction of the resources of tens (hundreds?) of millions of us who have no control over this madness and no hope of making gains for our future with simple savings. Get a grip on reality, Mr. Percentage of the One Percent.

So it's the "creative class" (self-defined) that "gives a city vitality"?  How arrogant!  The rest of us "drones," who merely create the jobs and pay the taxes that make the existence of the "creative class" possible, won't miss them when they're gone.<br/>Don't worry about us.  The city will be just as vital.   Just cleaner.

"Where’s the moral spine in America and in the world today? Because how are we raising our daughters, our sons? Where are we looking for the guidance of how we’re supposed to live?

Sang-froid?!?   How French.  Never thought I would see that has a description for members of the American military.  But, for all our cultural differences, the French and Americans have never been warring enemies.  Perhaps, this action on the part of my compatriots, along with Frances's help during the Revolution, the many alliances between our countries through the centuries and the lovely gift of the Statue of Liberty, we can see our way to a better friendship.

Am I the only one who suspects that the 'military personnel' described here might actually be US intelligence operatives who were tracking this individual, rather than two Marines who happened to be taking high speed rail across Europe?

"In Ages?"<br/><br/>  Does 39 years count as in ages, because Jimmy Carter's primary constituency was also "the people."  There's some poetic symmetry in that as one populist leaves  -- having done everything he could -- another emerges.<br/>  They are different men in different times, but both are fierce patriots driven by a love of this country and what it should be.<br/>  Or is your reference to FDR in 1932?  As I recall, and my memory isn't what it use to be, Franklin announced at the 1936 convention:<br/> (Delivered in a resounding voice) <br/><br/>"Let it be said of my first term that the forces of greed met their match. And let it be said of my second term, that the forces of greed met their MASTER!"<br/><br/>Wowzers. Listen to it on You Tube.<br/><br/>(Of course a president can't talk that way unless they receive a landslide.)

"If treatment does not make a difference, should women even be told they have the condition?"<br/><br/>A doctor's function is to diagnose and discuss his/her findings with the patient. The doctor's further function is to give the best medical advice he/she knows how to give and perhaps treat the patient if treatment is decided upon BY THE PATIENT. It is decidedly NOT the doctor's function to MAKE the medical decisions as far as treating or not treating goes, but rather to give the patient the best information so the PATIENT can decide what he/she wants to do.<br/>Withholding a diagnosis from a patient in my view is malpractice (at least). If a doctor did that to me I'd have him up before the state medical board in a heartbeat.<br/>After getting ALL the information he can its the PATIENT who calls the shots as far as being treated or not. Not the doctor. The patient may make the wrong decision, and the doctor can emphatically point that out to the patient. The doctor can also refuse to continue with the case if his advice is not taken..but no information is to be withheld from the patient. Its not the doctor's decision in the end to treat or not treat. That decision belongs to the patient and the patient only!!

THE BUSINESS CYCLE  Whatever happened to its being a natural part of the free market?  If the marketplace does truly work upon the evolutionary principle of survival of the fittest, then the passing of less successful species of economic endeavors will make way for more successful species to succeed.  But to take that position is viewed by many so-called "free marketeers" to forsake their beloved ideology for the fundamentalist belief that virtue will carry the day.  No doubt, some of the corporations that lose will have been conducted scrupulously and, will have earned their just rewards in the world to come.  But, alas, Wall Street is not the Temple of Capitalism, nor the captains of industry the High Priesthood.  Like it or not, the stock market is a secular institution.  So, at least where finance is concerned, the separation between church and state is absolute.  Except, of course, for those true believers who, with their magical thinking, engage in risky practices, treating the resources of stockholders as their private gambling parlor.  But stealing from others is forbidden both in secular and religious law.  Bringing us back to the fact that there is nothing sacred about the free market, which is equally free to fail as it is to prosper.  That's closer to life in the jungle.  But there you have it!

403269
What did Obama do before he was president? What were his qualifications?? Trump has created a successful business that has hired 1000s of employees. Sounds like he know how to get things done. He isn't just talking, there is clear and persuasive evidence! Legal Hispanics for Trump! 

403820
You mean about specific, particular women? I'm sure most women think that about certain other women on a daily basis. Men think it towards other men. Men towards other women. Women towards other men. What's your point? Oh, you mean to accuse the man of saying ALL women are these things, so as to demonize him and anything he says.  You only have your disingenuous, politically correct view of the world view to thank for his popularity. Congrats and keep at it!

403848
"You guys"? You mean us annoying gay people? How dare we disturb your equilibrium by confronting institutionalized homophobia with the simple act of coming out. Tom Brady flaunts his heterosexuality every chance he gets. Now this brave young man can appear in public with his partner too. Bravo, David!

And you think Trump can change that?! That's how uneducated the electorate (Republicans and Democrats) is about how things actually work.  

404010
"High road to electoral victory"?  That's 2-2 in the LOSE column!  There is nothing "high road" about this freak that's called Donald Trump and as to "electoral victory", he might be polling high with the Republican loonies that are so short-sighted they can't see their hand in front of their faces but in a general election (and when the polls are asking ALL registered voters about their support for Trump) his numbers TANK. As to "tearing the wall down", didn't TRUMP himself say he was going to "put a wall up"?  That's 3-3 you got wrong, bud. 

404166
What "mass immigration"?<br/><br/>That peaked about 6 years ago at just over 13 million illegal immigrants. Since then, the number has declined to just over 10 million. In fact, were our borders more open, the number would likely be even lower, as millions of mostly Mexicans used to regularly cross into the U.S. for six to nine months of agricultural work every year, then return home. Then we started sealing up the border, so now they remain here once they make it across.<br/><br/>And of course, numerous studies (even one conducted by the Comptroller-General of the State of Texas) have all concluded that illegals actually contribute billions more to our economy than we pay out in programs that help them.<br/><br/>But then Trump's popularity, heck, NO Republican's support today, is actually built around any facts or sense of reality! So why should these things matter?

404254
War on Women? Heck, no, there's no War on Women! Just that you aren't ending a pregnancy for any reason in Anti-Choice America, so just know you're pretty much just an incubator. Your feelings, beliefs, previous experience - it's worth nothing in the face of the War on Women!<br/><br/>Wise up, women who still vote Republican: the men in your party don't seem to think you're fully human.

404271
Good news?<br/>For criminals maybe.... and people who get their feelings hurt by old flags and heros like Catlyn Jenner. Good Lord man! The U.S. is a crisis and the POTUS takes a vacation, sorry, but that does not look good in the publics eyes, nor does dealing with radical government leaders.

I thought I'd jump in before some of the "fact police" do, to point out that "Et tu?" literally means, "And thou?" But idiomatically, "YOU TOO?" is pretty close.<br/><br/>Enjoyable puzzle. Nice gimmick, side-by-side anagrams. (Oops! Should I have given a SPOILER ALERT?)<br/><br/>I spent so much energy writing on the acrostic blog I'm all out of juice. But before I wimp out, let's have an often-performed ARIA in Italian:<br/>"Vesti la giubba" from I Pagliacci (Leoncavallo)<br/>Franco Corelli<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/E_UUS7DqVUQ" title="https://youtu.be/E_UUS7DqVUQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/E_UUS7DqVUQ</a>

Maybe it is the cutting of funds to education? Maybe it is a society that turns away from a culture of learning to a culture of "fun"?? You cannot blame this on uneducated immigrants.  They certainly weren't talked about as a problem for the past 20 years, since they seemed to absorb the jobs that didn't pay enough to keep them in the working/middle class. I do agree with you though about the exporting of jobs.. and this seems to re-enforce my point about too-low wages.<br/><br/>Also…the MAJORITY of homegrown terrorism is committed by white citizens. This should be obvious.  <br/><br/>But think about Trump sitting across the table from a leader from ANY civilized country… do you think his style of negotiating will be productive and/or well-received??  I don't think so.  We may be in decline, but we are STILL the best country around!!

405284
A 'small subset of divers'?? Are you serious? This guy is the greatest diver of ALL TIME! He won gold medals in 2 Olympic games and it would've been 3 if we hadn't boycotted the 1980 Olympics. He should've had a Wheaties box back then. He's one of Americas greatest athletes. I don't understand what you mean when you say we shouldn't 'dwell on a presumed sin'. And if people don't remember him they should. Watch Back on Board on HBO...

Probably the most useless, corrupt and anti-freedom organization in the world now would somehow be better served if we changed the sex of its' already worthless Secretary General?<br/>Do you editors actually believe the nonsense that you promote?<br/>The UN should be dismantled. It no longer serves a legitimate purpose. It is overrun by police-state dictators and their spokesman. It no longer promotes freedom or human rights or anything that actually makes sense.<br/>It does seek to destroy the west with insane "environmental" restrictions that will only serve to impoverish all of us.<br/>It is anti-Jew. It is anti-west. It is anti-freedom and it is pro totalitarianism.<br/>And it has outlived and forgotten it's purpose.<br/>Do away with it.<br/>And do away with the editorial board of the NY Times. IF a journalist wants to express an opinion-do it -and sign your own name to it, rather than hide behind the "editorial board " logo!

WON'T FOLD?  Of course not--Trump will TRUMPET!  He bloviates a trickle down brand of politics that is intended to reach the lowest possible common denominator.  As if any were needed, he's dumbing down politics in the US.  So what's not bought and paid for by the 1% wealthy extremist wignuts is diverted to the windbags and empty heads who follow Trump.  On one TV interview, one woman, asked why she supports Trump said,  Well with all those billions of dollars he must know something!  Yes.  However, with all those piles of money, is he offering anything of value to thinking people?  His brand of politics takes us back to dark times before WW II in Germany, where a monster with a big mouth shouted his insanity and poisoned the land, creating horrors heretofore never imagined in the world.  Make no mistake--Trump would use every resource at his disposition to flatten the opposition. In fact, one of the most horrific ideas I can imagine would be a Nukyuler Trump in the Oral Office with his finger on the button.  Having destroyed political discourse in the US, he would proceed to reduce the Earth to ashes, proclaiming all the while, I'm Donald Trump!  I always win!

You have Masters degrees and you can't see that Trump has narcissistic personality disorder? He is a misogynist that collects Trophy wives as objects. He treats every group like they are a disposable object. His policy positions are fantasies that can't be enacted in reality. He's alienated every group in the country except for angry, victim complexed whites. Everything Trump says and does is about promoting Trump. Everything from the big bold "Trump" painted on his helicopters and airplanes to his toxic rhetoric is about Trump and not about Americans. Trump is a reality TV star like Josh Duggar and Honey Boo Boo and if they were running, the same people would vote for them! Lastly, Trump has filed for bankruptcy 4 times and has had dozens of failed real estate deals. The Wizard of Oz is not what he appears to be. On top of all this Trump doesnt have a single day of government experience and neither has he served in the military a single day. So having Masters degrees means nothing because anyone can get a degree in this country and still lack discernment and be a poor judge of character.

Lack of fight? How obtuse! President Obama has fought tooth and nail every day he has spent in office. Attacked visciously and relentlessly by the warmonger Republicants, Obama single handedly corrected the Republican created Great Recession. In the months before Obama took office in 2008, the unemployment rate was 9.2% and the economy was losing 800,000 jobs per month. People were losing their homes, The stock market and indeed markets all around the world were crashing. After 7 years of Obama the economy is fully recovered and unemployment is now<br/> 5.2  %. Millions now have health insurance. The stock market has been experiencing the longest and greatest expansion in history. The 2 useless oil wars are now ended. Deficits are much lower. The strongest environmental protections in history have been enacted. No fight? What planet you live on?

Is the job of a UN secretary general desirable? When Norwegian Trygve Lie came to New York in 1946, expectations were low. The UN's founders saw the task as purely bureaucratic, to be performed by someone who would run the place smoothly. This changed when Dag Hammarskjold, Lie's successor, led the organisation amid tensions in the 1950s and early 1960s. He raised the Soviet Union's hackles and Khrushchev wanted to see him remove. He died during a mission in Sambia in 1961. Today he is  remembered as the one who played a crucial role in the development of peacekeeping.<br/>His successors had mostly been used as a "punchbag" from time to time by the member states. Most of all, a secretary general should never fall out with the US. The most prominent victim was the Egyptian, Boutros Boutros Ghali, who, in 1996, was effectively removed from his post after falling out with the Americans over a range of issues. Kofi Annan opposed the 2003 US invasion in Iraq and called it illegal. Annan still regrets the many flaws and shortcomings within the UN. John R. Bolton didn't make life easy for him. Nevertheless the late Richard Holbrooke said that Annan was the best secretary general  in the UN history.<br/>A sincere candidate needs to have much idealism! Unfortunately in the world of political realism, there is no place for such a contender. A female candidate with dignity, may not be willing to go low and ingratiate herself with world powers! And if she does, she will only face vitriol.

Should a transgender man then be told to go the women's locker room then? Bearded, muscular fellas standing side by side with your wives. All just because how you feel creeped out is the only thing that matters.<br/><br/>I know maybe transgender people should have their own gyms. Separate but equal. You say, "Oh. How dare you. Typical PC outrage. You didn't listen to what I said. You ignored me!' <br/><br/>That's true. That last point was unfair and was not what you said. But...maybe you should hear we transgender people and how we feel and what our lives are like before dismissing us and saying we're being ridiculous.<br/><br/>I'll be wildly generous and say you've spent an entire day - 24 hours - wondering and imagining how a transgender person thinks and feels. Now contrast that with decades of our informed experience of how we actually think and feel. Wouldn't you be upset if someone told you to express yourself and identify differently than how it comes naturally to self-express and identify.<br/><br/>"How dare you! You don't know me. You don't know what I think. I'm not a bigot!"<br/><br/>"Then don't tell me I'm delusional and lying. Because you don't know me. And you CLEARLY don't know what I think and feel."

The Ohio legislators in this case, are men?/religious 'God Fearing' men/women, obviously.  Welcome back to pre 1973 prior to Roe vs Wade.  Women have the right to their own bodies, especially if they know the rest of their lives will be full of struggle and pain for parent and child.  Down Syndrome children can be very happy, but they live short lives and can be very ostracised.  I would encourage women there to get to another state for safe medical care supporting their choice.  Or yes, generously fund the women and their children for the rest of their lives !!  This is the US, not a third world country !

Wouldn't it have been great if the NYT and the rest of the 4th Estate, had actually done their job, and examined Barack Obama's life and statements as closely as they have Donald Trump's?? Instead of fawning all over him?<br/><br/>Wow! We wouldn't have such incompetence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Has anyone considered the emotional state of the doctor who sang La Cucaracha? The intense bone-crushing stress of seeing what you thought would be an uncomplicated delivery turn into a life-threatening obstetric hemorrhage? The thoughts flashing through your mind about how he accurately told the family an hour ago the risks of complications were low, and now how he might have to do an emergency hysterectomy and forever deny this woman the chance of carrying another baby. And, yes, he will be thinking about law suits, too. Maybe he shouldn't have let the medical student deliver this patient.<br/><br/>Does anyone consider that maybe this resident, after meeting Ms. Lopez, was quietly reminded of a song he heard long ago, La Cucaracha? And that, after the potential catastrophe was averted, he let down his barriers and this silent song, which had been playing in his mind, came forth in his joy? (No death! No hysterectomy! No lawsuits!)<br/><br/>The interpretation that this song was meant to mock this Latina patient is an interpretation of the observers. It may have been something quite more innocent.<br/><br/>We continually complain about how our doctors show all-too-human-shortcomings, and why couldn't they be professional automatons? And yet, when doctors act professionally, the complaint is that they lack warmth and feeling, that they are too much like automatons.<br/><br/>And, always, why are doctors paid so much?

If folks like Donald Trump because he doesn't need money (because he's rich) then what about Bernie Sanders?  He isn't rich and also refuses money from the corporations.  Unlike Trump, who relies on "personality," Bernie stands for somethings and those things are what this country needs!

Where is the brown color from the three tablespoons of soy sauce?!  Mine turned out darker than medium brown.  In the video, if MC is adding more than a tablespoon of soy sauce I'd be amazed, and frankly the pale result looks as if she added none.  Her dish is white white white.

What did I learn about financial aid in my (several times) of going to college both as a dependent and independent student?  If there is some kind of barrier to completing it, or if there are extraordinary circumstances one can go to the financial aid office and request the proper paperwork and write a letter for an exception.  Been there, done that, and was successful.  Was it fun?  Nope.  Was it time consuming and at times frustrating?  Yep. But was it worth it?  Yep.  And it taught me life skills!

Your heart breaks?  What self-serving crocodile tears!  Don't forget the Gazans Voted in Hamas which then sent more than 3,000 rockets into Israel.  Israel responded, as any responsible country would, by responding forcefully.  And where did all that cement, rebar, and other construction material go?  Not to building homes and factories, but rather to building tunnels into Israel so that Hamas could try to fulfill its vow to wipe out Israel

408485
Gee, a bad deal just because Iran got everything they wanted and the US got nothing?? What could possibly be wrong with that? This deal all but insures an attack by Israel, possibly with Saudi and Jordanian and Turkish support. Obama is FORCING the world into another world war!!!

Can the market go even lower?  Absolutely!  However, for LONG TERM investors starting to look for great companies at discounted stock prices, they will be well rewarded down the road.  Oh and the sun will still rise in the east tomorrow.

Has anyone else had it up to here with Bernie Sanders' supporters being described as fueled by anger (as in this column, or as "disaffected" over the weekend)?  We liberals are actually hopeful!  How about with the analogies between Sanders and Trump?  Other than popularity, the comparisons aren't there.  Sanders is a sitting Senator, Trump is a media personality.  Sanders is constructive in his plans and is proud to have never run a negative ad.  Trump taps into peoples' worst instincts and offers illogical, half-baked plans like charging Mexico for a super-wall.  Sanders seeks to level the playing field, while Trump is so entitled, he does not even see how over-privileged he is.  This kind of coverage does, however, make me admire England, with a limited campaign season.   

408821
President Obama "oversold" his Iran deal?    YA THINK??!!!<br/><br/>Next to Carter's feckless accommodation to the Ayatollah Khomeini and the birth of the global jihadi movement, this event will go down as one of the most harmful and consequential capitulations in modern world history.

The man's left hand remained inside his patient while her performed his amusing victory song and dance.<br/>I'm glad that wasn't my mother or me on the receiving end of this display of "warmth and feeling."

So essentially after 15 years Iran can get to where it is right now? This is an argument against the deal?By that time Israel can go from 200 nukes to 500 nukes. This is a bad deal for Israel? I'm must be missing something!

@Miss Ley:<br/>You worry needlessly about "who are we listening to on the internet? Big Brother? Angels?, terrorists or demons?". And then you propose "that people are being manipulated". You don't think we know how to use freedom of speech? <br/><br/>And pray tell, what does this have to do with Trump? The short and simple answer to your internet statement is: everyone, all humanity, people of all sorts and types comminicate on internet. They are NOT being manipulated. Those who flock to Trump listened, read, and decided that a lot of what he says they agree with. You call that manipulation?<br/><br/>Please give people enough credit to be able to make up their own minds. Those you see in the picture of his Alabama rally are as intelligent and thoughtful and caring as the NYT readers. And both groups have the same proportions of the clueless, who can't understand how anyone could possibly disagree with them!!

q: How many passengers who've "forgotten" and left their loaded handguns in their carry-on luggage are wrestled to the floor by three cops and arrested?<br/>a: Not very many.<br/><br/>Cops have learned to yell the phrase "Stop resisting!" whether the alleged offender is resisting or not - it gives cops the opportunity to ratchet up their unnecessary use of force and offers them a fair amount of cover when they do.

Legislators really want to write a bill to help us all out? Repeal the slave-wage allowed for waiters.  In my state it is $2.45 per hour...<br/><br/>Restaurant employees should be just that: employees--trained and supervised by the managers, not the customers; paid minimum wage or better depending on the restaurant; covered by worker's comp, social security, paying their fair share of state and federal taxes.<br/><br/>Will restaurant costs go up?--you bet--to pay the fair wage the employees will demand. <br/><br/>Owners will need to declare all THEIR income too, and pay their fair share of state and federal taxes.  But then YOU do not have to tip at the end.  <br/><br/>You KNOW your waitperson is getting a fair wage; you have a problem, you talk to the manager, as in any retail establishment.   Get a few restaurant managers out on the floor, actually managing!<br/><br/>Tipping is so very archaic, and for a supposedly democratic (notice the small 'd') nation, a strangely American fixation, better suited to a king's court, full of petty patronage.  Very demeaning, very classist.  <br/><br/>Personally I go by: "treat and talk to the person serving you the food in the same way you treat/talk to the persons you are eating the food with..." <br/><br/> With dignity, courtesy, and rational expectations.  <br/><br/>And they should be treating/talking to you the same way, otherwise speak with their manager...<br/><br/>I'm with the bible on this - the servant is worthy of his/her hire.<br/><br/>We really need to progress from the 17th century to the 21st.

Hasn't Hamas reaped what it sowed? The Israeli military actions were not unprovoked. A Hamas spokesman in Turkey confirmed that Hamas funded and contracted for the murders of three Israeli seminary students in the West Bank. When Israelis conducted searches for the killers, who were isolated and killed in turn, Hamas followed up with indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilian communities. In response, the I.D.F. targeted rocket launchers, which were embedded in Gaza civilian communities, rather than based on open ground.<br/><br/>As the aggressor, Hamas may define its own "Rules Of Engagement," but when those same "R.O.E." are turned against Hamas targets, Hamas has no right to complain. There is an old Marine Corps adage about "Payback" which cannot be repeated in its entirety in a family newspaper, but in essence, "what goes around, comes around!"<br/><br/>Hamas has since reiterated the objectives stated in its Covenant, ensuring future wars and the I.D.F. again "mowing the grass." Article 13 of the Hamas Covenant unequivocally rejects all forms of non-violent conflict resolution in favor of perpetual war against Israel. Read it at: <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp" title="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp" target="_blank">http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp</a><br/><br/>After three futile wars of aggression,  the price that Hamas must pay in terms of death and devastation in Gaza is obvious, yet, they are willing to pay it. In the coming decades Gaza will gradually be reduced to rubble, as Hamas prefers it happen that way!

oh gosh here we go - you do realize living in NYC is so much more expensive than China? A "living wage" here is almost preposterous! No tipping is better for everyone, but you will see menu prices go up - you have just got used to letting poor people make your food and you don't even realize it. Things have to change in the restaurant business, they just do.

Why keep overlooking the 800 lb gorilla in the trading rooms?<br/><br/>Markets run on confidence!  Nobody has any real confidence in the underlying health of our markets, or how well or honestly they're run and regulated.  So ANYTHING causes a mini-tsunami...<br/><br/>Some financial types my profess chutzpa, but more honest analysts and unbiased experts (John Bogle, John Reid, etc) will tell you there are deep, systemic problems in our markets and banking that were never addresses after 2008.  We all know that.<br/><br/>We're paying the price for a refusal to address systemic problems, decades of deregulation, and unpublished criminality from markets, rating agencies, traders, and big banks.<br/><br/>Nobody has any confidence int he systems or their integrity!  We're all investing in markets since interest rates are 0, but we're all going so waiting for the next trauma...

Maybe if we behaved better in the world community by not starting voluntary wars and blindly supporting Israel on its adventures, Iran may not feel as threatened?!! Fifteen years gives us plenty of time to show a more civil America.

How did you come to this conclusion? The government never made a recommendation about water intake! <br/><br/>I quote: "Many people believe that the source of this myth was a 1945 Food and Nutrition Board recommendation that said people need about 2.5 liters of water a day. But they ignored the sentence that followed closely behind. It read, “Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.”"<br/><br/>The rest of what you say doesn't follow because your premise is incorrect. It's also "cutting off your nose despite your face" -- not a good way to react to governmental nutritional guidelines -- which are just that, guidelines.

Has the author of this article ever heard of a discipline called 'philosophy'? It has been 'teaching ignorance' and studying the limits of human knowledge since at least Xenophanes and continues today to teach students how to question the 'know-it-all' attitude of both popular opinion and much modern science. And philosophy has always, or at least for the more than 2,000 years between Socrates and Gadamer, taught that the question is more important than the answer. So we do not need some new discipline called 'agnotology' (good grief!!) and to think we do itself shows the greatest ignorance of our intellectual history.

Still trying to breathe life into that "reform conservative" thing? Or to make it a thing by repeatedly claiming that it is? Sympathies. <br/><br/>You've chosen to spend your time in the same party as a bunch of people who hate - well, a whole lot of people. I can see it's a struggle, so give it up! I think you need a new party; or, to take on the tough but needed challenge of bringing your hateful confreres back into humanity.

and how about the ubiquitous tip jar?  my pizzeria has one.  the frozen yogurt place --where it's all self serve!  What am I putting money in the tip jar for?  the kid taking my money for my small yogurt?  nope.  I don't tip any where that a tip jar is sitting on the counter.  first of all, it's extortion; and secondly, they're making more than the "required" minimum as allowed by state law for tipped as opposed to salaried or hourly workers.

So now it's the job of government and the tax payer to raise the children of parents?!  Maybe we should turn the US into a communist (everyone is the same) commune (everyone does something for others) and take away the babies when the are born.  We can put them into government facilities where they can be brainwashed to not only distrust police, but their parents.  <br/><br/>PS It is not the job of the police to run athletic programs, just as it's not the job of our soldiers to be peace keepers.  It doesn't work.  Police, like the rest of us, can volunteer to run athletic programs.  It's worked for a century, why not now?

"Have you missed the regular stories about lousy service in many countries outside the US?" ??<br/><br/>Sorry, your point about bad service outside 'the good ole USA' is simply inaccurate and your 'explanation' (last of tips) is similarly wide of the mark.<br/><br/>I've had both good and bad service in various foreign cities and many US ones (inc. NYC, and SF, where service was generally very nice, I have to say).  Without a doubt, the service I've had in Europe (and Canada) is generally better, friendlier (in a genuine, not fake way),  and usually more professional.<br/><br/>And tipping has absolutely nothing to do with it!<br/>People in Europe routinely tip slightly, and servers are *very* appreciative of that--way more so than in the US, overall, where servers expect big tips.<br/><br/>All that said, a lot of Americans traveling abroad simply assume they should be able to order in English, get exactly the same thing they get in the USA, and often are rude, loud and obnoxious about it!  <br/><br/>Maybe *THAT* is the reason that some people get bad service?

And what if the food and service are both bad? Now I have the restaurant sticking me with a 20% "Administrative Fee"? For :"Administering" bad food &amp; Service?<br/><br/>This is just the owners doing a Cop-out of their responsibility to pay decent wages to their staff.<br/><br/>Build all pricing into the price of the food and drinks. DO NOT Stick us with a "20% Administrative fee" at the end! <br/><br/>If I cannot afford a $9 coffee or a $20 glass of Table wine, I'll go to Dunkin and get a bottle and go home!<br/><br/>And have a rating system for the food and waiter - Those who are good will see their employment continue while the rest will be told to move on! [Hey, it works for big corporations where performance is rewarded - simply by keeping you on the Job. Why can't it apply to waitstaff?]

Math anxiety?  Well sure, hot understanding basic math would certainly make you feel anxious. So would not knowing how to read.<br/><br/>Read the article again.  The core (pun intended) problem is that all these folks are anxious because they are math ignorant. <br/><br/>Floundering around in front of your child (i.e. faking it) sends one message: "Math is so difficult even my heretofore infallible parents can't do it."<br/><br/>Even if a parent can calculate like a pro, there is still an excellent chance  that they have no idea how to teach their child.  My dad was an engineer and a meth wizard - also the worst math teacher on the planet.  I have seen kids in my classroom who were ruined (as far as math goes) by impatient and pedagogically clueless parents. It's not a matter of just saying "invert and multiply".<br/><br/>It is also well known that many, if not most, grade school teachers neither understand nor enjoy math. (By "understand" I do not mean the ability to simply do basic math; there is much more to it than that!)   To schools' credit they are beginning to employ math specialists for the early grades.<br/><br/>The vast majority of kids with math anxiety became that way due to incompetent instruction.  Let's focus on the real problem.

And those clever Senators and Congressmen and state legislatures that approved the 14th Amendment somehow didn't notice that the clerks had made a huge transcription error, and had by mistake substituted "and under the jurisdiction thereof" for "not subject to any foreign power"? Silly Senators! <br/><br/>When laws, and especially Constitutional amendments are drafted, the words matter. The Congress and the States chose to pass an Amendment that says "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." It would be foolish to assume they didn't see the words and think about what they meant.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean there's no room for interpretation: but the interpretation must _rely_ on the words, not substitute some other words that some person or other happened to believe better conveyed what the actual words meant, or should have been. Spin is as old as law and politics, after all.<br/><br/>Prof. Eastman doesn't get to substitute "owing allegiance" for "jurisdiction", since jurisdiction is a fundamental legal term whose meaning in the common law and Roman law has been quite stable for a very long time.

If we don't confer citizenship to children born to diplomats, because they are not "under the jurisdiction" of our government--- meaning,  they are the citizens of other countries, then what's the logic of conferring citizenship on the children born to illegal immigrants?  THey too are "under the jurisdiction " of a foreign government.  Let's pass a law ending birthright citizenship. (like nearly all other countries)   Open border advocates will immediately challenge its constitutionality.  Good.  And then the Supreme Court can clarify the matter for us, once and for all.  Let's get it cleared up!

Would US Congress/Senate be ready to uniformly apply this recommended change to any person coming from any country in the world?  The whole argument is predicated towards a community that maybe able to trace their descendants to Native American population and also to parts of US (Texas, California, New Mexico, etc.).  Other than Native Americans who can be by &amp; large considered the original descendants of this nation - everyone else is a immigrant.  So why not make this retroactive and just as companies make people reapply for their job, all reapply for their citizenship and based on your merit you remain, else good luck!

Change my investments? No way! They're allocated well, and I'm sticking to my plan. But YES, I will do something in response to this -- I've been meaning to convert a traditional IRA that I had from a former employer's 401K plan to a Roth. Now seems like a good time to do that because the tax hit will lower. I've been waiting for this to happen because the market was inflated, and I didn't want to do that in an inflated market. And I may put some more money in the stock market now, too.

When will the public face the fact, that most dietary recommendations are based on hot air? It isn't, that newer studies change recommendations, the recommendations never were based on real science from the start!<br/>As to water, this "simple substance", it makes all physiological functions possible. The regulation of  electrolyte  (aka salts)  and water content in tissue is crucial to sustaining life and therefore subject to complex regulatory feedback mechanisms. There can never be a set amount of water intake, since so many variables affect its  use in the body.<br/>Whenever a nutritionist or doctor tells you to eat or drink specific amounts of anything, you can be sure that you deal with a quack.

But wasn't the economy of America back to a healthy state by 1937, after banks went bust in 1929? That seems short and sharp!! The economy of 2015 is still suffering from 2007!! <br/><br/>If failing banks are like tumours, that simply refuse to die but can't sustain themselves without extra blood supply (angiogenesis), one would be wise to deny it to them.

David,<br/>Did she tell her doctors that she was aware of what they were saying?  Most ocular surgeries are done with topical anesthetic (eye drops) if less than 20-30 minutes long.<br/>If more time is needed, the doctor OR anesthetist gives a pain medication and/or sedative IV which gives a “twilight sleep” that does NOT put the patient out--similar to the meds given IV for colonoscopies etc.<br/><br/>Patients need to tell their doctors of such concerns.  If surgeons or MDs are doing 10-20 surgeries a day it’s easy for them to slip into more relaxed behavior without 100% concentration.  Did their “lunch” conversation result in a less than best outcome?  That’s hard to say.  HOWEVER she really needed to tell them that she was less than pleased (to say the least!) and she was upset with their demeanor.<br/><br/>Patients always seem reticent to complain about any problem with an MD.  Fear? Am I being too aggressive?  You don’t have to be angry but patients SHOULD tell their doctors about anything that seems out of the ordinary.  Surgeons have removed the wrong kidney or amputated the wrong limb before.<br/><br/>Nothing will change in medicine unless we get feedback.  We are far from perfect.<br/><br/>40 yrs ago after being awake for 72 hrs I cared for a child with a simple fracture of the leg.  It was 3 am.  I showed the x-ray to the mom, then put on the cast while talking with the mom and child.  I put the cast on the wrong leg!  I apologized profusely I said “Why didn’t you say anything?” <br/><br/>“Maybe a new method?”

"Every other country on earth manages without birthright citizenship"  -- really?  The few of which I am aware all have citizenship a a birthright. Can you give me 3 substantiated examples where this is not the case?  If your claim were true, the world would be teeming with people that have no citizenship at all.  And lets say you adopt this revocation of birthright in the US:  to where exactly would you then deport this countryless newborn?  Talk about patent absurdity!

Development? Until they enrich past 20% they are within legal limits. Saying that Israel isn't bound to any conditions regarding their nukes because they haven't signed the NPT would mean that if Iran unsigned the treaty you would have no basis to demand they not acquire 100 nukes. Now that does sounds fair, we agree! I surmise one reason Iran has to place some of their nuclear capabilities inside mountains is because some countries disregard the sovereignty of others, international law, and openly violate the UN charter by bombing the nuclear facilities of those they suspect of acquiring the exact same type of weapon they posses themselves. Israel has done this twice. Iran may also be suspicious of letting certain inspectors into all of their facilities because the inspectors could illegally record the exact GPS location of anything in the building for future bombing. The US did this in Iraq in the 90's. I'm no Iran lover but both friends and enemies must be held to the same standard of law and judgement. I'd love to continue the debate with you my friend.

DOESN'T EVERYBODY REALIZE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ACHIEVED “PEACE IN OUR TIME?”<br/><br/>But only for the next ten years and then he has agreed that Iran can have as many nuclear weapons as it wants in accordance with this agreement!<br/><br/>Iran does not have intercontinental ballistic missile delivery systems, but they can afford to rent a van for a suicide bomber instead!<br/><br/>This treaty is a great diplomatic victory for the Obama Administration!<br/><br/>The USA, France, Germany, England, China and Russia did all get together and then all agreed in essence to "Give away everything Iran wants in return for a ten year pause before Iran is allowed to have nuclear weapons with the capability to destroy the USA and Europe!"<br/><br/>The US agrees to release Iran from Iran’s treaty obligations under the existing non-nuclear-proliferation treaty that Iran previously signed!<br/><br/>The US agrees to lift trade sanctions against Iran that were implemented against Iran for Iran’s capture of the US embassy in Iran and Iran's failure to comply with Iran’s obligations that Iran agreed to comply with as a part of the previous non-nuclear-proliferation agreement that Iran signed! <br/><br/>This will give Iran the economic capability to arm and finance many more religious fanatics around the world. <br/><br/>How will the USA ever deal with a bunch of nuclear armed religious fanatics?<br/><br/>The US agrees to allow Iran to have Nuclear Weapons ten years after this treaty is agreed and ratified by all of the governmental parties to this agreement!

Maybe Europe needs to do what the US does? Just pretend all these people don't exist. Let them do all manner of cash in hand work but give them no rights.  The US has some say 11 million aliens, refugees, migrants or whatever you call them living and working all around you. Europe doesn't need to grow a spine it just needs to copy the US denial system!!

@American girl:  You ask why we are not given a voice now?  I ask why we were not given a voice back when these plazas were created in the first place!  Bloomberg decided we'd have plazas, and so there they are.<br/><br/>As for cleaning up Times Square, that credit goes to Giuliani.  Times Square can be (relatively) clean &amp; safe, but plazas are not necessary for that, as was proven between when Giuliani was mayor and when Bloomberg foisted all these plazas on us.

We put in our 45yrs of dirty, sweaty, apple pie eat'n. beer drinking hard liv'n and just want to retire with some dignity.<br/>Quit moving the finish line farther out of reach and making the prize smaller still.<br/>Raise the SS. cap and lower the age.<br/> Give the American worker some hope.

What did Carter do wrong in conservative eyes?<br/><br/>He failed to "wag the dog" as did Reagan when he invaded the military super-power of Grenada a mere TWO days after suicide bombers killed almost 300 US and French military and diplomatic personnel in Beirut.<br/><br/>He failed to save the Iranian theocracy of Ayatollah Khomeini by selling it arms in its moment of need.<br/><br/>He failed to help Saddam Hussein use weapons of mass destruction against his own people and his neighbors. <br/><br/>He failed to support bloodthirsty Latin American dictators and their death squads. <br/><br/>He failed to balloon the federal budget deficit by running up a credit card bill to pay for tax cuts on the rich. <br/><br/>He failed to turn a blind eye towards Latin American drug cartels allied with right-wing dictators.  <br/><br/>He failed to support the apartheid South African regime in the face of world opposition. <br/><br/>He failed to illegally send arms to Central American terrorists allied with Latin American military dictators.<br/><br/>He failed to rant against "welfare queens" while showering the top 1% and CEOs with welfare. <br/><br/>What a terrible record!

414090
"Given these lasting achievements, why is the Carter presidency viewed with such disdain by so many?"<br/>Because we have become a war-like nation where any move towards peace is viewed as weakness. With a military the size of the US's - thats not defense THAT's offense! Look at congress they're all chomping at the bit to go to war. Who cares whether we win or lose - there's money to be made and comparatively its not our citizens that die in such great number. All we seemed to learn from Viet-Nam was to abolish the draft.         

414092
And, has everyone noticed that these good things came about during a Democratic administration? Read your history, folks. Republicans only talk about cutting budgets and lowering deficits when they are NOT in the White House. When they lead the U.S., they spend huge amounts, take money from Social Security to wage profitable wars, and "forget" to include the costs of their war in the Federal budget. Intelligent young people need to pay less attention to what politicians say and watch closely what these politicians actually do. Then, vote out those who lie to you and do a better job yourselves .Go to law school; run for office. Do not wait passively for bad things to happen; change your future by your own actions. Your country needs you!

Not to get personal, but have you filled on in recently?  I have all the information and three degrees, two technical in nature, and enough math background to fill a small landfill.  The FAFSA is a PITA, not because we're not capable but because a large part of it is nonsensical and for a student with -- and let me make this clear -- zero access to my financial situation-- got that, zero, nada, zippo, my kids don't see my paychecks -- filling in sections without my assistance is impossible.   It is a parent form masquerading as a student form for the vast bulk of high school to college graduates.   And that is the largest problem... And the login procedure borders on the absurd.  I dare say every single parent logs in as their student, in violation of the agreements you just clicked that said, don't do this!  Please, don't conflate learning ability with anything to do with the FAFSA and/or CSS.

When will it all blow up? You'd think that fifty years, most of them spent at war, would have long since destroyed a Ponzi game. Like, the people who ran this game on the American people have long since died. They didn't live anywhere near long enough to benefit from the game. What are your thoughts on their reason for setting up a game that they would never derive any benefit from? Did they do it just because they could, the Republican P-arty of the day being too weak to keep Roosevelt and his cohorts from doing this to the American people?<br/><br/>"I know I will never see any money from Social Security."<br/><br/>Gee, Tony! That's so sad! I'm seeing money from Social Security, so I guess that I've been really lucky to have gotten old when I did. You should have done what I did and gotten born before WWII began.

Why does it always have to be about race?  Serena is an amazing athlete but she is big, muscular and simply not considered as attractive as others in the traditional feminine sense.  But it is not because she's black!  As someone had mentioned, if she looked like Beyonce, it would be a different story.  If she looked like Alicia Keys, it would be a different story, etc.<br/>Why did Chris Evert get more endorsements than Martina Navratilova?  It was not an issue of race, she was simply better looking.<br/>Are we a superficial bunch, yes.  But let's not go overboard, it is not always about race.

A gentleman commenting here asks 'But then why do they hate everything Obama does?' Because they hate Obama! The second the Democratic party nominated an African American for the POTUS in 2008, I am guessing the Republican party rejoiced, thinking that they had already won the white House. Then reality hits a few months later and they have not been able to accept that ever since and will never accept that!

Meredith and all,<br/><br/>When Meredith writes "Carter’s point leads us to the Basic Question ---who runs things in the world's most famous democracy? Private wealth, or govt elected to work for the majority?" I take issue with this statement. A good Govt. does not just work for the majority or a rich minority, it works for the best good of ALL the people! <br/><br/>One of the great faults that many found with Mr. Jimmy was that he never veered from that. He accorded all the same respect as citizens.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Jimmy,<br/>Peace

There is a huge unfilled gap of people wanting you to work for them for free? Well color me shocked! <br/><br/>The thing I truly despise about law schools the most is that they are full of comfortable law professors telling you not to "sell out" and to work for the needy etc....while those same law schools are raising tuition well above and beyond inflation every year.<br/><br/>The law schools are the big problem. They make it impossible for people to work in pro bono and public interest. You need to live and pay your loans.

The same Mead who supported invading Iraq in 2003 over continued sanctions? Is that who we turn to for wisdom in your view? The essence of your nonsense is that we need to engage in war with Iran quickly before it becomes too hard. That's the same logic the Pentagon used when recommending nuclear war with the Soviet Union before they caught up with us. Sure we'd take some hits, but we'd obliterate them! <br/><br/>By your illogic, allowing Iran to have nukes is good, but preventing it unleashes a nuclear arms race! Is this Cheney/Bush strategery? <br/><br/>Your history is also flawed, but I suspect you have no capacity for self-correction. Weave your false narratives and believe them all the way to Armageddon.

"It’s probably safer to ask “What do I admire?” than “What do I want?”<br/><br/>These days it appears that a plurality of Republican voters admire Donald Trump more than any of the other "rational" choices available because he's expressing the irrational Id of Republican ideology.<br/><br/>David will, of course, shortly treat us to a soft endorsement for John Kasich, as the Mitch Richmond of 2012 -- Jeb! having shown that the only thing he has going for him is the "rationality" of a lot of money from a few people who think they can buy a future administration cheaply.<br/><br/>So the wit and wisdom of homily Tuesday will soon revert to partisan form with David.<br/><br/>"Oh, I was talking about life choices, not political choices, which, of course, have no effect on your life, especially if you're, for example, Sheldon Adelson looking to have the DOJ look the other way on your shady casino operations in Macau, the Walton Family looking to repeal the 'death tax," or perhaps the Koch Brothers making sure that climate change advocates get lobbied down."

Ok, so then if Yellen and Bernanke really thought more stimulus would, and would have been, better, as it looks very likely is the case, what is/was stopping them from pushing for it and getting it? How does this work? What power do they have and not have de facto, not just de juro? What do they need to fear in possible future political/institutional backlash, and exactly how much and exactly why? <br/><br/>Can someone very clearly and directly and intelligently explain this in a public article for the first time ever?<br/><br/>I mean Yellen has a Board of Governors 100% appointed by Democratic Presidents! What is she and Fischer afraid of? That Republicans might get mad and take away the Fed's independence once they have the Presidency? First, Republicans don't need much provocation to do crazy profoundly harmful things once they have the power to do so. Second, when they have the Presidency they will want lots of monetary stimulus then, to keep power, the way so much of the public thinks the President is a King and so a bad economy is always his fault, as is a good one. And third, by pushing bad, or sub-optimal, Fed policy you're biasing towards a Republican being elected President anyway.<br/><br/>So, someone, if you can, please write an article saying what our last two Fed chairpeople have been so afraid of, in not pushing for what it looks like they really think/thought is optimal policy! I mean WTH!

Black excellence, white excellence, why must it be one or the other?  Serena is an amazing, graceful, powerful athlete who deserves every win - she trains hard enough for it! As a white woman, I see Serena as a athlete who loves what she does and does it tremendously well.  I also see a woman who has matured over the years, learned to laugh at herself and the crowds, learned to respect and appreciate her peers, learned to navigate the prickly world of reporters and press.  I do not always cheer for Serena to win - sometimes I want the other player.  Not because I am racist or un-American, but because I might just like the other player better that day.  That never takes away from the respect and admiration I have for Ms. Williams.  I cannot wait to watch her light up this year's Open!

Why cite the London School of Marketing's most marketable sports stars study as if there is a rhyme or reason to it?  Consider the other inequities on the list -- at #5, Kevin Durant with zero NBA titles; at #4, Lebron with two titles; and way back at #11, Kobe with 5 titles and SEVENTEEN all star game appearances!  I don't doubt the art and science behind the London School of Marketing's list -- it just shows that success in terms of titles does not necessarily equate to marketing power.  Oh, and the fastest man in the world, with the coolest name in the world, Usain Bolt, is #14, five places behind Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a cricket player.

I was thinking the other day about DFW writing about Federer for the NYT, and daydreaming, "In my wildest imagination, who would I like to see write about the greatness, the brilliance, the beauty, the swagger, the strategy, the finesse, the fist-pumping, the EXCELLENCE of that all time great, Serena Williams? Claudia Rankine, obviously. Nah, will never happen. Too good to come true."<br/><br/>Imagine my face when I saw this headline and byline. THANK YOU Claudia Rankine, thank you Serena Williams, and thank you New York Times!

Why aren't they traveling to other Islamic countries, who can afford to take them in?  Egypt, UAI, Saudi Arabia, etc., etc.  Europe doesn't want them!  And, given previous experience with people from those regions, I don't blame them.  They certainly have given no good reason why Europe should accept them.  I support closing the borders.

So what do we do about it? I married one to whom I largely lost six years of my life. The shock of discovering the comprehensiveness of his lies absolutely blew me away. Then I was with another, a kinder gentler version, for eight years. My father was one. ... Am I just unlucky or somehow primed for this? I'm sure it doesn't reflect well on me that these are the people I've fallen for and spent so much of my life with. ... I really, really would like to find a partner who's a good person: present, able to acknowledge his faults as well as strengths. For now, I'm not dating!

Interesting in what way? Like a horror movie kind of interesting?<br/><br/>Because, I don't know about you, but I personally don't let my 3 year old near the stove and Donald Trump's maturity, impulse control and language skills (ie "you are stupid!") are on par with my kid, no offense to said child. If you would find it "interesting" to let this overgrown, mama's boy, bufoon near the "button" then we share VASTLY different ideas of what makes anything "interesting."<br/><br/>As a lawyer, I am sure you have heard of the Constitution? Yeah, there is this whole "and equality for all" pesky kind of mandate that someone like our President is supposed to uphold. Trump is a man with one consistent message: he hates anyone who is not white, male or angry so does it not worry you that he may not be able to execute that tenet properly?<br/><br/>Relative to finances, Trump has declared bankruptcy many times. So again, not to overuse the word "nightmare" but I wouldn't let him do my checking account let alone our countries'. Not sure what would scare me more: 1) that he lies 2) the he cheats and 3) the he is not good with money. I would prefer my tween to him.<br/><br/>Trump is a joke. An expensive and embarrassing joke, but one that exists nontheless. He has no game. His vocabulary is Fred Flinstone sized, "STUPID! DISGUSTING! WA WA UNFAIR", his intellect is limited and his morals are on the floor.<br/><br/>...and yes, that makes me gnash my teeth and it should yours as well.

I will never forget my favorite college English teacher, the first day of class, asking us, "What's the purpose of literature?"  We gave him a whole bunch of grandiloquent answers.  "No! No! No!..." he said. "The purpose of literature is enjoyment.  And what I hope to do is to teach you how to better enjoy it.  That's all."  On the other hand, this comment by Leslie Jamison reminds me of Thomas More wearing a hair shirt:  "When we read a book that requires that effort — when the act of reading becomes rigorous and self-aware, rather than effortless and transparent — we get to have a history with what we’ve given ourselves to, a history etched into us by the demanding friction of its difficulty."

When I saw the lineup before yesterday's game, I was like, Wright in the cleanup spot? The guy's hit nothing but singles down in A-ball. What is Terry Collins thinking?<br/><br/>Well, all it took was one swing to prove me wrong. What a game! What a comeback! You couldn't write it any better than this... at least, not since the Great Flores Saga of late July.<br/><br/>And now, who would'a thunk it, the Mets lineup is starting to look downright scary. Down the stretch, we could have:<br/><br/>1. Granderson<br/>2. Murphy<br/>3. Wright<br/>4. Cespedes<br/>5. Duda<br/>6. Flores<br/>7. D'Arnaud<br/>8. Lagares/Conforto<br/><br/>And capable vets like Uribe, Johnson, and Cuddyer off the bench. Combined with our rotation of superheroes, this is a team that could go DEEP into October.<br/><br/>I can hardly believe this is happening. It's been a long time since it felt this good to be a Mets fan!

"Ban daytime sprinklers" -- that's what you are calling water conservation??? Bwahahahahahahahaha!  Let me tell you what conservation is in California -- you can only water your lawn twice a week and only at night, no car washing, no washing of sidewalks or decks, and if you comply with those measures and still go over your water usage allotment, be ready for steep fines to the tune of doubling or quadrupling your water bill.  I've had neighbors who have been tagged with $2500 monthly water bills.  That'll make you think twice about real conservation.  Seems to me that Waukesha should try some real conservation before they raid the Great Lakes.  Can you imagine if Californians proposed to take just a little bit of water from Lake Tahoe?  C'mon Waukesha.

To DR,<br/>Why don't you believe I'm a Democrat?  There's such a thing as a centrist Dem!  Not every Dem is a liberal Dem!  I guess I should change my registration to Independent since the Dem police don't find me liberal enough?<br/><br/>In any event, with regard to your points.<br/><br/>Trump clothes made in China: Ok, you got with that one.<br/><br/>ACA:  Do you really think our monthly med payments wouldn't be a tad lower if Obama had gotten a little tougher with the "medical /pharma" complex?  He came into office with a huge approval rating and then didn't use the bully pulpit to get something better!<br/><br/>401K:  We are now seeing the end result of Obama's reappointment of that no-nothing Bernanke.  Years of zero-interest $$ for bankers and hedge funds to recklessly invest in high-yield debt in both the developed countries &amp; emerging markets.  Now the bubble is bursting.  Check your 401K.  What they're now mainly blaming on the China debt bomb bursting is just the start of the worldwhile debt bubble.<br/><br/>Home values:  Yep, they went up.  And they're going to go right back down again when the debt bubble bursts.  <br/><br/>P.S.  Who was whispering in the ears of the Fed &amp; Treasury all through the Bush &amp; Obama admins?   Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Blackrock, hedge funds, etc.   At least Trump knows how the markets really work, poor Bush &amp; Obama had no clue &amp; got snookered by the Wall Street "experts".  Dodd-Frank's not going to save the banks when this gargantuan bubble bursts!

No "In the Unlikely Event"?!?!  I loved that and The Marriage of Opposites by Alice Hoffman - historical fiction and a big departure from her previous works.<br/><br/>Is that Annie Barrows of Ivy and Bean and The Magic Half fame?  Is this her first adult work?

Oh, my goodness, is that a hint of respect for Bernie Sanders and his supporters?  Even my under-30 daughter sent him a check.  <br/><br/>$10, $25, $50 -- it all adds up.  We are the people PAC.  That's what democracy looks like!

I've said it before, and I'll say it again (and I'm sure I'll continue saying it again and again and again and again): twenty children were gunned down in Sandy Hook, and one half of the voting populace in this country (including their representatives) collectively shrugged their shoulders, and said, "Who cares? Our guns are more important than your lives."<br/><br/>If twenty children can get massacred, and a large group of voters simply don't care about that fact, then this is what we'll be stuck with.<br/><br/>Yay, freedumb!

Hypocrisy? You wanna talk hypocrisy!<br/><br/>If conservatives made statements that were half as vile as the liberal comments listed on this thread, trashing Trump and Christians, you can rest assured that the Time's censors would instantly delete them.

Really?  We're now to take advice from this disgraced former politician on how things should be run?  Spare us all!<br/><br/>Secondly, this laughable line: "The mayor is an ideologue, in the best sense of the word."  Actually, it's quite the opposite, a man of very limited leadership way in over his head and beholden not just to certain backers (not unique, admittedly) and so vainglorious and hubristic that he is more concerned about his public image and imagined political future that he can't stay in the city for long before he's on the road again touting his supposed achievements as if it's all done and the city is running in tip top shape.  <br/><br/>Seriously, Editorial Board, you can do better than this dreck.

Geet<br/>An out of wedlock child? How Sarah Palin-ish! Her daughter was pregnant and single when Sarah was running for v.p. If they didn't mind it in the present - and in fact identified with it - they shouldn't mind it in the remote past.

Why would the NYT Editorial Board provide Jeb Bush with guidance on how to win an election to be President of the United States? He is one of the principal architects in the destruction of the education system of the USA. Do you really want him as President, and there is a better than even chance he will win anyway!

420103
Maybe we should focus on something other than the third-world gun violence going on every day in this country?!? Yes, more puppies on TV. That's the answer.

What I can't understand is why someone doesn't call Trump the name he deserves? He's a liar. And all within a few sentences of each other. He asked for the gentleman from the International Press to be forced out of the room by his gorillas. Then he accused the man of "screaming" at him which the man clearly did not do. In fact, he was very soft spoken. Then Trump went on to say that it was Security, the very people that Trump asked to take the man out, of taking him out on their on! And people applaud him? Where are our morals, not to mention ethics. Yes, as Bruni said in today's paper, he's another McCarthy. Just what this country needs in an era of such deep political divisions.

420569
How many gun-wielding men will have to kill unsuspecting Americans before we stop this insanity?  Living in such a sick country is getting to be incredibly disheartening.  Where is my and my fellow Americans' right to live peaceably?  <br/><br/>Our Constitution begins, 'We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'  Our nation is not perfect, not just, has NO Tranquility, and general welfare is spat upon in large measure by those who demand our nation is Christian.'  Are these the 'Blessings of Liberty?!'  <br/><br/>Our nation, as it currently is, is diseased and morally bankrupt.

420682
If Friedman, the NY Times editorial board, the Times stable of mass immigration propaganda writers, and our few percent business owner nobility are such lovers of "pluralism" why don't they brain wash us readers 24/7 with appeals for an upper marginal tax rate of 90% on all income over 100K - to pay the actual costs of flooding our nation with 10's of millions of unskilled immigrants?  Why don't they eliminate all zoning codes so they have low income housing next door, and their kids have to walk a gauntlet of ethnic gangs that want to steal their lunch money, phones and sneakers?  Why don't our lovers of pluralism outlaw private and religious schools so their pampered children have to really 'share' in the Balkanized "pluralism", of imported hatreds, racism, disrespect for women and tribalism that working and middle class "natives" have to experience by  sitting in classrooms dumbed down 2 grade levels - because most of the other kids have illiterate immigrant parents?  But no!  Just like with military service, where only the poor white, brown and black trash are expected to die and live with blown off limbs due to our 1% greed and incompetence ... its the working and middle classes, those too "uppity"demand a living wage, lazy natives who are expected to suffer all the injures and collateral damage of our elites' manic reckless "global economic integration" crusades.

420687
How can you suggest spending more?!  The US, including the inner cities, spends more per child than any country on the planet.  It isn't the lack of money.  The problem lies in the parent or parents that have a child (or multiple) that they cannot afford.  That's true for most of us when we are young - so we save to buy a house in a 'good' neighborhood.  Then we have kids and raise them to be responsible, learn in school, and when they disrupt class or don't do their homework, it's the parent that must instill discipline.

420695
Want to fix our schools? Get the illegals out (start fining the employers and they will self-deport). Then, you get the government out of education as much as possible. You then force schools to compete against each other for the money (e.g. allow families to choose where to send their kids and each dollar associated with that student). The NEA must be destroyed.<br/><br/>Read the Underground History of American Education. Our system was designed to create mindless drones like cogs in a machine. Enough is enough!

420901
How do we fix this? I don't vote Republican and cannot vote against those from other states who support gun ownership and are in bed with the NRA. My senators and representative in Congress are all for strict gun regulations. How do I change the minds of those who don't represent me and that I don't have redress with? I will NOT take the blame for this. It is up to those who vote the NRA apologists into office to do something about this. Sadly the rest of us don't have a voice!

421029
And what, pray tell, has Trump proposed to do about campaign financing? I've not heard a single word from him (or from any other Republican candidate, for that matter) about that very important subject! And I don't expect to any time soon.

421072
What can you say? This is so tragic and unnecessary. Another angry man with a gun and a grievance acting out violently, this time on live TV. <br/><br/>I can't help but feel that an entitled, victimology mindset, wherein angry, disgruntled people (mostly men), blame everyone but themselves for all their problems, contributed to this tragedy. Personal responsibility would require accepting at least a portion of the blame for one's own situation in life, and that just won't do. No, much easier to put the onus on innocent people and external circumstances they perceive as beyond their control. <br/><br/>A desperate need for attention also seems to be at play here. In our, "Everyone look at me!" media and online culture, being infamous is just as good as being famous. Apparently, this guy filmed his crime and posted it on YouTube and Twitter. Like the snuff videos ISIS produces, he knew our morbid fascination would compel us to look at what he'd done, and was proud of. <br/><br/>Again, what can you say?  We live in a victim, grievance mongering, narcissistic society, with a lot of sick people nursing a  long list of grievances, who want their big moment in the spotlight, and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it.<br/><br/>I won't even go into the gun control debate, because, I mean really, what's the point? If twenty plus dead second graders didn't do it...nothing will.

421158
"Questions like, is his child really from his first marriage like campaign literature has stated? Bernie was not a quiet person in his twenties and his quotes will be in print and on ads making him look less serious than we know he is."<br/><br/>No one cares about the kid, and if you have to go back to his youth to find something wrong, that says volumes about what kind of candidate he is. who didn't do regrettable things in their youth?!

421260
Desperate evangelists found a new idol to worship in Donald Trump?! So illogical, blind, and hypocritical. Maybe evangelicals have a brand new version of the Bible. Or, maybe Trump is so ingenious that he is exposing the empty-headedness and vanity of religiosity and Christian theology singlehandedly "in your face" way. Christian evangelicals will cling onto anything even when they know so well the "God" figure is so anti-Christian and ungodly, and blatantly violates all the principles. Maybe Trump is the Anti-Christ. Oh, no!    

421441
So you're trolling, amirite? Because, like you, I know every time I go somewhere else, I want to see exactly the same o.s. I could see everywhere else--it makes the adventure so much more enlightening to know everyone lives just the way I do!

The answer? YES. Many of them would be delighted to do so, in order to reach and hold onto the margins of their fan base. And I'm pretty sure that at least a few of them don't like science and so have convinced themselves that if sperm has connected with egg that constitutes "a baby." Implantation doesn't even register in their minds as necessary for a fetus (!) to develop, much less a full-formed at-term infant. 

421671
What is the common denominator in all of these shootings--in church, in theaters, everywhere?--IT'S GUNS!!!!  Every one of these shooters, whether angry or not, whether sane or not, whether legally or illegally purchasing these guns or not--they all have a gun.  Forget finding out the reason how disgruntled someone is--Humans are prone to violence and if they have a gun, they too often shoot people.  It's pretty simple.  Work on the act of getting guns much more difficult; don't arm teachers, don't arm popcorn sellers in movie theaters, don't try to figure out the mindset of these killers--get the friggin' guns out of the marketplace--make it a stringent test to have a hunter's license--monitor the bullets allowed by law, and wake up to reality; otherwise we are doomed to read these reports every day.

Where does the week go Jimbo? Not quite certain but wherever it goes it comes back quicker. At least it seemed that way when I was living in the work-a-day world. Ah, retirement!

How long, seriously, how long can we pretend that unregulated access to guns is not a problem in the US? In order for me to RENEW my drivers license in the state of NJ (which I have had since 1976), I have to show six different points of ID. Shouldn't purchasing a gun and ammunition be at least as rigorous? My co-worker told me she was in her kitchen making lunch at 11:30am and heard gunshots not far from her home (she lives in an urban area). In her kitchen making lunch!!! On a Sunday. Seriously, how long?

Where do you get the notion that mental health in the USA is no different than the rest of the world? Evidence for poorer mental health in the USA relative to most of the rest of the world is very strong, especially amongst developed countries. And yes, I would think it to be very highly likely that anyone who commits murder is mentally unwell (at least accutely at the moment of the crime, if not chronically for a period before). And yes, men commit the vast majority of violent crime in the USA, but THAT actually is true all over the world. Given what you've said, maybe a big part of our problem is that we don't even recognize we have a problem! <br/><br/><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/why-more-americans-suffer-from-mental-disorders-than-anyone-else/246035/#slide1" title="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/why-more-americans-suffer-from-mental-disorders-than-anyone-else/246035/#slide1" target="_blank">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/why-more-americans-suf...</a>

Why are people so angry? Where to start? Spend time watching Fox News, listening to Limbaugh, Beck, Hannity, etc. It's the world of us vs them. Paranoia rules---especially if you're a white guy. Used to be the crazies were limited to some low frequency radio and Tv channels. Now we have congress and state leaders contributing to the craziness and anger. Look at how Gov Abbott (R-Texas) handled Jade Helm. He threatened to call out the National Guard! based on the the paranoia of keyboard warriors. Remember when the birthers were all over Pres. Obama's birth certificate? In an interview with Meet the Press Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) was asked to put an end to the silliness. He wouldn't do it. "It's not my job to tell the American people what to believe." 

422627
Really? More often than not, when I've seen accusations of racism levied by an individual in my career or educational span, it has been by someone whose performance was lacking (VERY lacking, and who got alot of leeway because of race) or whose behavior was objectionable (overt sexual comments, etc.). <br/><br/>Perhaps all you see is racism because that is the way your glasses are tinted. Perhaps it is time for black people to get out of the victim game and just excel. "The Man" doesn't provide you with opportunity? Make your own!

"The root of the problem is a change of management at Verizon"?<br/><br/>Correction: "The root of the problem IS ... Verizon"!<br/><br/>They've always been a price-gouging, anti-customer company with a long-standing record of treating it's workers the same (deplorable) way they treat customers!

423099
Why weren't the reporter, the cameraman and the nice woman being interviewed all armed? That would have prevented this for sure. The problem isn't people carrying guns. The problem is too few people are carrying guns!

Can you make it fun?<br/>My immigrant dad did math workbooks with me even before kindergarten, so I started ahead and stayed ahead throughout school. Mental math and problem solving contests made the subject an enjoyable social/competitive activity, at least until middle school.<br/>I haven't been as disciplined with my own kids, but not wanting to leave math teaching only to the public school system, I started having books/materials lying around the house pretty early on, and my oldest found math-related things online that he actually found entertaining. So far so good. Below are some resources that have helped.<br/>- Multiplication placemat plus shameless cash prizes for memorizing sections (bonus for completion)<br/>- Go Figure!: A Totally Cool Book About Numbers (Big Questions).<br/>- Primary Grade Challenge Math. Great book - goofy cartoons to grab their attention, story-like coverage of different topics (fractions, negatives, algebra, etc.), different level problems to check understanding.<br/>- Secrets of Mental Math: The Mathemagician's Guide to Lightning Calculation and Amazing Math Tricks.<br/>- local contests - we tried <a href="http://mathleague.org" title="mathleague.org" target="_blank">mathleague.org</a> which didn't require an actual school team. ~$15 plus a Saturday morning, and you get to see other kids who dig this stuff. Actually I was floored by the huge teams at some schools which, not surprisingly, were heavy on immigrant parents.<br/>- online resources: khan academy including Vi Hart videos, SchoolHouse Rock, probably a ton out there.<br/>Good luck!

It should not be acceptable for parents to say in front of their children "I was terrible at math" or "I hated math,"  When was the last time you heard someone boast they couldn't stand reading? Yet adults do this at parties with their peers all the time.  Parents are giving their children an out and creating the anxiety with these types of comments.  I will never forget a parent on back-to-school night, who was herself a Chemistry teacher, and she told her son "I was always terrible at Geometry."  Likewise, you shouldn't tell your kids how good you were at math.  You don't tell your kids how pretty you were.<br/><br/>Ask your kids to do math all of the time!!  That is how you break the anxiety.  Get them to estimate...get them to calculate a fair cost of a toy or wage for a chore. Ask them how far away they think grandma's house is? How do they know? How does that compare to their friend's house?  How many ways can they spend their money?  Is it really hot today?  How does it compare to last year?  <br/><br/>Problem solving should be fun. Our kids don't need to be better at math, they need to be better at problem solving.  (The SAT doesn't test math, it tests problem solving. ) Next time you help your kids with homework, remember to say "This is so fun! I sort of remember this!"  Just as you would if they were picking up a book you read as a child.

"Becoming"?!? That happened years ago.

Please, please, can our government and its people be spurred by these and so many other unbelievably horrific events we have endured to clamp down on the rules on gun ownership? When it comes to owning guns, it is an embarrassment to be an American, as worldwide statistics show (88 guns owned for every 100 American adults...!). Should the gun lobby really be having the last word? 

423255
Maybe you are missing the camels for the hump?! :)  or the other way around. There are 2 humps at each horizontal level, and each hump is made out of a camel, so if you consider both humps coming from the same camel, they can be considered visualizing bactrians, too, if you want to think of them that way!

Why are the costs of these drugs so high? Who are we supporting here?  It's not supporting the researchers or the doctors who prescribe the drugs.  It's definitely not helping the patients if they can't afford the drugs or the copays.  So maybe we need to look at the executive level of payment or the money spent on marketing the drugs to everyone.  Most of us know that we cannot afford decent medical care if we become ill with something that requires long term treatment, have an accident, or have a chronic condition that requires constant monitoring.  We know that there will be no real continuity of care, that our doctors prescriptions will be questioned, our claims denied, and that we will have to fight with our wealthy insurance companies to get the coverage we paid for.  (And these same companies underpay the people who field the calls that are made by irate patients who are need of care, not more stress.)<br/><br/>I'll bet anything if we follow the money it goes to the CEO or the entire executive level who live in palatial homes, have all the help they need, can pay for whatever medical care they need, and who don't worry about where the money for next month's rent or utility will come from.  I'll bet that they also don't worry about how the cost of their miracle drugs forces people to make unpalatable choices:  food, shelter, education, or a cure.  Of course a cure isn't worth much if you can't afford it or it leaves you impoverished.  But you're cured!

So murder is the answer?  God help us..!

Cheap exploited workers ? Exactly ! On the one hand we say, "Go back to Mexico !" but on the other we want their cheap labor. Which is it?  We want them to work in the fields for next to nothing picking our vegetables and fruit. We want them to work in sweatshops. We want them to mow our lawns for next to nothing. We want them to babysit our children for little pay. But we want them to leave ! Make up your mind. I can tell you this, if Trump succeeds at shipping them all out, then prepare yourselves to pay twice as much for your food !    And the man at Home Depot who supports Trump can prepare to lose his job as well. Illegals are contractors who frequent HD. Less business&gt; fewer employees needed&gt; stores close. No one thinks of these things.<br/>The majority of them are family-oriented poor people who want to feed their families.  They are not the rapists and murderers that Trump speaks of. Those are the minority, just as the mafia are the minority in the Italo-American community.<br/>It is amazing how eager people are to believe the lies. But then, I suppose that is the cornerstone of racism. Believe it because you want to justify your racism. 

423781
How many more senseless murders will it take for the legislators to pass common sense gun laws? What excuse on Earth can there be for not mandating background checks for purchases at gun shows? The vast majority of Americans are for it!<br/><br/>We truly have some of the worst politicians in the country's history.  I am feeling so disgusted right now! God help us all.

WHY would a New York Times writer, covering a flashpoint event that occurred in New York, turn to a professor in Arizona to get the facts? Not enough gays in New York who can explain the facts with authority?<br/><br/>I worked for the Stonewall owners who opened a gay club on West 10th Street three years after the riot. I knew Marsha Johnson, who never claimed to throw the first brick, but told me plainly that she threw the first bottle when the Fire Department tried to force all the patrons out into the street. (Yes, Fire Department; the NYPD showed up later, when things got out of control. First, the NYFD attempted to harass the owners with a violation inspection at almost midnight.) The absence of an African-American transgender person in the forefront of that movie trailer should give everyone pause. That trailer is flagrant "whitewashing." <br/><br/>Coverage of the actual 1969 event in the New York Times, frequently viewed as our city's historical record, is regrettably meager. Traipsing to Arizona to get the facts from a professor who states on record that "We know nothing conclusively," only exacerbates the Times' missed opportunity to get the story right . . . again!  Would you please talk to those of us who actually lived through that chapter? We're a whole lot closer, and apparently more informed, than Arizona professors. Some of us even subscribe to the New York Times.

"The awful, constant violence in America goes deeper than the proliferation of guns;"<br/><br/>But seriously? Who cares? Though that sounds flip, I truly don't care about any more analyses about our supposedly declining society, and my eyes glaze over reading all the posts about 1) video games and violent movies; 2) antidepressants; 3) the terrible state of mental health care; 4) fluoride in the water; 5) vaccines; or 6) deep cultural pathologies blah blah. No doubt we are one effed up society, but spare me more bogus psychoanalyzing of society.<br/><br/>It's the guns, stupid! Put down the guns! Put them down, walk away, and pass a bunch of bold laws outlawing them. We shouldn't be walking around with these things - people get hurt! Yes, I'm screwed up, you're screwed up, the whole society is screwed up - isn't that why we shouldn't all be walking around armed?!

424481
Trump likes to remain in control (and who does not?)<br/><br/>This exchange was too comical to take very seriously. Mr. Ramos was out of order and Trump was right to insist on that the reporter he called upon be next, however being 'right' is not always shrewd. It would have been better to be shrewd than 'right' and engage Mr. Ramos. <br/><br/>That said, nothing happened here of consequence unless one wants to bicker about table manners. If Republicans want Trump they can have him, but good luck selling this guy to the "47%".  <br/><br/>No matter how hard I try, I simply cannot hate Trump - he is too entertaining in a mad hatter sort of way. Jeb! is self-immolating, Walker is a stalking zombie for the Koch brothers, and that leaves the field wide open on the GOP side of things.

Huh?! That's not journalism. How about banning guns like in Europe.

424593
Not Trump dodging Ramos? You've been watching Donald Trump so long you've been numbed. All Trump DOES is dodge. "It'll be easy! I'm a builder!"<br/><br/>Ramos did not ask about Donald Trump's lawsuit against Univision. This did not prevent Trump from using that as an "answer" to Ramos's questions.

Oh dear, so I can't say anything about the theme?<br/><br/>I did enjoy the puzzle, and was clearly on the right wavelength from the start (a nice change from earlier puzzles this week, where I was just slow).  I pondered "box with handles" for a few seconds and CB RADIO popped into my head.  FATHOM was too short for 15A, so it immediately became SEA MILE; I saw 8D was CRU so 16A had to be RAIMENT &amp; 18A had to be UNPACKS.  So boom! the whole NE was done.  Of course, then I put ELLISON instead of HG WELLS, so that had to be undone.  And the rest of the puzzle didn't go nearly so fast, but it was sure a fun start.<br/><br/>I didn't think I knew Mr. T's character name, but when I had about half the letters I saw it.  TEA before ALE.<br/><br/>After looking at the finished puzzle and trying to figure out the unusual property, I thought of the Korean golfer, but wasn't quite sure what his exact name was.  And I should have thought of the Celtics coach, as I was living in Boston then and grew up about a mile from where the coach went to college.  The grid layout was also interesting, but I can see how laying out the theme entries (7, 8, and 9 letters long) was a challenge.

Iraq? No.<br/>Afghanistan? No.<br/>Syria? No. .....<br/>A strip mall in Virginia. Yes folks, this is what we have come to.<br/>Well done! Well done! To the NRA folks, To Mr. LaPierre, Mr. Andrew Arulanandam and their brothers and sisters in arms (pun intended). Another notch in your belt of death and destruction. With your twisting of the Second Amendment (originally meant to help militias organizing against the British) into policies of all guns everywhere for everyone are accomplishing what the ISIS savages have devoted themselves to doing: killing any and all Americans.<br/>And please STOP trying to spin it with the usual “now is the time to grieve and it is a shame that people are playing politics with this” or the old chestnuts: “guns don’t kill people,” “ban cars/knives/,” “if only there had been a good guy with a gun” … you name it.<br/>I propose that the US Capitol and every single state house be made into an open carry area with no metal detectors and where everyone can walk around with loaded weapons, our sacred right to bear arms no? … then let’s see how these hypocrite elected officials (who protect their own lives but not that of citizens they are sworn to serve) feel about the whole issue. There is something fundamentally wrong with a place/party where it is easier to get a gun than it is to cast a vote. <br/><br/>My deepest condolences to the families, &amp; loved ones of innocent, young Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward, who had done NO wrong and who simply did not deserve to die so savagely.

Have you visited lately? We still have our culture, our great food, our great music, the impromptu second line in the french quarter among strangers, and great parties. Its not all doom and gloom down here.......and we know there's still work to be done.<br/><br/>I just wish that everyone would stop magnifying race issues, especially the media. It causes a deeper rift for people who are trying to just get along as a community down here. People who are uncomfortable living around different races should not come to New Orleans because it is a diverse community and I think proudly so! 

425139
Christine,<br/><br/>Is it your theory that if there were no guns that killings like this one would stop? If it is you have failed to recognize that ISIS has demonstrated a number of ways to murder their victims without the need to use a firearm. <br/><br/>All of those ways are readily available everywhere. "Inanimate objects don't commit murder. People commit murder!" If you would stop the killings, first stop the killers!

425310
Do we blame the 4 year old who accidentally shot his/her sister or brother or do we blame availability of gun in that house? We don't blame the babies, we blame the available guns.<br/><br/>Do we blame workplace racists whose racism triggers some feeble-minded to see no options than resorting to violence? We don't blame the racists; we blame the one who resolve conflict by violence.<br/><br/>In a multiracial/multiethnic society with one-sided power and privilege, where many with skin color advantages see the rest as "other" and want them leave the country and in many cases kill the "other" solely for their race/ethnicity/sex, there'll be anger and rage. If you have guns available for the racists to kill the "other" there will also be guns available for some from the "other" group to resolve issues.<br/><br/>Why do we have guns readily available? We have guns readily available because the advantaged/privilege class see guns as a right tool to keep the "other"class/group in their place while they enjoy privilege alone. <br/><br/>So, gun control in America will never work.  It will never work because it serves a purpose - to keep "them" in check and keep them "in their place". Gun ownership camouflages as constitutional right but the real purpose is to keep the one-sided advantage/privilege going. But these people forgot something; the US is a capitalist country, where if you have the money you can buy anything regardless of race, ethnicity or class.<br/><br/>So we shouldn't be surprised by this Virginia shooting!

I do not understand why any girl - and at 15, nowadays girls can't be as naive as girls were 20 years ago at that age, would go with an 18 year old guy into some closet, takes off some clothes, and expects exactly what? Talk about math? Of course, she or anybody can change their minds about something so intimate as sex and say no and mean it - but unless there are cameras installed everywhere people have sex in such a university setting, or actual witnesses - it will be very hard to prove rape. It always ends up he says, she says. That's the problem: to PROVE consent or no consent. The real issues here are always sex-education and self-esteem, especially for girls who are notoriously afraid to put their foot down and speak up loud and clear. (Why the writer of this article brings in a very clear rape case of a sick, abusive father and his 12 year old daughter, is a mystery.)<br/>We need savvy, outspoken young women, preferably some who find the idea of trotting behind some pimply guy into a closet completely unappealing and out of the question! So, yes, even as a feminist that I am, I find girls must assume a spec of responsibility if they haven't learned to say no at the appropriate moment. Another piece of advice from a former femme fatale. Take off your top and panties only with guys you really really like and know. The chances of being turned off all of a sudden are very slim indeed. How's that for a concept? And yes, clearly, forced sex is rape. 

425670
One commenter, Lily Quinones, says, "he doesn't want to answer any substantial questions especially from a journalist belonging to Univision, the network that banned his pageant"<br/><br/>Well, given Trump's being banned from coverage by the network, exactly why should he not ban Univision from tormenting him under the guise of a reporter supposedly "asking questions", when what that reporter really wanted to do was disrupt and destroy the press coverage to obtain clips Univision could edit selectively to further denigrate Trump?<br/><br/>Trump might as well ban Univision from his press conferences permanently.  The conferences are his, not public events; he paid for them and is entitled to invite whomever he wants.  A press badge -- this will come as a shock and bring shouts of "First Amendment!" -- does not entitle the bearer to crash any party at will.

Love your rose-colored glasses - boy, the 50's were just GREAT weren't they? Women and minorities knew their place and white guys ruled! There were mass shootings back then but of course only local newspapers/TV stations covered it. Now with the Internet - local news is WORLD news. But don't act like the 1950's didn't have mass shootings - 5/2/51 Collinsville, NC 8 shot to death 4/15/53 Lawrence, MA 8 shot to death 1/28/56 Troy Hills, NJ 6 shot to death 10/2/56 Clinton, NC 6 shot to death 3/5/59 Lancaster, OH 6 shot to death and on and on. Sure the numbers have increased but so has the firepower. So tell those families back in the 1950's who had relatives shot to death that "we saw none of this." YOU saw none of it.

What a terrific way to fight crime : just decriminalize  behaviors  ?!    Good grief .  What ever happened to common sense and moral decency  ?

@billhcabk<br/>Could you give us more specifics of who these brazen holier than though fanatic Latino ideologists are?<br/><br/>When Trump flew to our southern border José Diaz-Balart was the very first journalist Trump called upon.  José has news shows on both Telemundo and MSNBC and has been a consistently fair reporter and respected field journalist who IS an American citizen.  José’s brother Mario is a US Representative (R-FL).  Yet even though Trump called on him, he refused to let José even finish his question before splitting off onto a comment deriding Mr. Balart.  José tried again just to finish his question but Trump simply began lecturing on how he had been told that criminals were crossing the border right THEN although he had nothing or no one to back him up on these wild comments that had no factual basis.  Even our Border Patrol backed off refusing to appear with Trump.<br/><br/>Unsubstantiatiedly bashing folks for being brazen, fanatic, and not getting their way sounds exactly the same as what Trump is doing..  Trump has even stooped to bashing our Japanese and Chinese trade partners in a completely uncalled for tone deaf caricature of Asians!  All in the middle of trashing immigrants from our southern borders and talking about not only repealing our 14th amendment but ALSO making it retro-active!<br/><br/>Trump’s mother is from Scotland and two of his three wives did not attain full US citizenship until after marrying Trump!  Trump’s father Fred’s father was an immigrant from Germany!

425875
Ramos is anti-immigration?  <br/><br/>I think you've got things backward.  In no way, shape, or form is Ramos anti-immigration, nor is he anti-immigrant. He is himself an immigrant!  (A legal citizen of the U.S., in case you're concerned.) <br/><br/>I'm always curious about what people mean when they speak of "taking back America" or bringing America "back to the way things used to be."  Who will the powerful go for after they've succeeded in chasing down and evicting every undocumented person across the U.S.? If we're going back to the ways things once were, will we be resegregating schools, businesses, and whole cities?  Will the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act be unwound further? Will women across America be laid off?  Hey, the anniversary of women's right to vote was this week - will we be eliminating that amendment, along with the birthright citizenship?<br/>So many possibilities....

425927
Clever?  Wily?  Hardly!  Trump did what all bullies eventually do when confronted by courage:  he retreated.

So, when does the Chinese economy surpass America's? Is it still 2025? Or has it been updated to 2028? What are all the prognosticators now saying about the demise of America's number one standing in the world? Wasn't China supposed to just roll the U.S. over?<br/><br/>Wasn't it the same people who said that oil would go to $300 because the Chinese would pay anything for a barrel of oil? Yup. The same old best and brightest who had all those other good ideas about how to run an economy.<br/><br/>Just look at today's report. The U.S. in the 2nd quarter rose 3.7% GDP. China will rise this year ??? America is the economic engine of the world. Not China. China apes America. It doesn't even know how to copy!<br/><br/>President Xi will visit the White House soon. Will he have his tin cup out? Tink, tink, tink....

426000
Arnie, how can the deportation of more than a million people be considered an "open borders" doctrine???<br/><br/>I continue to be baffled by the disconnect....on the one hand, Arnie et al complain about what they see as "open borders." Meanwhile, immigration activists refer to Obama as the Deporter-in-Chief!  How on earth can he be both?  Is he for "open borders" because he favors a pathway to citizenship?  Despite simultaneously deporting hundreds of thousands of people, including breaking up families??

426055
Why do you characterize him as having "emotional idiosyncrasies" -- as though he is a harmless eccentric neighbor -- and not call him what he is: a lying, disingenuous, pompous, conscience-less, amoral, greedy schoolyard bully? "Bombast and bravado?" Really? It is a raging personality disorder!  He gets so much coverage for attacking the press, but the press never confronts him, and meanwhile never calls him out on his hateful insults of immigrants, minorities and women.  You know, citizens. Voters. Viewers and readers. He ridiculed Asian accents!  This is his foreign policy! His main policies boil down to "management" and hiring "the best people."  Please cover his shameless, incompetent and heartless business history.

Israel is "oppressing its Muslim and Christian citizens" and is a "theocracy"?  Complete and total nonsense, you just show your ignorance with statements like this.<br/>And the Arab Peace Plan called for Israel to meet Arab demands for unilateral, tangible concessions on territory along with agreeing to some vague, ill-defined "rights" for Arab refugees and their descendants who fled wars that the Arabs started.  Only after Israel made all these concessions, would the Arab states agree to "peace".   Some peace plan!  And these generous proposals were made in 2002, at the height of Arafat's terrorist war (aka the second intifada) when Israeli civilians were being murdered almost daily in terrorist attacks.   So no big surprise that Israel's response was what it consistently has stated, that if the Arabs (including the Palestinians) really are serious about peace they need to stop making unilateral demands and sit down and negotiate face to face.

426627
Lessons? You can still talk of lessons after all these years? The only lesson, surely, is that no lessons will ever be learned. Certainly not until the people themselves decide that enough is enough and vow to hold their politicians' feet to the fire until sensible action is taken. I say sensible. Not even radical or desirable or even reasonable. Just sensible. Like: Don't give guns to nuts, for starters. But until enough children have been gunned down, enough schools are under lockdown, enough civilians going about their daily lives have been the target of random killings, nothing will be done, except perhaps that the NRA, that Great Defender of the 2nd Amendment (oh yeah, and of gun manufacturers' profits), will advise the free distribution of guns in schools, shopping malls, churches, subways, as the only solution to the gun problem. The more things change, the more they remain the same. Lessons, indeed!

426963
I guess you didn’t hear Trump’s supporter telling Jorge Ramos to Get out of my country? And Ramos is a US Citizen?<br/><br/>You sound like all the neo-con chicken hawks saying that Obama is “weak” for wanting peace and a diplomatic deal with Iran.  The same as the NY Times commenters who thought Putin sounded STRONG in his op-ed in this paper.<br/><br/>Trump having his UUUUGGE body guards force Ramos from the room was WORSE than Christie telling someone to sit down.  These guys were TWICE the size of Ramos. <br/><br/>Ramos stood up to Trump and those repulsive henchmen who surround him wherever he goes.  I am sick of bullies and Trump is the godfather of all bullies...right down to running out on a casino partnership days before it slipped into bankruptcy.  I shiver when I think of all the people who have lost everything while Trump just gets richer.  “The Art of the Deal.”<br/><br/>How can you and others keep saying the same thing that you can POSSIBLY think that Trump is presidential material.  He is an embarrassing ugly American!

427053
"Dark new level"?!!?! Really? How remarkably self-centered. How is the murder of two adult journalists darker than the murder of little children in Sandy Hook? How is this a low level than that slaughter? <br/><br/>How embarrassing for the Times. And how shameful.

Why does Bernie need to compete outside his liberal strongholds?<br/><br/>We've had thirty-plus years of conservatism running rampant throughout this country and its government, and it ultimately led us into a manufactured (and unending) war and into the (seemingly unending) Great Recession.<br/><br/>Yeah, Bernie, start pandering to the right-wingers and the so-called "moderates." Start pulling back on your progressive policies. Let's make room for people and ideas that are wrong about everything, from trickle down economics to an unregulated "free" market to tax cuts for the rich.<br/><br/>Yeah! That's the ticket! What this country needs is another Panderer in Chief who won't fight for anything other than giving more to the people and corporations who already have everything. Sounds good to me! Let's appease the wrong-headed and know-nothings and call it bipartisanship...

427121
Just exactly what are we doing sticking our noses in this middle east mess? Are we trying for world domination? USA uber alles? This policy is madness, we have plenty of troubles right here on the american continent. Stop this trillion dollar drain on the american treasury and start fixing stuff right here at home!

Why’s this a front page story? Larry was slipping and I am glad they pulled the plug on him. He interviewed Beyoncé and chided her with condescending remarks and questions the entire 15 minutes- she’s just a kid Larry! Then, what should have been the close out interview of his career- he interviewed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the most polarizing, anti-Semite of the Middle East and he asked him the trademark, softball questions, “Do you prefer coffee or tea in the morning?” “What do you do with your family on the weekends?” Way to go Larry! You had your chance- you blew it, now retire in peace. 

427395
How far back should this country go to be "where it ought to be"? The 90's and the 00's when several of Trump's businesses went bankrupt? Or perhaps the early 90's when Trump had a relationship outside of his marriage to Ivana that resulted in a divorce, which was followed by the birth of a daughter with Marla Maples which was followed by his marriage to Marla followed by a divorce and another marriage? Three wives! Children born from each!  Some born when he was actually married to the mother! He obviously is a living embodiment of a GOP that values families because he has so many of them!  Maybe go back even further to the 60's when Trump got his medical deferment so he wouldn't have to serve his country? How about instead of moving backward we move the country forward.  We can do that with someone who isn't a bully; someone who has well thought out policies to improve the US and actually tells us what they are; someone who wants to better the country and the world that can respectfully disagree and find  common ground with those who think differently rather than attacking, belittling and having a temper tantrum that even kindergartners have outgrown. 

427825
How many times can the New York Times write the same story in a 25 year period? It's not like this is the first article that has ever been written detailing top Democrat's consternation over yet another Clinton scandal, their shocked wonderment over the audacity of Clinton poor judgment, and their pathetic incessant bleating about how Clintons' self-made crises are an 'overblown' conspiracy of Clinton enemies. I mean, how many times does Ed Rendell have to be quoted making the same tired defense of the indefensible before he realizes the 'First Couple' have played him for a proverbial sap? I simply don't understand why any Democrat expects anything different from the Clintons after a quarter century of corruption and scandal. For Heaven's Sake, she stole the White House China and was forced to give it back!

427954
The attention the media give Hillary? You jest. That attention has been almost without exception negative, biased, and focused on emails rather than the issues. You can't scathing opinion pieces by Maureen Dowd! Please, take Hillary's media coverage!

Where to begin with Trump? You know, I'm not sure why Americans seem to be so impressed with Trump "telling it like it is", which seems to be his likeness, as if we don't know how it really is? Do we really need a person who is so deep in big business, which is killing this country, tell US what's wrong with our government? Are we really that starstruck? Let's get over that, shall we? Instead of drinking the punch, let's get to the punch. He has absolutely no sense of diplomacy. His first priority is himself. I do not trust him and cannot see why anyone would. He's already admitted to giving his money to politicians in exchange for favors, isn't that something we want to STOP in Washington? He is not a man of the people for the people!! Big business and billionaires alike are the reason the middle class is disappearing. HE is one of the reasons the poor pay more taxes. He's one of the 1% people! He's one of the people most of this country protested against a few years ago!! He's been blatantly racist and sexist and arrogant. People need to stop confusing this dog and pony show for a real concern for this country and it's citizens. 

428392
Dear Donald,<br/><br/>If you can't handle an "over zealous" reporter, what will you do when a member of Congress calls you a "liar", in front of the world?<br/><br/>You just showed me, what I've been saying all along.  "A hit dog hollers!"  When someone challenges you or goes with you toe-to-toe, you call in security.  <br/><br/>And by the way, "The Blacks" don't like you.  No, I don't want to count your money, but I'd sure like to give you a piece of my mind.

428456
Am I speaking with the real T Bone?! If so, then you know that artists never made money from record sales. The only thing that's changed is corporations no longer control what is popular, and touring has become much more lucrative.

428552
Sorry - does the FBI work for the Republicans?  Is the A.P. lawsuit (around FOIA) related to the Republicans?  Did the Republicans make the decision to set up this dodgy email construct and then decide to delete 30K emails before turning over said email (in paper form!) to the State Dept?

428762
So if the Assad regime falls, who is to keep ISIS from grabbing up the rest of Syria, and breathing down the neck of Lebanon?  Not the US or Europe.  I am guessing that Israel will occupy Damascus and Mediterranean Syria, with the collusion, perhaps even the aid of Egypt and Saudi Arabia!  You read it here first. Yeeeshh!!! 

428874
The NYT forced Clinton to use a private email server and then to lie about it for months? If so, I guess the NYRT is also to blame for the Clinton Foundation which collected billions in donations from some pretty unsavory countries and people while Hillary was Secretary of State. Yup! The NYT is part of the vast right wing conspiracy.

429074
After years of this fact being obvious and the media continuing coverage of each murder, it takes media personnel being murdered for an article stating that coverage of the shooter is bad to be published in the New York Times?  The fixation with guns and attempting to limit them seems to lead to the media publicizing these type of actions.<br/>Kudos to the writer!

“Can you please not use gender stereotypes implying that women are frequently part of a ‘worshipful cult’ involving actors?"<br/><br/>I have never seen such a worshipful cult as this actor has in cyberspace..and real space, and he doesn’t even have his own Facebook OR Twitter account.  His followers are legion according to The Daily Mail.   The Kardashians or Cait Jenner may have Twitter or Instagram accounts that have millions of followers, Mr. Cumberbatch has NO Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram accounts but there are at least a dozen such accounts that OTHERS have made up that add up into the millions!<br/><br/>For ONE day in March, 2015 there was a Facebook page about his “death” that reached over a million “likes!”  He’s obviously not dead..but one rumor one day brought out a million of these Cumberbabes, Cumberb!%$hs, or The Cumber Collective mourning his loss!<br/><br/>While filming “Sherlock” (with Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson), he was greeted daily by shrieks and screams of young women (older than The Bieb’s contingent).  It was close to Beatlemania.<br/><br/>This son of two wonderful British actors is knocked back by it, doesn’t understand it, and remains the ultimate humble actor through it all.  Even when he married last year he put his marriage vows in just a plain vital statistics column in the paper.<br/><br/>He became angry when his fans went wild in Hamlet previews seeking phone camera pix and selfies.<br/><br/>So yes it IS a cult!  My female medical colleagues nearly “swoon” when talking about him!

Why is it implied that it is "either-or" for the Democratic presidential nomination?  Why should Joe Biden need to wait until the Hillary contingent and/or the Democratic Party executives decide that Hillary won't run, so it is okay for Joe Biden to run?<br/><br/>We already have Sanders, O'Malley (not that he gets any media attention) and Chafee in the Democratic presidential running.  What's wrong with Joe participating in Democratic primaries too?<br/><br/>If Hillary is afraid she can't beat these guys in her own party, and one of these candidates could do a better job in debates and the polls, then she won't be a viable challenger to the Republican nominee for president.  Let us see who does the best job and polls the most primary votes.<br/><br/>The worse thing that could happen is that the Democrats will lose the presidency too.  Imagine a Republican House, Senate, Supreme Court, and Presidency and what that would bring for this country.<br/><br/>Run Joe run!!  Putting Elizabeth Warren on the ticket as VP sounds like a great idea too.  

430004
If the DemParty is so concerned why don't they support her? As I've said countless times... The DemLeft which controls the party wants to lose. And they are doing a DemGood job of it!

So what? I found it deplorable when Republicans did it, and then they lost the next two elections. I find it deplorable that a Democrat who CLEARLY had enough experience to know what she was doing took the same deceitful, arrogant, dishonest and WRONG path, and then thought she could joke her way out of it. As a Democrat who goes all the way back to George McGovern, I want to vomit when I think that I USED TO believe in her!

430203
Why?<br/>This is just the pendulum  swinging wildly in the opposite direction.<br/>Changing:  "All Confederate; all the time,"  to:  "No more Confederates; EVER!"<br/>Changing the name of the school will not erase the fact of the Confederacy or of the Civil War.  (Can any war ever be "civil?").  The War happened, was fought, was won and lost.  Many soldiers fought well; many generals led well.  Many didn't.<br/>We as a country ought not to be still fighting it.<br/>Guys, it's over.  We can't change the outcome. We all, South and North, can't change one tiny jot.<br/>We all need to accept that fact.<br/>Instead of wasting time and energy changing the name of a school, start a literacy project. Raise money for after school programs, free school breakfasts, tutoring programs, life skills classes,<br/>parenting classes, health clinics, citizenship classes (it really IS our country), art, music, dance, gardening,  etc., etc.<br/> In other words, life affirming, helping activities create communities; for everyone.

Am I the only one who's bored with this coven of clowns?<br/><br/>Enough about them!<br/><br/>As much as I dislike and disagree with Bush, at least he's for real.

Oh? Let's look at the Obama record on corporate profits, a good sign for judging government's impact on business during challenging economic conditions: "After-tax profits for American corporations hit another record high last year (2014), rising to $1.68 trillion." Third record year in a row!<br/><br/>Let's look at US GDP growth: Forbes says the economy in 2014 had its "the best full year growth since 2010." Then consider personal consumption expenditures (PCE, or consumer spending): 2014 "was the strongest PCE gain since 2006." (Forbes.)  Uhhm. Let's look at the federal deficit, surely the "zero" business experience of the entire administration will show up as big increases: Obama has cut the size of his deficit by nearly two-thirds, dropping each year since 2010 (the end of the recession), from $1294 billion to 474 billion! <br/><br/>Surely such an overreaching government with no business experience would make a muddle of job creation and kill jobs: despite vehement opposition by the Republican controlled Congress to job growth measures and infrastructure repair and modernization, along with increased pressure from China, the Obama Administration has produced 64 straight months (5 years!) of job growth, helping to create 12.8 million private sector jobs! The longest period of sustained job creation in our nation's history--since stats were first kept in 1939, there has "never been a period this long without a decline." (WaPo.)<br/><br/>If you ran a business on bias, w/o facts, you would be broke!

430478
And what do the Republicans do?  They run the entire GWB administration from private Republican National Committee email accounts!  In both cases, unwise, but not illegal at the time.

“Where Is the House of Thy Father?”   Two days before he died, the ring finally fell off.    This is pure poetry in life!   <br/><br/>They lived a RICH life.  Not because of their money, either.   Because they had each other.

So you’re saying the proper way to plead that the media stop giving so much airtime to the perpetrators of such horrific tragedies as we saw yesterday is to not suggest it at all? Isn’t this how positive change DOESN'T happen?<br/><br/>Ironically, it’s sometimes necessary to make a loud “Shhhh!” sound in order to stop people from making noise.

What did we do before technology? We bought a newspaper, books, and magazines and relaxed. We carried laptops to do some work. Some people carried dead tree materials (a/k/a paper). For a few hours, we were disconnected from the rest of the world and guess what, we not only survived but thrived.<br/><br/>We do not need to be connected all day, every day. Whatever happens in the world while you are disconnected will wait until you land. Unless you're someone like POTUS, your job is just not that important to be that connected. If you think it is, then you really need to rethink what you are doing. <br/><br/>Yes, I've worked in high stress jobs. For some of the jobs, I was involved in situations where lives were on the line--and I am not talking figuratively. When I flew, I made sure that others could cover for me because I really couldn't do anything while in the air. It would have to wait until I landed regardless.<br/><br/>Unless you are dealing with life and death situations, stop at the bookstore in the airport. Go old school and buy yourself a book. Take your shoes off and relax. You probably haven't read a book since college or high school. Try it again, you might find you enjoy it!!

How did all of you"connected" people survive even just 5 years ago? Maybe this was one of the hidden causes of all of the bankruptcies and foreclosures of the downturn... No internet access while traveling!!!

Incomprehensible by time?!<br/>That is impossible to predict, but I will tell you that I just finished reading Dante's "Commedia", in a magnificent translation and fully annotated by the great scholars Robert and Jean Hollander and it was one of the most profoundly revealing statements written in history. Sad that most people cannot get motivated to challenge themselves, but the fact is that it is still being read----miraculously more than 700 years later.<br/>"Othello" remains fully graspable if, again, with a good group of notes.<br/>One must always try to resist mental "comfort".

Why would THAT consideration ever cross his mind? Really! That's not a bug, it's a feature for all the RWNJs these guys are competing for.

A Hillary supporter makes an absurd observation:<br/><br/>"During Hillary Clinton's watch did we go to war on a lie with tens of thousands dead and crippled for life [as we did when Colin Powell was SOS]? Not at all!"<br/><br/>But Hillary voted for that war, and undoubtedly would have had the same view had she been SOS then (or president). In fact, if her supporters had written her off based on her support of the Iraq invasion, they would have been done with her 13 years ago, as I was.

@Janis<br/>You know what?  If we didn't have opportunists somewhere, we wouldn't get anywhere.  Obama was being supremely opportunistic in 2007, when he decided--against all odds--that he had a shot at the presidency.  And that certainly didn't turn out so bad (the kamikaze GOtP opposition nothwithstanding).  Bring on the opportunists!  Just let them be the right opportunist for the right time.

Are you an independent contractor who likes to work independently?  Great!  Now you are automatically unemployed!  You can thank the anti free market Leftists in the Obama Administration.

Who needs gun control? If I had a gun, and I was there, I could have helped. After he very quickly shot all the victims, taking everyone by surprise, I could have drawn my weapon and shot him. I need my guns so I can do this. Forget about the fact that he shot himself. It could have been my bullet instead of his. For this reason, I need my guns. I can read and know my rights! I know the second amendment says I can have a gun no matter what. (I just conveniently STOP reading when it talks about a well organized militia -aka the national guard.) And I really could have been helpful here if Virginia would have let me have my machine gun!

May I say something radical? Was Donald introduced into the GOP race deliberately to basically destroy it and hand over the race to Ms Clinton?  Or...is he really saying things on illegal immigration (which is now a global problem) and trade that makes sense to those who are sick of "pandering, pusffy footing and people fooling"? Cannot figure this one out!<br/><br/>We do have a lot of illegal immigrants who are even voting...and they should not be. Illegal immigrants themselves are struggling and suffering...stuck between their old country where they are neglected and abused and the new country where they are exploited and are not wanted. It is a horrible place to be. The answer is to help Mexico get its act together so poor people are served better, and do not have to flee in horrible conditions in ways that take away their dignity and pride. <br/><br/>Also, in all this hullabullo legal immigrants and their issues have been completely forgotten. Who is representing them? There are Ph.Ds who have a hard time getting their Green card, are living off cheese and stale bread because they are stuck in exploitative university work. Who is paying attention to these legal immigrants and their struggles? I guess legal immigrants should pack up and go...so Trump and his illegal immigrants can have perpetual debates that NYT can report on. 

432231
Seriously?  You're calling 'simplify the tax code' and 'eliminating tax loopholes' Republican ideas?  You're not paying attention.  This, and every other, Democratic administration has put those goals on the table, only to have them taken off the table by Republican poison-pill amendments and dark money cronyism.  Look at the congressional record for tax proposals and tell me Democrats don't want a simplified tax code and to eliminate loopholes.  I dare you!

432301
Why these unfortunates are forced to leave their homes, families and lives? In reality; they are paying for the SINS of Bush-Cheney –Oil Kings and thereafter Obama-Hillary who have crippled their mother lands and are still doing in several parts of the world. Europe is paying dearly for moral and material supports but the main culprits are still FREE!! WHY??? America must take responsibilities rather than shedding crocodile tears.

Don't these folks get it? U.S foreign policy is made in DC of, by, and for the benefit of the U.S.  Whether it is of benefit to another country is irrelevant.  If these folks think the deal must benefit Israel then let them move there and get involved in Israeli politics and foreign affairs. This is the USA and our policies are and must be made for OUR benefit not someone else's. END OF DISCUSSION!

You know what, Jim?<br/><br/>Just for you, and I mean in your honor, I will post a clip of Donald Trump's latest appearance on CNN.<br/><br/>Do me a favor, Later today, after I've posted it and you've watched it, leave a comment on my blog translating for all of us what, in terms of policy prescriptions, Trump is calling for.<br/><br/>I can do the same for all the others. I challenge you to explain to us, in coherent terms, what all those policies are, and how exactly they're supposed to fix what's wrong.

Israel is in danger of being destroyed by Iran and these Jews who favor the Iranian deal see no danger for their Coreligionists as if it didn't exist?.<br/><br/>Iran has no history of military aggression.<br/>Iran has not used her military to attack a foreign nation in over 200 years. Israel has sought to, and become, "the mad dog of the MidEast". I can see why Iran would want to defend herself, particularly against unlawful bombing attacks by Israel.<br/>Iran is not invading or occupying any People as Israel does. Iran is not threatening anybody for more than 250 years,<br/> And it doesn´t have nukes  while Israel  has hundreds ready to be used.<br/>Israel is eager to drag America and Europe to wage a war for it against the Iranian People.<br/>America must look after itself first. And it's the Secretary's duty to do just that: America First!

433236
They aren't just saying death to Israel - it's death to America, too?<br/><br/>That is true. But it happened in the past.<br/>Iranians of today want peace. They have young population who has different<br/>opinion than their elders.<br/>Mr.Rohani speaks Diplomacy and Peace. Netanyahu speaks wars and bloodshed. Israel is the true threat to all nations of the M.East. Long live the Iranian People including Iranian jews!!

What does ISIS want? War! Bloody war between western civilization and the quarter of the world’s population who call themselves Muslim. ISIS wants to be the face of that Islam conjuring images of savagery, death, and destruction.<br/><br/>They are savages but their savagery is a little too theatrical and the theological reasons given for slaughtering people and destroying the artifacts of history carry the sharp smell of the stockyard. They’re taunting us, hoping that we will blunder into a fight they can control. (Alas, history seems to be on their side, they know us better than we do.) Their obvious intent is to cause western societies to fear, and ultimately to attack, the peaceful Muslims bringing all of Islam to jihad.<br/><br/>Our task is to remain civilized, and to have patience in the face to terrible provocation. We can win but only if we wage the war on our terms, not theirs.

" if this was a Republican secretary of state running for the presidency, who had elected to forgo the use of government email servers in favor of a private server in their home, would they be as casually dismissive? " <br/><br/>What, do you mean like *every* Seceratary of State before her? Were you aware that Colin Powell also used a private email server? Heck, Kerry's the *first* Secretary of State to use the Department's servers primarily. <br/><br/>Since this is just another offshoot of the ever-running Benghazi(!) investigation, I'm sure that republicans will fully investigate every single aspect of this with a microscope, and the NYT's will be there to print their press releases/leaks for us to wring our hands over.

434216
I'm sure we could commit our armed forces to eliminate ISIS and I'm sure they'd be successful, but then, what? What group will spring up in place of ISIS? We need sophisticated strategies in order eliminate the environments that breed this type of fanaticism. We don't need another person simply beating the war drum, leading us further into the quagmire!

434346
Will all of the posters - especially the 'life-long Democrats' - please check their facts?<br/>The FBI is *not* investigating Hillary Clinton.  It is, under the orders of a judge, attempting to determine if there has been a 'national security breach.'<br/>It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that our entire government has some cyber security problems.<br/>Alert! These aren't Hillary Clinton's fault either.<br/>The NYTimes should be ashamed of itself for not offering a clear and unbiased view of the 'scandal.'<br/>There has not been one credible allegation made, only suppositions and rumors and speculation, mixed with extraneous information that sounds 'technical.'

Why would you want to go to a restaurant to eat any of this food?  If I'm going out to eat I want to eat something new, special and unique.  This is all filler food for people who prefer to eat out all the time rather than take the time to cook for themselves.  And you didn't even mention alcohol!

Another war?  And of course America should lead this war and fund it and shed the blood.  <br/><br/>No thanks!

Of the two  1) being votes and 2) being money which one do you think has the most influence on our bought and paid for politicians? <br/><br/>In those States in which a "very tight" election happens which also has a large Jewish population, they may be able to provide the difference in votes.  The other 47 States...<br/><br/>Your post is one more reason we need to get the money out of politics.  A pipe dream I KNOW!  Instead of next year in Jerusalem maybe the new mantra will become Next year we stop the payoffs.

What Is Dinner in the Hamptons Like?<br/>“One evening, X and I were listening to this simply heart-rending story on public radio about this absurdly impoverished village in Africa, where the inhabitants die before the age of 25, because of contaminated drinking water from a local mining operation. I turned to X, and I said, ‘Wow! Isn’t there anything we can do about this?’ After a little investigation on the Net, I learned that the women of this village make these absolutely delightful beakers and bowls out of dried animal feces. First I thought, ‘Ew!’ But then you could’ve just seen the light bulb over my head: Why don’t we market their handicrafts to the world? How better to help people than to monetize them? Isn’t creating commercial value what life is all about?<br/>“I talked X into it, and he and his good friends at the hedge fund put together the money, through their own brand of magic, to lend the women of the village $150 to get them started. We made several trips there to oversee production, and they were just wonderful to us—of course, I never expected special treatment just because I was the most important thing ever to happen to them. Slowly but surely, I won them over with my infectious unaffected altruism. One thing lead to another, and it wasn’t long before you could buy fecal crockery in every luxury shopping destination in America and now London and Paris, and hopefully Rome by next year, and I’m sure you’ll all want to pick one up before you leave tonight.→

Oh please, the Pope as the anti-Trump?!!<br/><br/>Hey, I'm no Trump fan, but his only inherent power is a bunch of money and the power to kick someone off a TV show he ran. The Pope controls orders of magnitude greater wealth and kick people out of their deeply held religion, not to mention put the fear in them of (if not actually consign them to) hell.<br/><br/>The current Pope says a lot of things many people, including non-Catholics like. Fine, but if you invest greater authority in him because of it, then that authority is there to be used by the next Pope who may advocate things you detest. <br/><br/>As to Trump, it's largely naught but a media circus which Commenters, the Times, Fox, Limbaugh, and everyone else plays into because entertainment is not only easier to cover than is actual policy but, more relevantly, it acquires more readers, watchers, and listeners, producing scads more revenue in the process.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the rest of the Republican candidates love Trump because he allows them to appear to be moderate without actually having to moderate any of their positions or demonstrate actual knowledge of issues and real world solutions.<br/><br/>I would like to see the Times devote as much energy and column inches to analyzing the words and deeds of the other candidates as it does Trump.

Wow, is this the Internet? The opinions in the article seem to be from sane, informed adults! How can this be?<br/><br/>As someone who once did a bit of planetary astronomy, I'd not denigrate any of the choices discussed, but think that in terms of practicality (aka cost) and significance I'd first go for robotic missions to the lunar surface and asteroids, then Mars and major planet moons. That would take decades to do right. But, given the iconic value of human space flight, it would be advisable to work in some Apollo 2.0 landings on the Moon while the rest of the stuff was going on. Maybe an occasional trip to a near-Earth asteroid.

An article about gardens and outdoor space in NYC and no mention of the garden co-ops and garden homes in Jackson Heights? <br/><br/>They're a perfect example of urban planning that incorporated private green space really nicely. Unfortunately the public green spaces were developed over time, but the gardens are flourishing!

Hi-<br/>Could you possibly substitute my second comment sent to you rather than the one you printed?<br/>The second one is much cleraer and concise.<br/>Thanks either way!<br/>Nat Solomon

Ugh, have you no sense of wonder? If you could, would you really wind the clock back on space exploration - the moon landings, the Hubble telescope, the planetary missions among many others - and use the money instead for problems here on Earth. Would you erase from our collective knowledge and imaginations everything we have learned from space exploration in order to fix potholes and improve schools? What good is school anyway if we grind our acquisition of knowledge to a stop? Further, it is well documented that money spent on space exploration is returned to the economy many times over because of the economic value of so many of the technologies developed for space exploration. For example, Apple Corporation would not exist if it were not for space exploration because it was through space exploration that the satellite technology that cell phone users rely upon was developed. And that is just one example among thousands!

Miri Regev is minister for culture? On her facebook page she mixed up the Staatskapelle Berlin (Barenboim) and the Berliner Philharmoniker (Simon Rattle) assumed as the world’s best orchestra, then she didn’t realize that Germany is part of the 5+1 negotiations with Iran and therefore supports the Iran deal, and finally she as a minister of culture who opposes the boycott (BDS) against the state of Israel demands herself cultural boycotts against the Iranian people. Unbelievable!

Debbie Wasserman Schultz scowling at the thought of additional Democratic debates?! This tells me all I need to know about the current state of the Democratic party when the Democratic party chairwoman is repulsed at the idea of letting our Democratic process go forward with healthy debate--in the spirit of choosing the best possible nominee. 

436073
Can't we learn from the GOP circus? Too many debates is boring and divisive. <br/><br/>No, I don't know what the optimal number is. But I'm sure the GOP went way over that number in 2012!

Legislators are worried because we "lack a presence" in the Arctic?!  We also lack a presence in the cities, rural areas, the schools, the healthcare system, the environment, the crumbling infrastructure, income inequality, jobs, gun violence, crime, on and on and on.  Spend a lot more time on those issues and maybe we'll let congress go play in the Arctic.

What is the point to encourage the so-called "consumer expending"? Spend more money on military budget! The military manufactures can create tons of high paid jobs and all workers are "patriotic". Look at what US did and always does! Does China have a NASA? Does China have a Boeing? Does China have a decent Silicone Valley? Bullying small and weak countries is totally different from standing up to USA's military mighty. China has a long way to go from this front.

How else to put it? I love Bill Bryson's work and his "Walk in the Woods" is no exception. My junior-in-high-school daughter came home the first week of school recently and said there was a choice for required reading for AP English and one of the books was "something about the Appalachian trail, a walk in the woods or something like that." We went to the local public library in our small, Southern town. All copies checked out. As my daughter returned to the car, I said, "Would this book be by Bill Bryson by any chance?" Yes. "You'll be happy to know that this book is at home in our personal library." My daughter was just happy she didn't have to buy it, but I was glad that we could share something that I really love. Hope she loves it as much.<br/><br/>I'm sorry Mr. Bryson has lost his midwest accent, the gold standard for American-style English. But I understand. Being a Yankee transplant these past 30 years, I was once accused of sounding like I'm from Tennessee. We soak up our environment, to be sure.<br/><br/>Cheers, Mr. B., and keep up the delightfully good work!

WHHATT?  I played a little tennis in the upscale Pacific Northwest - when I wasn't playing golf. Two of my BFFs were on the tennis team, three on the girl's golf team. We were all very good. Soccer wasn't a thing then, but we'd probably had done that well too. Lewis and Clark H.S. in the late 70's had the city's only African-Americans attending. While we had some standouts on basketball, football, track, not many were standouts at golf and tennis - SADLY! But then the Spokane Country Club was shuttered this century for sexual harassment.

How important is tennis on the south side of Chicago? Not very much. How important is it on the upper east side of New York? A lot. Would the New Yorkers  like to feel good about their dedication to a glitzy and glamorous sport? Yes. Hence this article in the Magazine. Enjoy!

Which is worse, a person who pretends to see the future or a person who believes that people can see the future? A person who pretends to talk to the dead or a person who pays money to speak with the dead?<br/><br/>Years ago, I had my palm read. It gave me a good laugh. A friend of mine went to a seer in Coney Island and had her palm read. The prognosis, delivered in an indeterminate (but effective) accent, went something like this:<br/><br/>"I see that sometimes you are happy, and sometimes you are sad. Sometimes you like to be alone, and sometimes you like to be with people . . . ."<br/><br/>How charming is that!

Why is "outing" an alcoholic a problem? Because alcoholism is considered a personal failure rather than a disease? Unless and until alcoholics let people know they have the disease of alcoholism others will think it is a personal problem, as in mental illness. The anonymity fostered by AA is not doing anyone with this disease a favor.  For a long time nobody spoke of cancer. Doctors didn't mention it, the dying were not told they had cancer.  Come on folks! Quit hiding your disease! Unless, of course, you think it is a mental illness?

As every conservative derides President Barack Obama for not doing this, that or the other thing, what has this group of ideologues actually done?  Most have never served in any military war zones, like those that they want to send other people's kids to.  Since they deny evolution, the Earth's ancient geology, American History and global warming, perhaps they have never seen the inside of a science, civics or critical thinking  classroom.  And economics, forget it!<br/><br/>It seems like many in the GOP wish to live in a self-sheltered life.

When the hysterics settle down and reality sets in, it may be that a sincerely authentic candidate like a Biden, particularly with a Warren (or Sanders?) VP, might be just the antidote to the twitchy, over-cautious and unpleasant candidates that have been propelled to the top by pundits and pollsters.  We've forgotten what seriously populist candidates are like, having become self-defeatingly suspicious of anyone who speaks out for the middle class.<br/><br/>The Republican candidates run the gamut from certifiably insane to the merely dangerous to boring, while most of the Democrats are forgettable, given that I can't recall all of their names.  Is this really the best we can do?  And yet the same pundits that frantically tout Hillary and Jeb! routinely write off Sanders and the potential Biden, although I like their brash, confident populist message far more than Hillary's scripted, unconvincing cant, or Jeb's drab, unfocused mutterings.<br/><br/>Dynasty, shminasty.  The only candidates entitled to take the White House are the ones we send there.  Media pundits like to create these little narratives to add excitement to a race starts too early, goes on way too long, and rarely talks about real issues in a way that mirrors the seriousness of the stakes.<br/><br/>Besides, Trump has gotten so much coverage that the media should send us all a personal apology.

What "Intentional Homicide Rate" are you using?  My reading of the UNODC data shows 3,061 murders, with a 4.2 rate for Turkey, and 14,661 murders and a 4.7 rate for the USA (  <a href="https://data.unodc.org/#state:2" title="https://data.unodc.org/#state:2" target="_blank">https://data.unodc.org/#state:2</a> ).<br/><br/>Excellent numbers!  Safe country.  Unless you're Jewish or Kurdish or Armenian.  Ahh, Armenian.  Now if you were Armenian back in, say, 1915, the Turkish murder rate would have been around 14,000 (no, not 14.000 -- 14 THOUSAND) per 100,000.  <br/><br/>Nice folk, these Turks.  Great coffee, great kebobs, a nice Mosque or two.  But just a little dangerous.  Just a little.  Especially if you're Jewish or Kurdish or Armenian.  Especially Armenian.  Nice folk, spiced with just a little genocide.

I'm curious; if your husband was "outside counsel for MCDOnalds", just how would you come to know "that is the reality" without his breaking attorney/client privilege?  Or is that the reason your husband "was" - instead of currently - "outside counsel"?<br/><br/>Again, just curious. <br/><br/>Lastly, do you REALLY think a company "SHOULD go out of business", thus making it even MORE difficult for would-be workers to support themselves?  By that I mean to say do you REALLY believe that "something" - and a relatively substantial something at that! - is worse than NOTHING AT ALL???<br/><br/>All those workers who you believe should lose their jobs....who do you think is going to pick up the slack?  Are YOU???

"Can Trump live up to "traitor to his class" even as he seems to say almost anything that flickers through his mind?"<br/><br/>Not only that, but with few exceptions, he's been saying the same things all the others have been saying. The only difference? He's as rude as they've never dared be. He Trumps them, even at that!

Rita, you said, "Is there any candidate against protecting the American worker against cheap third world labor?" The answer is yes, that would be most of them.<br/><br/>As to platforms, I don't see any great need for or benefit in details at this point. It is the desire and willingness to act that matters.<br/><br/>Trump is, of course, a member of the elite, but as the headline says, a "traitor to his class." Except on immigration and some litmus test issues like abortion on which he's flip flopped for political reasons, Trump is to the left of the other Republican candidates, and in some cases to the left of Hillary Clinton (Protect the American worker? The Clinton's gave us NAFTA!).

@Ross Douthat: Have you been living in a cave for the past couple of weeks? It's not even a question of whether or not Trump will get the R nomination, so prepare to be shocked and amazed. ;-) And even more so when he WINS THE GENERAL ELECTION BY A LANDSLIDE!!! Mark my words!

Really? Do you realize that after stating that you're acting for two reasons you then proceed to list three. The logic of your first two can only lead to one current candidate who rails against Big Money: Bernie Sanders. Your third reason defies logic by stating that you'll vote for someone who accepts "conservative...and progressive proposals" (!!!) These two ideas are actually diametrically opposed to each other and do not coexist - particularly in Mr. Trump's Big Money, Big Donor, 1% world. Think and Analyize carefully before you throw your primary vote away.

What "voice" is that? The Hillary who said she was adamantly against illegal aliens in her Senate race, or the one who is for illegal aliens in her Presidential race? The "voice" said the problem was too much money in politics? Or the "voice" that accepted "donations" to her "charity" from those same sources? Point to one, just one single solitary accomplishment on Hillary's resume that doesn't include her being fired from the Watergate team for ethics? Go ahead. The problem in America now is that "The Moron Vote" has put "The Imbecile Class" in power and the fawning mind numbed delusional, bigoted, mean spirited, insulting etc; are all on your side of the fence. Listen to the rhetoric oozing from them..the race baiting and divisiveness the party that founded the KKK, supported slavery, poll taxes, literacy tests, segregation, church burnings, lynching and more accuse others of. I suppose this is why the democrats have decided they need to whitewash their image!

Dynasties?   Now the wife of an ex-president is a member of a "dynasty".  And having been so dubbed, she then reminds Ms. Dowd of...  George W of course!

People just hear the word "BushClinton" and tune out.

Are we so pampered that hungry is some horrible feeling that will inevitably sabotage any attempts at mild calorie restriction? There are many LARGE communities of people successfully and happily losing weight on calorie restriction... what are they, masochists?<br/><br/>This article is basing all of these horrible effects of hunger on one study of 36 men, living off a diet that appears to be sorely lacking in protein (and variety)<br/><br/>I've lost 45 lbs recently and still have 20 to go, and I did it by paying attention to portion sizes. I don't think anyone can deny portion sizes have gone up, all this "oh we eat too many carbs" or "oh we eat too much processed food" nonsense is muddying the cause of obesity: WE EAT TOO MUCH. Would someone go insane if they lived off the portion sizes of the 1970's? Was everyone back then, when the obesity rate was ~12%, just miserable and hungry all the time?<br/><br/>Do I get hungry? Sometimes. It's mild discomfort. I know everyone's body is different so they may experience it differently, but if you want to avoid it during calorie restriction, eat your veggies. Fibrous veggies like broccoli are very filling yet have little calories, you can eat a POUND of broccoli and it's only like 180 calories. Your body doesn't know how many calories something is, it only knows if something is in your gut<br/><br/>Low carb is not magic. Don't eat so much, eat a variety of foods, and eat your veggies. Do this and you'll be good to go. And teach your children good habits!

You got to be kidding Frank Bruni , John Kasich you say to be a threat to Hillary Clinton ?<br/>Which world do you live in, sir ?<br/><br/>Come and visit OH then, the streets are falling apart like driving in a third world Country, The Airport once busy sitting empty because Delta does not allow any other flights from here. That makes it near impossible for anyone to attend a business meeting because of cancellation of flights. <br/><br/>University areas are full of gang related murders.<br/>Should I mention the drug related crime and worse pollution compared to other states ?<br/><br/>What John Kaisich does ?<br/><br/>He wants to go to Washington !

Old money or new money, what's the difference? It is money corrupting and poisoning our entire Democratic Process. That's where Trump comes in because he is the straight-shooter ( no matter how obnoxious!! ). He has no need for money - his own or others'. What he wants, he gets - FOR FREE!!

Rima,   Have you followed Facebook re Sanders?   I have and am, and his support is enthusiastic.   It's made me a Facebook follower......just because I'm losing faith in NYTimes coverage.  Bernie speaks to my concerns about those left out of the mix, those left behind, and ordinary people who don't have a million to add to dark money and so are voiceless.  Thanks for your comments re Bernie.  Please keep them coming!

The distinction between chronos and kairos was perhaps most memorably played with in the modern era in the introduction to the old Howdy Doody TV show ("What time is it?" / "It's Howdy Doody Time!").  Ask a chronos question, get a kairos answer.

And how do you deal with carb craving?  And with not feeling full without carbs in a meal?<br/><br/>Like you, I lost 70 pounds.  Five years later, I've gained back 30 of them and I'm terrified it will just continue.  I'm not on any "name" diet - I just try to eat lots of fruits, some veggies (not my favorite unless we decide to consider tomatoes a veggie instead of a fruit) and I try to get protein in my diet with skinless chicken and broiled fish.  I'm hungry all the time.  And I am NOT losing weight, even with significant exercise 3 times weekly, which I must continue for my chronic pulmonary problems.  <br/><br/>When I lost the 70 pounds, it was SO easy!  I just lost a pound a week over a period of 2 years.  I did keep it off for a few years, but with age (I'm nearly 72) and the ability to burn fewer calories through exercise due to the progression of my pulmonary disease, it's all coming right back.  I eat NO fast food or junk food and I do not drink soda.  I don't eat much fat - just a bit of butter on veggies and I cook with olive oil.  Giving up carbs and sugar completely would be VERY hard.  My son has done so, but has only lost 9 pounds in one year - he's hungry and ends up eating more high fat meat.<br/><br/>I sometimes think we're battling weight as we would if nature gave us blue eyes and we preferred brown.

Math anxiety ??? Oh yes,---in spades!  Over the course of my 84 years, many of which were spent as a very successful piano teacher, I have concluded that an important component of my math anxiety is due to the fact that many math curricula writers and teachers of the subject don't factor in  the myriad varieties and  sub headings of  learning styles that students present.  Math teachers understand math ( I assume) but certainly don't often understand ways  of making something abstract comprehensible to many differing kinds of people.<br/><br/>I still quake when I hear the term "story problem".

Find a way to change your view of winter in NY as "hateful" (with all the cultural riches around you? such as the dioramas--and more!--at the museum....and theater...and music...and New York's wonderful, wonderful diversity of people!) and you won't have to live for summers.

FAFSA? What a joke. After spending some 4 hours of my time sorting thru the beast, I was told that we should be able to contribute $85,000 per year to our son's education. Really! Provided that we did not want to have a home, car, food, or clothes, this could have worked out.  Well, so much for financial aid, and so much for our retirement. We managed to get both of our kids thru college with savings and myriad "student loans" that I am paying off to this day. Most of the funding for our kids education came from investments that were intended to fund our retirement. So now, we continue to work and will do so until we can recover from the expense of our children's education expenses. That of course will deny jobs to some erstwhile young person for years to come. It seems that I have been paying off student loans forever. First our own, and now our kids.

You can't understand why women find him attractive--maybe because of your personal envy?  Imagine a woman writer talking about a female actress in this way--"I can't imagine why men find her sexy?"  How ridiculously awkward and who cares what you think?  How ridiculously dated your statement will appear in 25 years from now.  Women and gay men are permitted to find someone sexy but a reviewer generally would never comment on this in a review.  Straight men are permitted 90% of the time to find an actress sexy or beautiful and most male reviewers don't find it worthy to comment on this in a review.  Get with the times!

"Who gets to play tennis?"<br/>In Chicago the answer is anyone and everyone! Unlike most cities Chicago does not lack for free public tennis courts. In fact I would argue that Chicago has the most courts per capita of any major city in America. I have been playing tennis in Chicago since 1989 when I picked up the game as a student at the Univerisity of Chicago on the south side. In fact the university maintained 4 beautiful ivy covered fenced tennis courts right on the main quadrangles that were open to the Hyde park community. ( Sadly these were removed a few years back ) but the university has steadfastly maintained many tennis courts on the campus that the community can enjoy. There are numerous tennis courts just in Hyde Park outside of the campus maintained by the Park District. So access is not an issue. What is lacking is a social campaign taken to the kids that makes it clear that tennis is cool and amazing and will enrich your life is so many ways and you will make lifelong friends by participating in this incredible and fulfilling sport.

Remember the explosion in West, Texas?  A bunch of volunteer firefighters were killed there too!  A seniors' centre right across the road!  Such development should never have been allowed near that facility.  But they did and no one said a thing.

Muscle aches??? How about cramping so severe that one is screaming in pain? It started in my feet..generally in the middle of the night. I upped my intake of magnesium and potassium thinking that was the issue. When it didn't help I had my levels tested....both were well within the range of normal. I added drinking tonic water with quinine in place of regular water. Still had cramps. Then, one afternoon, as I was sitting in my recliner, I had the onset of cramps that started in my feet and traveled all the way up my legs. I had to walk for hours and take medication for cramps. That night I skipped my Mevacor. That was last February. I have not take Mevacor since. And, wow, no more cramps!! It took about 2 weeks for them to stop completely. Now, I am a medical professional with almost 40 years experience. I have worked in clinical trials. I understand that my findings are not "scientific" however, facts are facts. No Mevacor, no cramps.

How about not eating meat? That's the easiest way to reduce cholesterol levels for the vast majority of people! God forbid we try a simple, common sense solution when expensive drugs with side effects are available. Cholesterol does not exist in plants! Period. Animals produce cholesterol. Humans are animals. We generally produce just the right amount of cholesterol for ourselves. If we have high cholesterol overwhelming odds are we are eating too much cholesterol laden meat and dairy! Oh, but that would make too much sense and the drug companies and doctors couldn't profit! Oh, and animals wouldn't have to suffer. No... let's not try that. It's official. Our society is sick....

Are you talking about the savings that would occur if many people stopped taking the massively overprescribed statin drugs? They'd be HUGE!<br/><br/>Then statins could be prescribed conservatively, as all drugs should be. No, they should NOT be in the water supply! (That statement is attributed to Dr Ken Reckless. Seriously.)

"Why are republicans against people that are not wealthy?"<br/><br/>The most common reason is that the people who aren't wealthy are a different color than they are.<br/><br/>The scam of right-wing politics in the US, going back to the early 1700's, is "You may be dirt poor, you may be being treated horribly by your boss, but you'll always be better off than a black person!" And they've successfully convinced a lot of poor white people that anything to help out poor people is actually only going to help black people.<br/><br/>A classic example of this: Residents of Kentucky loathe Obamacare and love Kynect. However, what's strange about this is that Kynect is the Kentucky exchange for ... Obamacare! All they had to do to get people to hate it was put a black man's name in front of it.

So what will the Evil Empire and its hedge fund managers like Paul Singer - Seth Klarman - Bernard Marcus - Robert Mercer etc etc who own US say about that?? lol.  No wonder Murdoch and the Neocons despise Trump ... and US  populist folks love him!

Trump's policies are bad? Ha! They're not even policies. He hasn't seen fit to tell anyone how he's going to, for example, deport 11 million people and build that wall. He hasn't said how he plans to do anything-just that it will be "easy" and "great!"<br/>These rubes have been steeped in the idea of their President being a dictator for seven years, and now they want a dictator of their own!<br/>If Trump stays in this thing, I'm curious about how far down the hole the other candidates will go with him. 

441389
How many times will the lie that "the Supreme Court elected Bush" be repeated? Good grief! Even the DNC newsletter published the debunking of this.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/politics/12VOTE.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/politics/12VOTE.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/politics/12VOTE.html</a>

Since it seems impossible to control drug use in sports, why not lift all the rules?  Anything goes!  As fans we'll just sit back and enjoy the home runs, the incredible speeds, and so on. Personally I'm tired of the never-ending issue, does he or doesn't she?  Whenever and whatever the ill effects on the athletes is their problem sometime in the future. Maybe if they take a look at what happened to the East German women who were given so many drugs, they'll give the future some thought.

441406
Why such a strong focus on drugs in track &amp; field? When a baseball player tests positive for drugs he gets suspended for games not years! Is there even drug testing in Football, Basketball &amp; Soccer?<br/>Track &amp; Field is one of the few sports we in America follow that is truly a world wide sport. (Yes, Soccer &amp; Basketball are played around the world but countries do not compete against other countries as they do in Athletics.) So many countries ignore the IAAF and the World Anti-Dpoing Agency.  Therefore their athletes will continue doping.<br/>So why not spend some time to focus on the doping in other countries or other sports.<br/>Like Chuck stated earlier "Nearly every professional athlete in every major sport is doping at some point"

Taxing "carried interest" the same as Labor?  Trump  has really got the business-as-usual crowd in an uproar.  Heaven Forbid!!! Treat the wealthy the same as the working class?  What country is this?  Class Warfare!!!  This cannot be happening to the republican party!!!<br/><br/>I do hope they get the message that this time, things are going to be different.  Y'all better warm up your rigged electronic voting machines if you want to win, eh? Nothing exceeds like excess, and the comfort-the-comfortable-and-afflict-the-afflicted policies have gone about as far as they can go.  Memo to the point one percent:  you already got all the money.  Enough already.<br/><br/>This is going to be fun.

Does he know what he's doing? Or do you mean what he's doing is to run for the nomination. Because I haven't seen any evidence he has a clue how to govern but he sure knows how to promise and spin, Spin, SPIN!<br/><br/>Have we completely lost the ability to judge a person by their actions? The man is a con artist. He's so full of hot air it's amazing that comb over doesn't float away. Go back though his business history and look at how many things he promised and never delivered. <br/><br/>He's a narcissistic 5 year old. He'll say anything to get what he wants and when he doesn't do what he said it will be everyone's fault but his. <br/><br/>Is this really who we think should be President? Does anyone actually believe he'll do any of this stuff?  Congress might have some input into it and they are all still owned lock, stock and barrel by the 1%

@ blackmamba<br/><br/>So? That includes many of the murderers.  Vester Lee Flanagan II, aka Bryce Williams, was one.

Is it any wonder that personality and perception trumps substance when we are so obsessed with celebrity and a politician's brand? Republicans seem particularly mesmerized by style over substance, but that has been the case since Reagan.  Despite the fact that many conservative holy grails like trickle down economic never worked, its failure does not matter to them so long as they advocate it with enough confidence.  Damn the evidence!<br/><br/> Kaufman is right though.  Eventually the façade will come down and we all find out if there is substance to the perception. As GWB showed, there often is not.

A Southern cook who needs to "get better at biscuit making and baking"?  Good grief!  If there is one thing that Southern cooks of ANY color know, it's biscuit making and baking!  They may not be great at lots of other things, but at that, they excel.  <br/><br/>As to who owned the recipe?  That's easy!  It was ALWAYS the cook as she, like Ms Charles never measured anything in her life and never wrote down a recipe.  I remember as a young bride, 49 years ago, calling my Southern white mother for her recipe for buttermilk biscuits.  It called for "enough" flour and "enough" buttermilk and a "pinch" of this and that.  She made them every morning for breakfast when I was growing up and she did it by feel, not by recipe.  Fortunately, my mother or one of her sisters, managed to get a written recipe for my grandmother's wonderful angel food cake.  My mother had so many different recipes for yeast dinner rolls in her old handwritten notebook, that I have no idea which one she actually used and I've never been able to duplicate her results.<br/><br/>The South was poor for so very long.  Yes, there were a few wealthy white women, but most did the same kind of "make do" cooking as Ms Charles.  They cooked what they grew, made jellies and jams and preserves, and did some canning.  Meat?  It was almost always chicken (as most kept their own chickens) or pork (thin pork chops were cheap).<br/><br/>But a Southern cook who makes biscuits with Sprite and can't bake?  Not really a cook.

So, once upon a time you traveled from Brooklyn to the tourist haven of Aix-en-Provence, where you happened to eat soupe au pistou, once, and you're an expert on the matter?  Hats off to you!<br/><br/>Actually, as other commenters have noted, pistou is pesto, not pasta.  It's the past participle of the Occitan/Provençal verb "pistar," which means to pound, as in a mortar.  And apart from most reds, wine in France is very much chilled, including rosé, which in Provence is hardly too fragile for soupe au pistou or any number of other robustly flavored local dishes.<br/><br/>You should have undertaken some better preparation and research yourself before disparaging the author.

442888
Democrats are ultra-left? Only in America!<br/><br/>Democrats advocate for regulated capitalism, market-based healthcare solutions, a diversified energy sector, solvent social security program, accountability and efficiency in governance.<br/><br/>Does the above sound anything at all like ultra left? Even Bernie Sanders, the extreme left wing of our national political spectrum, is considered out of the mainstream because he openly questions our government's prioritization of corporate concerns over all else.<br/><br/>Better start polishing those hammers and sickles, comrade!

Why stop at mountains?! Let's rename the entire state! Better yet let's rename all the states and the country. No wait! Let's rename the whole continent as well as the rivers and seas. <br/><br/>In fact why do we even call it Earth? Surely Neanderthals had a name for it - perhaps a grunt or snort - which we should now adopt as the name of our planet.

How could any politician in their right mind sign a pledge not raise taxes, effectively giving up one of their best tools to govern a country? Maybe that's why only Republicans have signed it.<br/><br/>Also, someone needs to define the word sedition to Grover Norquist.<br/>Go Bernie!

The ultimate question is always "are you better off now than you were 8 years ago?"<br/><br/>For most Americans, the answer is a loud and clear NO. We are not better off. We are far worse off. We've lost health care we liked, and the prices are still going up up up. Now we must pay a huge fine if we cannot afford health insurance -- a double punishment! and for the working class.<br/><br/>After a long period of stable prices, inflation has reared its ugly head. Meat prices are up 300% in 5 years! Milk is up 100%. Local taxes, property taxes -- all way up. <br/><br/>Jobs? Yeah, lots of jobs if you want to work part time at Walmart. Otherwise, not so much.<br/><br/>But thank god, we have twice as many illegal aliens, and now they are guaranteed to stay forever.

443521
And what if they don't?!  We have seen that in countries where women are empowered, that is not happening, and the empowerment of women has already brought great social change for the better.  Men will always try to argue that it makes no difference.  That's an argument that has no basis in the majority of historical experience, whereas it is well known that patriarchy has utterly failed the future.

A better question would be, "What books have most influenced your thinking, and your life?" A follow-up would be, "Do these books belong on a first year reading list?”  My list would include:<br/>1. "Johnny Got His Gun", Dalton Trumbo, 1938.  I bought it for $0.75 at the Fort Ord PX while a draftee in advanced infantry training, practicing "quick kills" on my peers by day and, then, at night, sobbing while reading this very short antiwar book.<br/>2. "Picking Cotton" Students will be convinced that memory is fallible, that eyewitness testimony, even one’s own, can be unreliable, and that our legal system can be unjust.  It was the summer reading assignment for incoming students at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2011.  Every student in my “summer reading” section was touched.<br/>3. "Levels of Knowing and Existence: Studies in General Semantics," Harry L. Weinberg. More memorable than any undergraduate text I read. A night class in 1962. Snippets continue to guide my perceptions of language, and logic, and my personality, and my life.<br/>4. Collected works. In recommending readings for first year college students, I usually vote for breadth rather than depth. Genetics, sociology, economics, literature, history, ... In the tradeoff between breadth and depth, academics, tend to significantly overrate depth -- preferably in their own discipline. Academics tend to disparage summaries, or textbooks. They’re wrong. Read widely!

443622
Biscuits from Sprite and Bisquick?!!! I grew up in the 50's and 60's in the South, learning biscuits and pie crust pastry at my Mother's hand.  Never did she (or my Grandmother, for that matter) use Bisquick or carbonated beverages for breads,  Biscuits are made from shortening or butter with salt, baking powder, and milk (or buttermilk with baking soda added).  Pie crusts are made from flour, salt, shortening, or preferably home-rendered lard (not that hard to accomplish) and ice water.  Using shortcuts is not "make do" cooking, it's a lazy cook's way to get by.

443628
Why is Paula Deen "odious" -- because she is white????  Mrs. Charles worked for her for 22 years, as an employee, not a slave, and if she was that talented, she could have gotten a job elsewhere.  The South grew exponentially at the time, and there were plenty of companies hiring.  The lawsuit was thrown out!!!  What exactly did Paula Deen do?   I think the lawsuit was exactly about making money and getting notoriety.

What does the population of Jamaica have to do with whether or not they're able to produce world class athletes? Excuses! Jamaican athletes have always been in the mix and track and field is hugely popular. Some of you making comments need to do some research about the culture of running in Jamaica. Every school has a sports day and this is basically all about sprinting, not to mention Boys and Girls Champs. If you see the times some of these youngsters run i guess you'd assume that they're drugged up too. No, theyre just now able to shine because drug testing has caught up with the Americans and Europeans. Has anyone beaten Flo Jo's records yet? But yet she keeps her medals while clean athletes such as Merlene Ottey had to settle for silver and bronze. Size has nothing to do with it. Talent is talent...or we'd all be playing second fiddle to the Chinese.

Why is this even in the New York Times?  <br/><br/>What other organized religion gets this kind of up-close commentary and op-ed space in the Times?  None that I can remember.  <br/><br/>The Catholic church is NOT the official religion of the United States.  Please, New York Times -- STOP treating it like it is!

444356
Where are the communion cops, Ross?  The inspectors asking for ID proving the worthiness of the bearer to be on the communion line?  There is NONE.  WHY?  Because it is a matter for that Catholics conscience.  If that Catholic defies the rule, there is confession; which -- as a good Catholic -- you know takes place in booth so the priest is a conduit to God, the anonymity of the parishioner is protected, and -- if the priest can figure out who it is --- he would be violating the sanctity of the confessional.  An even bigger sin, RIGHT?  <br/><br/>The only time "enforcement" of the communion ban would become possible is if the parishioner sought the exception and it wasn't granted and they publicly fought about it so EVERYONE would know what was going on when that person got in line for communion.  So, basically, only Public Defiance would be punished as there is no means of enforcing it. <br/><br/>I've taken the time to post this information because I am sick to death of zealots like you trying to impose your archaic views and positions not only on your fellow Catholics but worse --- trying to spread it over everyone else.  NO ONE is trying to prevent you and other strict adherents to Catholicism from doing what you want ----- just stop trying to impose it on the rest of us (Catholic or non-Catholic) with misleading opinion pieces like this one!

Can people say stuff like this with a straight face?  "If those are the policies he implements, they’ll drive the economy into the ground and we’ll see huge drops in G.D.P., and frankly I think it would lead to massive loss of jobs.”  Massive loss of jobs!  Is he kidding?  Hasn't this 1%-er lackey noticed the evacuation of jobs from U.S. shores since NAFTA?  Get these people OUT!

Loss of jobs?  So tired of the spin ALL THE TIME!  My Dad went to Hershey School for boys... guess where Hershey went (and IS still going)?  MEXICO!  I guess those who worked in those plants for most of their lives didn't LOSE their jobs!  I guess my Dad worked at Bethlehem Steel and didn't take a huge hit on his retirement because of shipping steel overseas either!  Give me a break!  Just like sending illegals back so they come back the right way will cost SO MUCH!  How much of my tax money is spent giving them free handouts?!?!  All a sham.  Trump knows it and says it!  Will any of this be easy?  NO - but it IS what needs to happen!  Communities can take care of their own (look at Wounded Warriors etc!).  We don't need Government doing everything for us.  Just like the market went through a correction - Government finally needs to go through one - a BIG ONE!  Trump is it and he will be the most scrutinized President ever - but I believe he says what he means and he means what he says.  I believe that he won't come out hoodwinking and bobble-heading to the American People.  He'll tell it like it is - good or bad!  Take a chance - with all we've lost, can it really get WORSE?!?  It will if we don't make a change in that booth next year!!!!

445098
Can human nature change?  No   Can nations (or civilizations) improve?  A resounding yes!!   We humans for evolutionary reasons need our anger to arouse us to action against a perceived threat to our survival.  We need our petty jealousies and meanness to navigate the social pecking order, to gain power.  The higher an individual is on the pecking order, the more likely he or she is to pass on her genes.  And acting in conjunction with other human beings we form groups (and eventually nations) to enhance our survival.  Those nations and civilizations have enabled us to improve our general treatment of individuals through laws, government, improvements in health, education, technological/industrial advances.  Thus, we improve the life of the tribe; however, we as individual tribal members still live our lives in a swirl of "negative" impulses and emotions much of the time (with a lot of individual variability).  No change or improvement is possible there since those negative impulses are necessary for living amongst our fellows.

Where are the safe golf Arab countries who spend billions of dollars on extravagance? How come they don't take on some of the responsibility for these refugees from war torn Syria and Yemen given that they are major players in the wars aflicting these countries directly or covertly. Europe has done more than its fair share. It is a shame that rich Arab countries are turning a blind eyes to the human catastrophe and devastation that is taking place as we speak. SHAME!!!!!

Really? According to military experts data, Russia has pumped the region with weapons, heavy artillery and tanks in the amount that surpasses armies of many European states.

 Do you think Putin is insisting on changes to the Ukrainian constitution because he wants regular people to have more say, to have more democracy? Look at his own country!

So what ever happened to "State's Rights" that Republicans are constantly railing about and are so passionate about? <br/><br/>Alaska has wanted the name changed back to Denali since 1975 BUT they were stopped by Ohioans in Congress. <br/><br/>Guess "State's Rights" is convenient when you want it to support your position BUT not when you don't want to allow a state the right to name it's own natural landmarks.<br/><br/>Both of Alaska Republican Senators and their Republican Congressman want the name changed back to Denali.  <br/><br/>Let the State and People of Alaska decide what to name their natural landmarks!  <br/><br/>Outsiders should keep their mouths shut!

Why he doesn't talk about the $250,000,000 that he owe to Chase Bank? Why he doesn't say that he is in bankruptcy. This guy is out of his mind ( if any ) How is he going to deport 11,000,000+ of illegal immigrants? Who is going to work on the fields 12+ hours picking strawberries, tomatoes etc etc, what kind of American is going to do that job??? he's just stupid!
