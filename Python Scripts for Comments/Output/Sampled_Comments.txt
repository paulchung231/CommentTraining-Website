"His "experience" included having a great deal of power over the careers of other people. His personal biases don't just affect him, but may have had a significant, real-world effect on many women's careers over the years. <br/><br/>As far as "bullying" goes, who knows if he "bullied" or harassed women in his lab whom he was romantically interested in? (You know, all those distracting women he was in love with?) <br/><br/>His attitude isn't just a quaint relic from days gone by. Many women in STEM are *still* dealing with the same kinds of bias and stereotyping. The fact that the university actually took action sends a strong signal-- that women are welcome in STEM, and that discrimination and bias there will actually be addressed (and not just swept under the rug, as in years past)." - I copied this from SD in Rochester because it was well said.

@Bohemienne: you do not understand how SS was designed. For one thing, it was invented in the 30s, when nearly every adult was married with children. And when households had ONE worker and one stay-at-home spouse (almost always the woman). So it was designed to provide retirement income for that non-working spouse, whose contribution was raising American citizens and workers.<br/><br/>It has worked well for 75 years, and kept tens of millions of widowed homemakers from abject poverty.<br/><br/>Now -- modern lefty liberalism and feminism has upended a lot of this (but not all by any means). But the system still WORKS. Why? because the worker you mentioned is really paying in for TWO PEOPLE -- the worker and his spouse -- EVEN IF there is no spouse (as in your case).<br/><br/>So the singleton pays the rate for a married couple and only takes out ONE SS check in retirement -- this supports the system as a whole.<br/><br/>Even better: you may be single TODAY, but you might get married tomorrow. If you do, the system AUTOMATICALLY FLEXES to pay your spouse that $500 a month -- even if you marry them at age 85 (and even if they are only 40, and out live you by 50 years!).<br/><br/>So yes, it makes perfect absolute sense. If you CHOOSE not to marry, you are CHOOSING to give up that $500 income for a potential spouse. That is YOUR CHOICE, and you change your mind at any time.

Completely agree Paul.  Trump is just pushing the buttons placed there by the Republican party over decades.

No one had heard of Seal Team 6, till Obama "outed" them in his announcement telling us that  Bin Laden had been killed.  He was grandstanding and did not need to do that.  It setSeal Team 6 in the Taliban's crosshairs, hence the helicopter that was shot down shortly after.   NYT, I am not pleased to see so much detail here, either Mistakes will be made, but they are an honorable group.  I am so grateful to this unit and the Army's counterpart of it.

Bill Cunningham | Daytime Goddesses<br/>By SOFIA PERPETUA | Jul. 31, 2015<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/fashion/100000003830954/bill-cunningham-day-time-goddesses.html?playlistId=1247463985977" title="http://www.nytimes.com/video/fashion/100000003830954/bill-cunningham-day-time-goddesses.html?playlistId=1247463985977" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/video/fashion/100000003830954/bill-cunningham-day...</a><br/><br/>Fashion is something extraordinarily odd. No matter what the occasion is, we want to look our best, showing off our style, and own it! New styles are popping from every corner of every block in the Big Apple. NYC feels like ATL. It is high in the 90's, but we still keep it rocking. Just because it is hot, it doesn't mean you should give up style. It is like just because you don't know how to do it, it doesn't mean you quit. It is always hot in Atlanta. Even in the high 90's, I still wear my thick long sleeve Oxford style shirt with colorful pants to match it. I may be dying inside, but I look great.<br/>The streets of New York City are always so festive and fun. It is because its one of the biggest upbeat fashion cities in the world! Bill Cunningham calling her a "Daytime Goddess" is unquestionable. The simplicity of her look is utterly exquisite. The classic bun, the purse, and the shoes are perfectly paired.<br/> Bill Cunningham has really outdone himself. These candid photos capture the essence of New York City. From the pop of color of the guys pants to the shimmering shine of the sandals, the styles are endless. Seeing the New Yorkers from block to block is what makes the iconic New York City the NYC.

The Chinese leadership must maintain national stability, employment and keep most Chinese happy. One of the ways is devaluating the currency, which consequently is boosting exports and sustains employment. The west will keep buying lower cost Chinese products while China would be able to employ more of 2015 huge number of university graduates (about 7.5 million!!!). In parallel and in addition to the smart Chinese artificial trade barriers for Western products, the tight control on imports coupled with currency devaluation works well for the Chinese domestic economy. The West keeps the doors open to Chinese goods, the Chinese narrow again their door for foreign imports.

Unfounded presumption of discriminatory practices? The first thing these states did after the court ruled was to reinstitute those discriminatory practices.

Why would we want to curb it in adults? If it's interfering with your life, sure, but I use my computer and phone precisely to the extent I want to. In most cases, the new media simply replace the old -- email rather than snail mail, read the paper online, use Google Calendar rather than an address book, Kindle books rather than paperbacks, etc.<br/><br/>I have the sense that some older people see younger people buried in their phones and think they're up to something nefarious because they don't understand how much fits under that little hood.

Jindal was referring to Republican candidates who damaged their chances with comments on rape and abortion.<br/><br/>Jindal said "We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments"<br/><br/>One must not give too much credit to Jindal for his observation as he was referring to Republican messaging errors and was not questioning Republican policy on Iraq, Israel, torture, tax cuts for the wealthy.<br/><br/>It is more that Jindal argued Republicans are campaigning stupidly.

The endgame will be painful for the citizens of Greece - regardless of whether a majority vote "No" or "Yes" this weekend.  Since Tsipras and Varoufakis realize that bluffing with Germany is not going to be effective, they are getting ready to blame the outside creditors for all suffering of the Greek people.    <br/><br/>Although blaming foreign enemies is a rational political strategy for Tsipras, I wonder how long Greek citizens will support the government as a bank panic ensues with increasingly strict controls on bank withdrawals.  I'm sure Tsipras is getting ready to repeat the "it's Germany's fault" line on television if Greece is ejected from the euro-zone.  But how long will that work?  Stay tuned!

It is well understood, by the EU nomenclature, that elected Governments are supposed to pretend they look after their people’s interests. They must look Serious and Adult as they explain that ‘There Is No Alternative” to the failed Austerity ideology – even though their own briefing documents say otherwise. The members of the Nomenclature must always make sure to play the game and in particular must not describe Austerity as [Financial] terrorism and not engage in amateur activities like living up to their peoples' interests. No, their responsibilities are to the EU Nomenclature. If the Greek Prime Minister had accepted the Troika ultimatum, and condemned Greece to endless depression he would be lionised as a Statesman by the Nomenclature and their friends in the media.<br/>Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, is a true statesman. It is clear from his blog on his resignation, that he knows his truth telling will become the issue and that the hurt feelings of a few Bureaucrats will take precedence over the good of the Greek people and the good of the European Union.

What about abortions that are performed when the baby could live outside the mother?<br/><br/>Many premature babies, with care, live outside the mother.<br/><br/>Why is it acceptable to kill another human being because it is inconvenient or will be a burden to care for?

Do We Still Need Libraries?<br/>As years pass, people prefer books, magazines, and news off the internet. Most people no longer have a use to go to the library to find books, to study, or to research, and for that libraries have fewer reasons to exist. Whether you still use the public library, use today's technology as your root of knowledge, or both, libraries are needed. When today's adults were younger their experience with reading was not a tablet in their hand, rather going to the local library clasping anything that had interested them. Growing up, they would stay there to study and research where they found comfort in silence rather than having a laptop with the information at the fingertips,that is also a source of distraction. Most libraries in large cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia are more in need for money, but aren't provided with the money they call for,and for that their funds are from the public. Public libraries provide numerous genres of books and novels for nothing. Especially, in large cities when there are people of various ethnic origins, religions, and economic statuses, it's open for everyone. Even though libraries have books and novels that can also be found on the internet, not everyone uses the newest devices. As new generations come, more technology is released, and most of the older generations do not turn to use these devices. The public libraries are able to still provide a certain satisfaction and comfort compared to a tablet.

I recommend "The Police Tapes", a documentary film from 1976.  It offers  insight into the world of police interaction with mostly minority citizens in South Bronx.  And the motivations for bad behavior on both sides.

I recently heard a sobering conversation.  A friend was doing family research and thought that one woman from the past in particular was quite interesting and said to the woman's son -- who is a man in his late 70's --"I wish I'd known your mother" and his reply was "I wish I'd known her too, she died when I was three from an abortion."  Obviously it happened many years ago, when abortion was illegal and in this case, the woman's sister attempted to abort the fetus -- the result was a ruptured uterus, infection and death for the woman and a three year old and his sister left with no mother who fortunately found a substitute in their grandmother with the help of their grandfather and father.<br/>Is this what we want?    I guess this is what Republicans want.  Of course, they only want it for poor women because wealthy women will always have the ability to have safe abortions, just as those women will always have access to the best healthcare.<br/>There is one word for Republicans -- despicable.

27
This exact quote: ”The State House is different, and the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way.” appropriately includes a backward open quotation mark. <br/><br/>What the Governor was inferring, by, "the State House is different," is, as she stated; that it's still fine and dandy to fly that flag on your own property. She hands the racists an out on a silver platter, a completely unnecessary kowtow.<br/><br/>This paper makes her out to be a forward thinking politician of progressive ideals, when in fact she is just a panderer, in this case to both sides.

An immensely sad episode in human history - Christians endured every sort of travail for 2,000 years but the end is nigh.<br/>This country doesn't take it very well when asked for self-reflection whether it's the Trail of Tears, Hiroshima, Vietnam, the destabilization of Cambodia that gave us the Khmer Rouge.<br/>I hope this deficit of self-reflection will not blind us once again from identifying the Bush/Cheney delusional scheme that was the Second Iraq War as the source of the catastrophe for the Christians of the region. I hope it will cause reflection as well on the influential talking heads who are thrashing the Nuclear Agreements with Iran and instead are salivating for another war in the Gulf.

Harry Reid retiring should help.

After watching the debate last night, I thought we were so fortunate to have a president we can be proud of who is cerebral, thoughtful, enlightened, and who is respected by the people around the world. The mere thought that he may be replaced  in less than two years  by one of the Republicans on the stage last night is enough to give many of us nightmares.

Apparently, l threw the dice when the rent stabilization increase offered for my apartment (in September 2014) were 1 percent increase for one-year lease and 2.75 percent increase for a two-year lease. I opted for a two-year lease, thinking (faultily it turns out) that I would be spared an even greater increase in 2015 when a one-year lease would expire.  Now I see that I was sucker-punched at worst or tricked at best. Why doesn't The Board vote to roll back the increases gotten for all two year rent stabilized leases signed last year? <br/><br/>I get no benefit from signing a two-year lease in September 2014, but I give my landlord a gift that is totally undeserved, especially since not only have no new improvements been made in my apartment or in my building during the interim, but I am treated to the  daily dirt, dust and noise pollution arising from the extensive renovation work now being done on two recently vacated apartments on my floor. When completed, these renovations will bring my landlord huge rent increases and provide a means for accelerating them to market rates. To be fair, The Board should roll back to zero any increases that take effect in 2015 that were granted for a 2-year rent stabilization lease signed after September 2014!

Mr. Fishman brags about California's ever-growing population as if that is a good thing.  Our urban areas continue to metastasize, our Mediterranean woodlands are converted into vineyards, the entire southern Sacramento Valley has been turned into a desert by industrial agriculture, and the population continues to expand from uncontrolled illegal immigration.  This is not a formula for long term success.

When I was a young teenager I helped a friend deliver newspapers in the poor segregated neighborhood where he lived.  I became curious when I saw him put most of his payment collection deep into his socks, and keep a small portion in his pocket.  The ritual's purpose soon became apparent.  We were accosted by a neighborhood gang, and my friend was forced to give them what he had kept in his pants.  I didn't have any.  I always thought he had saved me from being roughed up.<br/><br/>It taught me the dark side of living in segregated poorer enclaves.  In retrospect was I also suppose to report the crime to the police?  My youth may be my main excuse since I had no sense of such a responsibility at that age.<br/><br/> Before critics jump to conclusions about Ms. Goffman's work, they should realize they weren't there.  If they have a concern,let them go and interview those who were there at the time.  They may learn what passes for routine when people are huddled together, and are poor, angry, and hopeless.<br/><br/>I believe Ms. Goffman took the risks she did because she had hypothesized that enforcement of laws was not going to solve the social problems she was studying.

Since 9/11, as many of us in the real world now understand, cops around the country have morphed from what someone else here trenchantly described as the post-WWII, mid and late-20th century "Guardian Mindset" to the far more belligerent and trigger-happy "Warrior Mindset" one might find among a Marine company on the front lines in Afghanistan.  "Corporal" Casebolt, after all, not simply Officer Casebolt. This guy acted like he was casing a mud hut in Anbar province filled with possible civilian combatants, rather than a bunch of swimsuit-clad teens at a suburban community pool in Texas.  Just really nuts!  When he pulled his weapon, I thought, "completely out of control", the exact opposite of what a beat cop is supposed to be, especially in the eyes of kids.  Some if not most of them may never look at cops again with anything but instant fear, and certainly not respect.  Is this what law enforcement prefers around the country: A population of terrified, resentfully compliant, seething young people, many of whom have easy access to guns and simply hate cops?

Word Count:260<br/>“No longer may this liberty be denied,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority in the historic decision. Today, June twenty-sixth, twenty fifteen, a law was passed by the supreme court stating that same-sex marriage is now legal in all fifty states of America. Therefore, any state that has made gay marriage illegal, they will be forced to change the law. Author Adam Liptak quoted Chief Justice Roberts in the article when stating “If you are among the many Americans - of whatever sexual orientation - who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decisions, celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.” I believe this quote is true, I liked how the author included it because it is telling every person in America to celebrate what they were given today and be grateful that the supreme court tried hard to support same-sex people. I enjoyed reading this article because I am a supporter of same-sex marriage. I think that people should be able to express themselves and not be told who they should marry. I’m glad it became legal today and I am sure it made many people across America overjoyed to find out they can live their lives in peace and happy.

This is playing out about like the end game will for Puerto Rico and Illinois.<br/><br/>Once you get a population addicted to entitlements and rich pensions, they will choose a path of self destruction over steps to restore solvency -- and will feel righteously indignant doing it. You can read some of the comments on this thread and feel the passion in defending the indefensible, in deflecting blame onto "corporatists" and "banksters" and others who had nothing to do with the steady increase in self promises.<br/><br/>De Toqueville called it spot on when he said a long time ago:<br/><br/>"The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers they can bribe the public with the public's money." As it happens, it's even easier to do the bribing with borrowed Chinese money.

46
This is pretty much standard industry wide approach to the health problems caused by their products.  First you deny and then you lie, invent doubt through paid off scientists; block legislation through paid off politicians; and eventually, when you have stalled as long as you can and as many millions of people have been harmed as you can cause, finally you make legal settlement that makes the government your partner through higher taxes on your product that assures your continued existence and the continued damage you are doing.<br/><br/>Note that even after massive settlements (paid for by the users) the tobacco industry is alive and making billions even as they continue to kill and harm millions and as the pay of governments with billions in taxes that don't cost them a cent.

Will a hacker-terrorist access that oil-drilling platform and blow it up? The Internet was designed to be an open platform used by a fairly limited number of academics, scientists, etc. working in a limited number of university, government and corporate settings, Few foresaw the Nets expansion to virtually anyone located anywhere for personal and crass commercial purposes. . Bulletproof security was never a consideration. Until it is, the Internet of things is likely to impose more danger and cost than benefits.

I can't think of a better example of when the death penalty is appropriate.  The reason is not to deter future murders.  The reason is punishment, retribution (justice) and to make a statement (judgment) as a society against this abhorrent behavior.

On the one hand there are articles like this one, blaming the parents for not policing what their kids eat, even when they cook healthy meals. On the other hand there are studies showing how parental and societal pressure on vulnerable tweens and teens contributes to disordered eating. I have fraternal twin sons who are tweens. One is 50 pounds heavier than the other. One eats like a sparrow, the other like a full-grown football player. Harping the latter's weight brings him to tears. I rather he be a bit heavy but happy with his body and not fall into depression or anorexia/bulemia.

So why hasn't Obama adopted Biden's 3-state plan?  Biden is still the Vice President, and if Biden can't get his 3-state plan implemented, then who can?

When asked Trump said If he didn't get the nomination would he run as a Independent. This is what Trump does best. He holds the leverage and he uses it. This is the guy who I want dealing with Russian, Iran, China, Mexico. He has a brilliant strategy and I think it's who he will pick as a running mate.

Feinstein should retire. I heard her speak recently on the CIA and the domestic surveillance program. I was utterly disappointed in her naiveté and uncritical acceptance of the assurances she received that yes, terrorist plots had been foiled and no, the program was not abused in any way to spy on Americans and suck up their data. I don't care if it's NSA/CIA/FBI/Homeland Security - spying is spying when you talk about it. She seemed intellectually, not up to speed. Or dishonest. Either way - thank you for your service, but it's time to go!

55
Yes, Great article Charles.  It seems that a "uniform" cult has grown in the USA and spreading to other places, like in Canada.  Wear a uniform, and you are somehow above others and in the case of police, have a licence to kill.  As another article headline notes, police abuse is another form of terrorism - and it is sanctioned by the state as it is rare that the police officer is ever charged with murder and most often does not even seem to be subject to discipline other than "lie low for a bit".  Even here in Canada, police are being outfitted with Military gear.  For decades police cars were painted white and lighter colours, with "Community Service" or some such decal on the vehicle.  Now they are going back to Black and White with the cars looking like mini-tanks. The soft approach, which accompanied dramatically falling crime rates , now replace with the hard, tough look and the personnel inside, decked out like some storm trooper with all their weapons and gadgets bedecking their costumes.<br/>It is long past time to take a serious look at policing in our countries and especially the training and qualification of the offices who are hired to "defend" and "protect" us citizens, white and black alike - not terrorize and kill us. 

56
It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone to learn that we are probing their cyber defenses too. I hope we do, and I'm glad we do. The point is to understand that notwithstanding all the handshaking and smiles for the cameras when our leaders meet, China is at best our strategic rival and at worst our enemy.

57
BHO will be regarded as the most transformational president since LBJ, and maybe even since FDR. Even Reagan and Eisenhower, for all their electoral success, only applied the brakes to the progress of the country and did not really change its direction.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mister President.

Max Planck said it best: Science progresses funeral by funeral, or literally: "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."

China has shown over and over again that its rapidly built, poorly planned infrastructure is prone to horrific accidents and other unintended consequences. This is true of railroads, dams, factories and other installations. What makes you think nuclear power plants thrown up in haste by the Chinese -- and make no mistake, that's what's happening -- will be safe? Was Chernobyl safe? 

60
Replace the word "women" with "men" and vice versa in this article.  One can observe that the scientists and the writer of this article view the world through a prism of misandry.  For example, replace the word men with women in this quote "So for the planet’s sake, men should “stop complaining,” Dr. Kingma said." It would be absolutely unacceptable, and rightly so, to say that about women in any regards; people are more than just a group they identify with, they are individuals.  Is there hard science behind this idea? Absolutely, but these researchers and the writer of this article need to know that the office thermometer isn't a grand conspiracy by men to walk over women; I was born in the late 80s, many years after this formula was set (the 1960s), and have to hold any power over anyone in a professional setting.  Furthermore, they don't mention in this article breaking down the rigid gender norms that males have to adhere too.  We don't wear heavy and warm suits with ties and shirts because we want to per say, we do because we have to.  In many office settings, including mine (medicine), there are strict dress codes that mandate males have to wear these items or they risk formal punishment. 

61
Without much attention from the American government or the media, the nation directly to the south of the United States is sliding toward chaos. Now journalists are being murdered in the capital, and drug lords and corrupt politicians are turning large swaths of Mexico into zones of horrendous violence.<br/><br/>Vicious criminals are operating with impunity. Corruption is rampant. The Mexican government is either powerless or unwilling to do anything to change the situation. Friends who live there express strong fears for the future.<br/><br/>As we enter the silly season of the endless Presidential campaign, is anyone -- in government or the media -- taking any initiatives to deal with or reveal the depths of the problem?<br/><br/>Or do we intend to wait until we have a failed state at our southern border, one created in part by American policies, from NAFTA's destruction of Mexico's small farm economy to the completely-counterproductive "war on drugs?"<br/><br/>Perhaps we will finally pay attention when thousands of frightened, desperate people start flooding into California, Arizona and Texas, because their homeland is unfit for human life.<br/><br/>But by then it will be too late. 

62
Jonathan, you make a good point. I agree and counter with, why not try both responses - reducing very human error and communicating in a more effective way.<br/><br/>Physicians have a difficult career and can be unappreciated. The stress can be challenging.<br/><br/>My viewpoint is the leadership is the answer, somehow finding ways to support physicians and reasonable, logical patient needs, tangible and intangible.

63
Instead of merely talking about, why don't we actually do something. First ban the worldwide burni g of coal and Second, demand that Obama sign the 20 something Natural Gas Export licenses sitting on his desk. In the US we have proven that cheap Natural Gas is the answer to reducing carbon so there is no excuse for anymore delay.

David,<br/><br/>As I am sure you know, the worlds glaciers and sea ice were lesser prior to the globally colder LIA:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/~yarrow/Young_et_al_2011_Geology.pdf" title="http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/~yarrow/Young_et_al_2011_Geology.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/~yarrow/Young_et_al_2011_Geology.pdf</a><br/><br/>Kreutz et al. (1997) compared results from studies of West Antarctic ice cores with the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) and suggested a synchronous global Little Ice Age.[46] An ocean sediment core from the eastern Bransfield Basin in the Antarctic Peninsula shows centennial events that the authors link to the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period.[47] The authors note "other unexplained climatic events comparable in duration and amplitude to the LIA and MWP events also appear."<br/>CO2 mixing ratios at Law Dome<br/><br/>The Siple Dome (SD) has a climate event with an onset time that is coincident with that of the LIA in the North Atlantic based on a correlation with the GISP2 record. This event is the most dramatic climate event seen in the SD Holocene glaciochemical record.[48] The Siple Dome ice core also contained its highest rate of melt layers (up to 8%) between 1550 and 1700, most likely because of warm summers during the LIA.[49]<br/><br/>Law Dome ice cores show lower levels of CO2 mixing ratios during 1550–1800 AD, leading investigators Etheridge and Steele to conjecture "probably as a result of colder global climate."[50]<br/><br/>From Wiki.<br/><br/>These vast changes were not human forced, nor were the much warmer prior periods before the LIA (2-3C warmer globally).

Neither morality nor wealth can be legislated.  We gave up trying to do the former but have spent in excess of $20 trillion trying to do the latter since the mid-sixties.  The package of government transfer payments available today varies by state by ranges up to the equivalent of a job paying $40,000 per year.  The argument that all we need to do is take a little more from "the rich" (n.b., the definition of rich is anyone who makes more than the person using the term) is patently illogical.  Our government is already funded by the top 10% of the population (who pay 70% of the taxes), and we're spending $400-500 billion more than we take in (despite record-high government revenues).  Equality before the law is of utmost importance.  Equality of income is inconsequential and, more important, disastrous.

I had a close friend that worked in the industry for sometime. She was bullied and threatened by a "friend"..She attempted suicide twice and ended up in a mental facility diagnosed with depression, panic attack and paranoid schizophrenia. How can you harm someone that's already doing self harm? Everytime she opened the door she said she was afraid. Meanwhile I met other girls in the industry too and all that I know is they were doing nothing more than pay their bills even the "high class" ones, you name it.. Paying for their kids in high school, helping their families and taking care of themselves. I've never seen a rich escort in my life.. Unless you go to the real models that's where the cash really goes and the courtines are definitely closed.

The families of the slain must be among the most saintly people alive. Which only makes the murders more heinous. For those we lost that day must also have been blessings upon our society.

I, too, hope the ability of wealthy Republicans to write the narrative for the rest of us is over, but I'm pretty sure it is not.  <br/><br/>Just look to Wisconsin, Kansas and Florida, where three of the worst Republican governors were all re-elected to second terms, despite the damage they have done to everyone but the 1 %-ers in their states.<br/><br/>American voters continue to be willfully, proudly ignorant, and so they continue to believe Republican lies, and to vote against their own self-interest--and yours and mine while they are at it!

Hats off to the pope for tackling climate change.  Perhaps he will next sanction birth control and abortion as a way to keep the population of the world at bay, one of the reasons for so much worldly turmoil.  We will see if he has more power/cred then the oil companies, coal companies, major corporations and capitalists in general.  Greed is a powerful motivator to ignore others.

You know, a person might be troubled by the possible breaking of the law or risking of national security by using a DIY email server to handle top security info from the State Dept.<br/><br/>But looks like most are just concerned about the "bad publicity" that has been kicked up by that pesky "email scandal".<br/><br/>Hillary might start getting a little bit more concerned about how many people have gone to jail, been fired or had their government security clearances revoked over much less.

Dr. John - Check out sites like the one for The Innocence Project, not everyone on death row or who has been executed was guilty.

What are the facts? Tell me them - you are so convinced because alleged unbiased scientist told you so. Anyone who questions the settle science is a sheep.  There are probably hundreds of settled science episodes that were unproven. Every time you see climate changed mentioned, it goes on and on about the effects.  Seas rising, drought, storms, etc, etc. You rarely see articles anymore showing humans as the cause. Why don't you just admit what climate change is - a vast left wing conspiracy.

Europe's real problem is Angela Merkel and her country's policy dominance over the rest of the continent. For as long as European leaders continue to run their economic policies in a way that is individual country-centric, those policies will doom the weakest among the Euro nations and weaken the rest, as it has.<br/><br/>The Euro union was predicated around the notion that the individual parts would all work for the group, as a group. While some may have, not all did - Germany certainly did not, and its policy diktats have subverted the original intent.<br/><br/>Our American parallel would be the way the GOP, over time, more so over the last six years, has undermined our democratic process to almost completely subvert the function of our government at the national level and in the states where it controls all government. In our nation the group for which the economy works is the .01%. Real unemployment is still at 11% overall, and way higher in specific cross-sections of our society.<br/><br/>When you belong to a group, you have to take the entire group's needs into account when you set local policy. It didn't happen and now the people of Greece, Spain, Finland, and others whose economies were never dominant are paying the price for German selfishness.<br/><br/>I hope the Greek people show some spine and support their current government. I hope that gives courage for the others to follow suit in challenging Germany's diktats. <br/><br/>Voters need to regain control and defeat neoconservatism and neoliberalism.

77
Unfortunately for Obama, many of us have experienced the effects of NAFTA.  <br/><br/>Elizabeth Warren issued a report comparing the rhetoric and the reality of trade bills of the last several decades and without exception the promises and hopes have not been achieved.  Child labor has increased, murders of labor activists have increased, wages have declined, etc.  Anyone reading Warren's recent report would not be persuaded by Obama's soaring rhetoric.  Even Nancy Pelosi did not support the trade bill.  <br/><br/>Talk is cheap.  Rhetoric doesn't get it any more.  Actions speak louder than words.  The actions resulting from the trade bills over the last several decades have been insults to our intelligence, our way of life and our values.  As Bernie would say, enough is enough.

Reductio ad absurdum.  <br/><br/>No one is proposing that everyone should receive the same income regardless of skills, talents and drive.  But we are in a situation where top executives are paid several hundred times more than average workers, and several thousand times more than those at the bottom of the list.  That is insane; nobody's skills, talents and drive are that special.

Immigration reform is about a 'bigger cheaper labor pool'.  I can understand why businesses want this, but why do the Democrats want it as well?

I was about 60 percent on that category Jimbo, but slapped myself for everyone I didn't get. <br/><br/>I did get final Jeopardy (or guessed correctly). I had a feeling it was Little House but only remembered the author's name thanks to DL.

Concerned,<br/><br/>Some of my ancestors were abolitionists. One of them served in reconstruction as a major general. I've worked down south a few times. From what I've heard, while I was there, I wondered if some people actually got it --- the war between the states is over --- you lost! <br/><br/>Lincoln underestimated the vigor of the Southern cause in 1865. He forgot about the lunatic fringe, like Gordon and Forrest. Lee, and others had had enough. Most soldiers wanted to go home. The agitators started this delusion called the "Lost Cause;" it was portrayed in "Gone with the Wind." <br/><br/>A lot of bad things happen between good presidents. Truman followed after FDR making all the wrong moves after WWII and Johnston, a southerner, did the same after the civil war. Johnston should have tried these agitators for treason, they'd sworn allegiance to the Union. This problem was allowed to fester. And, now, I hope it's over.

Honoring the native population is a mixed bag.  Re-naming a mountain is one thing.  Authorizing whale hunts is another.  As always, the support of native populations ends where their practices are offensive to our 21st century sensibilities.

Americans are so accustomed to referring to women with respect that the politically correct mishmash of last-names-only just isn't good enough for public use, and the first name usage is an attempt to be more Real, traditional, and respectful.

we are our biggest enemy. we start things we can't finish; we're the world's number one arms dealer and it bites us back; we create new enemies in an attempt to end existing ones; we don't learn from history. And while it's an outdated word, the military-industrial complex keeps us at war all the time. It was never more obvious than when we we fooled into going after Hussein, who was no angel but at least fostered stability in the region.

Lincoln Chafee has never been elected to any office as a Democrat. His last campaign was as an independent running for Governor of Rhode Island in 2010. He won - with 36% of the vote. Two out of three Rhode Isanders didn't want him.<br/>Not the stuff of a serious Democratic Presidential candidate.

88
Yes, duty, that all but forgotten, derided idea.  If we all just did our duty, we'd be a lot happier and the world would operate a whole lot better.  <br/><br/>All this feel-good and "find your passion" philosophy is hogwash.  Do what needs to be done and do it as well as possible.  "Don't sweat the details"?  Really?  It's the details that will trip us up every single time - it's ALL in the details!<br/><br/>Having just spent a week trying to get a prescription refilled, including my doctor spending an hour of his time in the evening, also attempting it, I can't help but think that if we did a better job at our duties and the details it would be a far better world.

Anyone who's visited cities in China realizes that this "ban" is pure Western mimicry and can't be enforced in practical terms.  China loves its tobacco, not unlike the U.S. fifty years ago.<br/><br/>But I'd much rather that they first invest their regulatory energies in stopping their factories from smoking (and belching toxins).  It's literally killing China, perhaps far more dangerously than tobacco.

I've watched all manner of video data on various aspects of the problems in Ukraine. There is no question that Russian speaking Ukrainians do not want to be under the thumb of anti-Russia Kiev pols, who for the record installed themselves in a violent coup.<br/><br/>This video says it all in a short piece, Ukrainian woman takes the mic &amp; tells off a recruiter from Kiev, in front of a large crowd applauding spontaneously.

Let us not forget the state and city where Katrina's impact was felt in the worst way.  The then mayor of that city is currently serving a 10 year sentence for corruption.  Odd how the other states fared so much better and things ran smoother.  When there is a lack of strong infrastructure and able bureaucracy it's easy to see how things go terribly wrong...if you choose to open your eyes.  Of course Obama has had no 'Katrina', he has the cartel of large media boys running interference for him.  I have no doubt that if Iran ever makes use of a nuclear weapon, those of us left will be reading and watching how it all stemmed from the Bush administration's decisions (most likely the 'true' roots will be traced by the media all the way back to Reagan).

Europe is in trouble.  How many terrorists are on these boats loaded with fleeing Middle Easters from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya now landing in Greece and Italy.  How many more next year.  Europe's population density is almost 5 times that of the US - they have their work cut for them.

94
Certainly not Barack Obama. He and his inner circle of Incompetents have managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on a scale not seen in American History!<br/><br/>No amount of creative Liberal spinning will change this fact. He has been measured, weighed and found sorely wanting.

Thanks for the mention of Project Wombat.  I've gone to the site and intend to investigate further.<br/><br/>I was for many years a constant user of the NYPL telephone information service to get those odd bits of information that I just had to have--either for professional reasons or just so my mind didn't obsess about something.  The idea of an online version is very welcome.

Middleman, the political expediency to the right wing terrorists in this country's elite is why the<br/>Cubans get "asylum."  After which they get propped<br/>Up<br/>And say, "look at these<br/>Great<br/>Capitalists who thrive in the<br/>Wall Street capitalist system."  The CIA was installing these vagrants on businesses after 1959 to that end.

Megan Kelly brought her own personal agenda to the debate which she never should have been allowed to moderate in the first place. IF MK is going through a life changing experience, which I think she is , and is in the vicinity of becoming a militant feminist, that's her own affair.Its fairly obvious to me and no doubt to other viewers that she absolutely wanted to be the star of the show, and the presidential candidates were merely "comparses(extras) in the spectacle starring herself. My hunch is. and I believe that I am seldom wrong, is Mk is inching her way towards another lifestyle, and her hostility towards the candidates, all men, on the stage is a manifestation of this.Instead of asking DT about jobs and economics, which are his specialties, she tried to put him on the defensive by bringing up certain of his tweets.Both RM and RA who stage managed the whole thing r tiptoeing on the thin edge of 80, and their careers may have lived. Time for new, intelligent leadership at Fox,which might begin by giving MK the old heave ho, and recommending her to MSNBC where she belongs.

Well if only things were that simple. If Greece leaves the euro zone, other countries might follow. Greece's exit will serve as an unwanted precedent and destroy EU's unity. What is more, euro zone membership is supposed to be one-way. You don't join it when time is good and leave it when things go bad. More importantly: Unlike Greece, other 9 EU countries didn't adopt the euro from the beginning.

How can we possibly have this discussion without calling out the real and continuing disaster--lack of fiscal stimulus?  While the Fed might choke off a weak recovery if it raises rates 25 bp, we have that weak economy because Congress refuses to invest in our country and because so many of its members believe reducing debt and starving the government is the most critical action they can take today.

Judges are also products of their societies and schools. Those schools and societies are of an earlier generation than the young accused or young prosecutors. Death may be the great leveler in the end. (At the Pearly Gates, the Angels sing: Here comes the judge...)

Greece is an example of what happens when the very rich are allowed to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.<br/><br/>Many others, to avoid being burdened by excessive taxes, seek their own income producing/tax avoidance scam: excessively generous pensions, off-the-books economy.<br/><br/>Greece today is the USA of the future.

All I can say if Al Gore had been president and Jeb had not gotten his brother into office we would not have gone to Iraq and Afghanistan just because of his brother's ego to prove his father and brother (Jeb) wrong and now he wants the office...can we please stop the Bush dynasty, have they not ruined this country enough?  Let  us not forget the Bush administration's not admitting there is global warming and that we need to do something about it...Now we are fracking...again how different it would be if the Bush Dynasty had not come down to one Governor getting his brother into office...give us a break.  The Republicans will try to blame this on the Obama administration, but check to see how much of the issues Obama had were actually started in the Bush Administration?

You won't get an argument from me about eliminating the VPs. At my university, the number of adminstrators has gone up by close to 50% while the number of faculty members and staff has gone down by almost the same amount. However, I do believe you are wrong about the majority of professors. It may be true that you would see my colleagues or I shopping in the middle of the day or having classes on only three days a week; in fact, I have classes only two days a week. However, to think that is an indicator is to truly not understand the nature of the work. With the time it takes to prep for a good class, grading, committees, department meetings, advising 25 graduate students, providing service to the profession through reviews and work for conferences, doing public service work, and my own required research, writing and publishing, I work between 60 - 100 hours in the average week. The fact that you don't happen to see me when I'm sitting at my computer writing at 2 am doesn't mean its not happening.

Mr. King can eat a good dose of crow today, having been willing to jeopardize comprehensive, guaranteed, affordable insurance for millions of Americans, all because he finds President Obama "a narcissist" and also since he had his own coverage through the VA.  A healthy serving coming up, plaintiff.

The Times has, over the years, presented plenty of in-depth reporting on the growing Russian authoritarianism, or at least as much as is possible on a country with increasingly tight restrictions on foreign correspondents.  And the Times' reporting on U.S. foreign policy is frequently highly critical, especially in the "news analysis" pieces and the the op-ed section.  The American press, including the Times, hurls a daily barrage of stones at "our own house."  Does Russia's?

Here are two, admittedly small, prophylactic measure:  <br/><br/>(1)  No traffic stops for minor offenses.  If an officer sees what he thinks is a  problem, let him write down the license plate number and send a warning notice to the owner.  Maybe if an owner accumulated a certain number of notices (a fact that could be verified via computer, then a stop would be allowed.  <br/><br/>(2)  No shooting -- or even pursuit -- of drivers who take off after a traffic stop.  Let that be grounds for an arrest warrant that could be enforced next time.  <br/><br/>Neither of these measures addresses the underlying problems -- but they might reduce tension between police and citizens.

I agree.  10 years are a long time and a ton of money. Perhaps instead of helping her finding a man (among other things) he should have tried to teach her how to live without constant doctor if not even medical support.

It is bad enough that we treat prisoners more inhumanely than most<br/>Western nations, with little chance for redemption, and prison sentences<br/>frequently are in excess of the crime, but this is really too much. I read it with a mixture of horror and disbelief.  Just a few weeks ago, the NY Times ran a feature story on the positive conditions of German prisons, where the employees are screened and trained for work with the prisoners, who then come out with job skills and mainly do not return.  What a contrast with our prisons here, which need an overhaul top to bottom, starting with the people hired to work with prisoners...

116
Bridget, I am not sure that it is fair to blame the Republicans for Trump.  He doesn't represent either party - mostly he just represents his own egotistical, narcissistic self.

It is all our fault. We elected a first class nincompoop Mayor, who no sooner gets elected goes off to Italy with family, then moves in Gracie Mansion, installs higher fencing around, send his son off to, would'ya believe,  of all places YALE! He has done exactly what an upstart would do at the expense of ignoring and learning what his duties are as a Mayor. Now he is already ordering new wardrobe to meet the Pope, as if that will entitle him a free entry into the Heavenly Gates! Its all me, me, me. The sooner we boot him and his wife out, the better.

A lot of us "clients" don't like it.  Not at all.

The answer is, I am fairly certain, that Johnny as a non-Jew would at least escape an unpleasant fate and possibly even gain favor with the Nazi regime by BOTH divorcing AND denouncing his Jewish wife.  This might also expunge any potential liability for harboring her until October, 1944, a point when almost no Jews remained in Germany.  As for the inheritance, his status as her EX-husband was presumably why he stood to gain nothing from simply proving her dead, and had to concoct this scheme of her being alive and then illegally splitting the proceeds with her.

120
Engrained social pressure to have children is stronger in some cohorts than others. Men are made to think they need have children to prove their masculinity. The message to society should be that raising the child after impregnating someone is the measure of masculinity, not being an irresponsible sperm donor.

@dvepaul:  Well said; I can only add that I would recommend Mr. Greenfield re-visit the work of a gentleman and Reporter named Edward R. Murrow (I'm assuming he knows the name), and then re-address his comment to something such as "I don't dare to go on television and say, 'Senator X is a bald-faced liar'"  It's called ethics and truth in reporting - too many reporters and executives have forgotten the meaning of both.

"This is about money, money for the military contractors who make those "battle tanks" and Dog nose what else as we ramp up another bogus conflict (do we CARE what happens to Ukraine?? Let Germany worry about it!) to enrich our war profiteers."<br/><br/>Wow, and I thought Obama was Commander in Chief who decided how our military and hardware is deployed.

The Democrats have abandoned the President on this one.  It's the strange bedfellows of the Republicans and President Obama pushing this forward. The Republicans have given him the "fast track" to make this secret agreement and give away what NAFTA and the WTO Chinese agreement haven't already.

After retiring from my practice in Critical Care, I've been exploring and writing about end of life issues.

Arkansas, Hope AR, and especially the Baptist Church on Main St. should be ashamed of the comments of this native son about the President of the United States.  What demagoguery.  So embarrassing and sad.  What have we come to?

Maybe she's just clever enough to understand that these people are going to vote for her regardless of what she says.  Black Lives Matter folks obviously aren't going to vote for this batch of republicans over a democrat.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, she's also trying to court moderate and moderate-conservative whites, many of whom frankly don't really think black lives matter (unfortunate as that may be).  In sum, the protesters have no leverage because they have no options anyway, and Hilary is playing the right hand to get elected in a national setting.<br/><br/>Does that mean they don't have a point?  Probably not, but perhaps they should apply some strategic thinking as well, because at the end of the day their goals will be better served by electing basically any democrat regardless of whether they like the person or not; because the democratic platform is more supportive of the rights of minorities as it stands.  They're certainly justified in seeking answers, but they're only harming their own position in reality.<br/><br/>You don't always get everything you want in elections, and better to take the devil you know (who'll throw you some bones), than the devil you don't (who you're pretty sure won't).

The Draft Lottery destroyed us and destroyed our ability to support or oppose our country going to war.  We have created a three tiered society,  those that ignore service,  those that serve, and a third group that exploit the second with the passive approval of the first.  <br/><br/>The  "quiet killings and blurred lines" of Seal Team 6 is just one outcome.  So are the endless wars and the indecision that underlies them.<br/><br/>  As our country's infrastructure  continues to disintegrate and our relationships around the world sour,  we stand idly by.  <br/><br/>What a nightmare.

Unfortunately, Walker's history of lies is well known. He vowed he wouldn't go after unions and then after he was elected he did. He refused to answer last weekend about his role in formulating the repeal of open records laws in Wisconsin. And then his office admitted it was behind the effort. Do not be fooled. Just look at the destruction of Wisconsin's proud progressive tradition to find the truth.

And NK's cheating has put the world in danger of...what?

135
An issue not addressed is the relationship between a city's police and its Prosecutor. In killings not involving a police officer, the prosecutors office and the police department work as a team gathering evidence and testifying in court. When a policeman is charged with the unnecessary killing of a citizen these "team members" are on opposite sides and this has to have an affect on how aggressive the prosecutor tries the case.<br/><br/>This needs addressing.

Maybe they're the ones subsidizing YOU. They're making your food cheaper, they're paying taxes, they get no Social Security. And their children will be paying for your Medicare and Social Security benefits.

"The people who are making 100,00 to 250,000"??  Are you serious?  Forget the billionaires, let's attack the professional class, many of whom (unlike the Wall Street crowd) actually provide goods and services that are of value to society.  And the people in this income range often come from very middle class backgrounds; it's not like they are children of privilege.  Give me a break...

138
Sorry, but there is no such thing as "EU poverty standards". Each EU member state defines its own poverty level. It might be helpful to compare the standard of living for retirees.<br/><br/>Average Greek pension is over 660 euros/month, and including the supplementary the average gets to over 880 euros/month (just under $1,000). While it is lower than the average U.S. Social Security payment of $1,294, it is comparable to it. Then there is the issue of early retirement, which is endemic in Greece, while an able-bodied American cannot qualify for Social Security before age of 62. <br/><br/>In 2012 the average Greek pension was comfortable in the middle of the EU averages (I presume it came down since then). The German pensions were just one notch above it. Of course, they have the retirees of the former East Germany to care about.<br/><br/>The _minimum_ Greek pension is 450 euro/month (with the exception of Greek agricultural pensions, which could go as low as 300 euros/month). The _maximum_ pension in the neighboring fellow EU member state of Bulgaria is about the same -- 460 euros/month (it was 440 euros until last month). In fellow eurozone member Estonia the _average_ pension is lower than that -- 350 euros/month.<br/><br/>I understand it should not be a race to the bottom for the European retirees. However, if Estonian taxpayers are expected not only to lend a helping hand, but also to write off Greek debts, it is not fair that their retirees are expected to live on half of the Greek pensions.

Even as a fairly left leaning atheist, I am not so obtuse to the moral and philosophical implications of abortion that so many pro choice advocates are. They would have you believe that the unborn child's life has zero value even at the 39th week of gestation when it competes with the mother's will to avoid the pains of pregnancy and childbirth. Meanwhile, once the child just exits the birth canal, we would try the woman for capital murder if she killed the baby. I realize that this would be the rarest and most extreme case of an abortion but it should be obvious to anyone capable to think outside of black and white terms that the issue of abortion is a morally grey area no matter what your religious or political beliefs may be. I'm willing to compromise and allow abortions up through the end of the first trimester. This is when the fetus begins to resemble the human form and its brainwave patterns first emerge. Any abortion after that period should have a valid medical reason showing a threat to the mother's health if the pregnancy continues. I fail to see how one could possibly have any veneration for the sanctity of human life and at the same time not find the killing of a nearly fully developed unborn child morally reprehensible. In my personal opinion, the same individuals that are so often vehemently pro choice and oppose capital punishment are nothing short of despicable hypocrites.<br/>I would not say the Texas legislation prevents abortions but only protects the mother.

I have a PhD in Computer Technology in Education, was a senior computer banking executive for many years, and a computer technology university professor for more years later, and I wished the times the computers I had access to had been hacked by a human being and not simply failed because those humans failed.<br/>Foolishness, and not delinquency, has always been my anecdotal, if not my empirical, experience. The problem is that foolishness may cause more damage than delinquency sometimes. So when I see my personal computer misbehaving these days I wonder who the fool is, not which country is hacking.

I had a friend who was a volunteer for an AIDS organization in San<br/>Francisco during the early years of the epidemic.  During that time,<br/>she took a trip to Europe and spent an afternoon with some Dutch<br/>people.  She proudly told them about all the services her organization<br/>and others provided to people with AIDS:  meals, transportation to<br/>medical appointments, house cleaning, etc.  She was at a loss to<br/>interpret the embarrassed silence that greeted her enthusiasm.<br/>Finally, someone gently explained to her that in their country, all of<br/>these services were provided for free, paid for by taxes, to sick people,<br/>out of a national belief that in a society, you care for each other.<br/><br/>How I wish we lived in that society!  When I worked as an RN, I was<br/>often astonished at what family &amp; friends were expected to be able<br/>to do for the patient.  Sometimes the care required was quite complex,<br/>eg, complicated dressing changes or dealing with various tubes.<br/>Sometimes it was simple on the surface, but very difficult in reality,<br/>e.g., an elderly person expected to transfer their elderly spouse from<br/>the bed to a bedside chair, all alone at home.  I'll join my voice to<br/>others:  we desperately need a single-payer system in the US, a<br/>system that would provide what patients themselves actually need,<br/>including all the adjunct services like food preparation and cleaning.<br/>Unfortunately, tragically, even, we aren't there yet.

And may I suggest that you are dead wrong too.  A member of the NRA?  You are part of the problem.  You are supporting this group of people that have worked tirelessly to arm this nation with guns.  If people like yourself would resign, the NRA would lose the clout they now enjoy.  <br/><br/>Go ahead.  Make my day.  Resign the horrible NRA.

146
Incredibly well said! I agree on every point. 

147
It is disheartening to see such lack of nuance &amp; question begging on such an important issue as a clean environment.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, one can be concerned about the environment, and still question whether simply adding more &amp; more regulations is actually the answer. It is also possible to truly want clean air &amp; water, but ask whether the minimal improvement in some mandated emissions reductions is worth any cost whatsoever.<br/><br/>What's necessary is a real discussion of the costs, benefits *and* trade-offs of any &amp; all new or expanded laws. Not just lining up in lockstep behind any plan that says it is for a cleaner environment. Just saying it, doesn't make it so.

148
There is so much SO wrong with so much of what is reported in this article. I trust our government (and their corporate partners) as much as they apparently trust me and my co-citizens. We are not guilty. <br/><br/>Why is everyone suspect?<br/><br/>When will this end?

149
If I could recommend this comment a million times, I would. Thank you for saying what I was thinking as I was reading this. Women's lives - all women - seem to not matter one iota in this country. I only see it getting worse not better. The ignorance, arrogance and blatant misogyny that was on display in Cleveland last Thursday was infuriating and nauseating. I'd love to see Blow write an article about sexism in this country, it's worse than the racism and just as destructive.

"Hot money doesn't need ultra-low rates to be subject to enthusiasms and sudden losses of confidence."<br/><br/>I'm really worried about these "enthusiasms."  Are they as bad as "irrational exuberances"?

151
I can see where someone might do that as a young person who did not know any better, but once that phase has passed, why would anyone continue in a job they hated?  If you for some reason did continue, at least have the emotional honesty to admit that you have chosen this job.  That way you can be happy in your misery.

This is a fantastic summer salad. The Anaheim peppers give it a little kick but for someone who does not like too much heat they can push them to the side. The caraway seed gives it a nice additional flavor and we served it warm

I've also wondered if the therapist lets the client know the first time they meet that he/she might choose to write about the patient or if they bring it up a few years in when it would be more difficult for the patient to start over with someone new or risk the therapist's wrath by withholding consent. I do think there's value to these stories, but it also feels like the therapist is pimping out their clients' stories for self-aggrandizement and personal gain.

155
It seems that somewhere along the way in the world, we have lost the common sense logic..." you buy what you can afford." When did we decide that anything we want can be bought with credit ? What happened to that bit of character that put a mental lock on getting into debt ? Most everyone, now, is in "over their heads." I miss the days when people worked hard for a dollar, and didn't spend it foolishly. Perhaps it's time we rewind and look at the days when common sense WAS common.

156
Finally! Thank goodness....

There is nothing more threatening to a politically liberal college professor (it's redundant, I know) than competition and accountability.  <br/><br/>I applaud Walker's efforts to pierce that insulated protective bubble and I thank the voters of WI for supporting him, three times in a row.

My question is not about the main conclusion from the curves but about their form: has anybody here an explanation for why the curve for Latvia looks smoother than the one for Iceland?

Its clear thievery when the Hindu origins of yoga are denied-one to make it easier to claim its of European/Scandinavian/German origin. Its particularly double faced when coming from a civilization that otherwise demands patent and copyright protections for a hundred year old songs and a particular shade of red<br/>Hindus or yoga practitioner have never claimed non Hindus can not benefit from yoga, But we have seen too many times how our ideas are credited to others-the so called "Arabic" numerals being another example. Today millions of folks have no clue that Arab traders merely transported this concept from ancient Hindus to their European markets. Its important to ensure that yoga, ayurveda and others are not similarly misappropriated

Conservative hostility to this agreement is nothing new. G.O.P. hardliners denounced Nixon and Reagan's diplomatic achievements too.  And they were right, or do you love China and what it has done to the American economy and industrial manufacturing base?

To answer the last eight words of your comment:  Hilary could not handle the position of Secretary of State.  What makes you think she could handle the position of President of the United States?  Takes a lot more than bleaching your hair blonde.

I would love to read an article about this. Coming of age in the early '70s, when "women's lib" was just beginning, no guy wanted to marry a career woman. As our generation has aged, not much has changed. I have so many women friends in our 60s who have never married because the men we met needed to be superior to the women, financially as well as career-wise. As we near retirement, I don't see things changing. Which is too bad, because we all want relationships.

My child turned down two Ivies in favor of a state university honors program...and loved the experience of that wide world. They gave no scholarships, but there were wonderful classes, many special opportunities, and support when applying for national grad school scholarships.  After graduating debt free from undergrad,  then it was off to an Ivy League law school when the borrowing began. With the scholarships in hand that debt was so much less than it might have been. The state school honors program was the best thing that could have happened for our child.

I was having a bad day, so when I saw an unarmed 14 year old girl in a bathing suit sitting on the grass I couldn't help but violently grab her and, when she began to cry out for her mama, of course the first thing that occurred to me was to force her face down in the dirt and put my knee on her neck.  Oh, and when I saw a couple of other kids standing around while I did this, given my bad mood I really had no choice but to draw a loaded gun and wave it at them.  I mean heck, look on the bright side, I didn't blow those kids away, did I?<br/><br/>No, but watching that video, all I could think was that we were one twitch of a muscle away from losing one or more young lives to senseless gun violence, perpetrated by someone who believed he had a license to do whatever the heck he wanted to do, whenever he wanted to do it, to whomever he wanted to do it to.<br/><br/>If a civilian did what this man in uniform did, he would spend a bit of time in prison.  This guy should do the same -- no excuses. He was not at the scene to 'keep the peace.'  He was there to get his ya yas out. That's how many of the folks rotting in America's prisons got there.

166
The equivalent to this argument as far as I'm concerned is, after Pearl Harbour in 1941, ignore the attack, forget defence spending and building up the army, forget fighting back.  Build up education, produce more civilian goods, don't support England and Russia to roll back fascism and destroy its source.  And it may well have worked for a while, until the fascists came here to control North America...  In one sense, the current fascists are more egregious because they did come here, in 2001, and did something as bad or worse than Pearl Harbor, to innocent unsuspecting civilians.   And groups with the same way of thinking want to do the same again or worse (they have said so, e.g. ISIS).  Yet still one reads many comments along the lines of the one above.  Definitely a great puzzle, but I do believe the bulk of the people won't buy this analysis.  I do believe they understand and even Obama does, the importance of defending the country in ways that while not always easy or normally palatable, are preferable to the crude methods used 60 years ago, e.g. terror bombings of urban cities.

This is another example of the long conflict between religion and science. On one hand, there are people who dedicate their lives to advancing the knowledge of all mankind. On the other hand, there are people who believe in fairy tales.<br/><br/>I support the people who value reason, logic and progress. I support all the tireless work of the world's astronomers and cosmologists. I condemn the backward folks who are trying to stop science in the name of their foolish, baseless beliefs. 

169
Meanwhile, anyone working in an office knows that he will be collateral damage to these policies. The co-worker goes out for a few months, job protected, and the remaining folks get to do his work, and their own, for no additional compensation.

Memory Loss: It affects even Presidents. <br/><br/>GWB made several agreements with N Korea to get them to stop building nukes. Clinton did likewise. And yet NK has a nuke. <br/><br/>Anyone who believes this "deal" will prevent Iran from building a nuke is a "useful idiot" - someone who thinks the Middle East will become truly peaceful once America stops treating Iran like the pariah nation it is.<br/><br/>Iran has been at war with America since 1979, and hasn't let up for an instant. Americans are the only ones who refuse to see this. Iran's Islamic Constitution dictates they export their revolution until the whole world is Muslim. They are not giving up that goal, and nukes are a step for them in that direction. Believing otherwise, even as a Community Activist President, is just plain stupid.

The outcome of this vote is truly evil.  Many senators ignored the Americans who are truly pro life proponents. I am deeply saddened by so many who chose to sell out for the almighty dollar instead of doing what is right for the babies. I know that the videos won't stop coming and more needs to  be done to rectify this terrible wrong.

It's time for pitchers to wear protective headgear.

Right AN. Nothing is ever Mrs. Clinton's fault. She's a victim. If she wants to lead the nation she going to have to shed herself of that lifelong crutch. <br/><br/>But more to the point, go back and look at her campaign organization's strategy and tactics in the late 2008 primaries, especially in the smaller states, and let me know if you still think she kept her foot on the pedal. Be honest now!

176
A great series of articles with great impact.  Shine a light on the "back room boys" about their jerking the puppet strings to take advantage of the loops in the law and make a bit more profit and you find them slinking away when they see the profit threatened from a different direction.  Real American lives are being affected by the mis-application of what might otherwise have been a well intentioned law. There is absolutely nothing wrong with profit but when it is sought in such a dirty underhanded way one wishes for the resurection of "old Walt" to sweep them away and clean house.  It is great that there is a potential to clean some of the "dirt" out of another house up on a hill in DC and shine some light in the corners there.  The law makers won't fix it unless they feel the heat to do so.

China is like a bull in a china shop.   Watch out world because unfortunately they do matter because of their size.  Hopefully China will stop with the fixed currency  rates, but I seriously doubt they will ever give up on manipulating the market to their advantage.

178
I basically agree with what you write, but I don't see the downside.  If this entire part of the world shrivels and dries up with no cost of more American lives, I would see it as a good deal.  As far as having that so called "civilization" lost. I say it is already lost.  Good riddance.  <br/><br/>"If you don't get what you want. want what you need".

Strange that she says "I can't be seen as white and be Izaiah's mom." Really? Where does that leave biracial children of white mother's and father's? She seems to want to pick and choose what suits her disguise. How does she explain suing Howard University, an historically black university, on the basis of being discriminated against because she is white? Is that really something that a person who identifies as black and sees herself as a black civil rights advocate would do? Not to mention fabricating racial threats and pretending that a black man is her father.This is not about how she sees herself. It's about purposely choosing to pretend to be black to gain  attention and being a fraud and a liar while appropriating a false history and personal story for her own benefit. It's all very disturbing.

The Union of Concerned Scientists has numerous objections to major GMO food crops currently being used in the US.<br/><br/>The science of GMOs and scientists worldwide have concerns about them.<br/><br/>Would have me believe only the scientists who agree with you and with GMO proponents?<br/><br/>Don't be disheartened.  Great science happens when people probe and when what seems obvious is anything but.

Richard, this guy (Krugman) is absolutely brilliant.  Beyond all natural recognition, this is unreal.  I really believe it.<br/><br/>How do I know this?  It is secret.  All my life, I knew I was smarter than 99% of the population.  How do you act normal?<br/><br/>It is a way of life.

If one examines the graphic posted in a series of Times articles showing the total amount of trade between the 12 countries involved in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, you'll discover that it really is a new NAFTA with 75 percent of the trade involving Canada and Mexico, and with half of the remaining trade with Japan.  The question is: Why do we need a new NAFTA when the consensus is that the old one was a disaster for the American worker?  Contrary to the rosy scenario Mr. Brooks paints, Mexico lost it agricultural base after NAFTA leading to an influx of illegal immigrants and now is a narco-state almost totally in control of drug gangs.  What the Democrats in Congress have been urging President Obama to do is to live up to his mantra of bringing "transparency" to government.  Why should anyone sign off on something this important that's classified with key details unknown when all such prior agreements have benefited the few multinational corporations at the expense of the many?  It's time for Mr. Obama to at least list the "core principles" in the agreement that will benefit and protect the vanishing middle-class that are the base of his party.  And, it's time for Congress to stop giving any President a blank check, euphemistically, called "fast track authority," to negotiate secret trade deals without any input from our elected representatives. Isn't that what the original tea party was all about?

183
The CA law is not just about public schools—also affects private schools, but has no impact on any other "public" places (parks, theaters, etc.).<br/>Whereas with the previous law parents were encouraged to talk to their doctor if they had concerns about vaccines, the current law uses a paternalist approach to avoid conversations about parents' concerns.

184
You left out banning lobbies.   No other democracy allows/legalizes lobbies of the type &amp; scale as the USA. Imagine what a lobby free USA would be like. No invasion of Iraq (sponsored by AIPACers lies) a single-payer ,universal healthcare system (that could have been paid for with the $3 trillion cost of the Iraq invasion) no controversy in Congress over the Iran deal (no AIPAC pushing for a US war with Iran) etc , etc.

185
Amen.

Yes, roberts is a political horsetrader. He is trading votes all the time, with complete distegard for precedent.  Stangle the politicized federal courts in the best way possible, stave the, of money and prevent them from functioning. 

187
You are correct, but the Bentley-driving shareholders of the insurance companies, hospitals, and other health-rackets (Cough... Radiology...) won't like that at all.  <br/><br/>You'll be told that it's "socialist".  Well, excuse me while I go have my world-class socialist cancer-treatment, or have my socialist back-surgery and the rehab, for the entirely reasonable sum of 2% of my taxable income.  Sickness or surgery without filing for bankruptcy, here in this socialist paradise called Australia.  It's a joy you'll never know in the USA, because you have too many people getting too rich off your healthcare rackets.

I think President Obama fairly and honestly represented who he is in "Audacity of Hope". He has acted as I expected after reading his book.

Privatization is a key component of the economic warfare waged under the banner of austerity. It is what ultimately got the IMF kicked out of Latin America and is the handwriting on the wall that should speak clearly to the Greeks that leaving the EU now, while it still owns its beaches and what remains of its national industries, is the only alternative that remains. <br/><br/>Once rich Germans own these, economic sovereignty will never be possible for Greece again. Austerity is the transnational equivalent of a PayDay loan, a straw in the heart of the Greek nation through which its life blood will be sucked by German banks forever.

Dave -- Hitler was completely motivated by religion targeting JEWS as scapegoats as a means to rally his recruits and create a common enemy for them. Of course there were others in the mix - not denying that - gypsies, gays, mentally ill and others. I have not heard it mentioned if Jewish Women were raped by Nazis and their cohorts but would it surprise you if it had occurred? 

191
There are also many elite small liberal arts colleges that are just as expensive as Harvard or Yale.  People go to these colleges for small classes, highly selective student body, and top professors who are oriented towards teaching undergrads.  This may be a good choice for some students who have enough money to pay the stiff fees.

As a recent tourist to NYC, staying in the Times Square area, I did happen to notice the desnudas. At first I was quite surprised, then later, amused.  I suppose if I had young children with me, maybe I'd be more concerned about how to explain the girls to the kids, but otherwise, really, who cares? We as a country need to be less hung-up on public nudity and a little more concerned with the problems listed here, such as homelessness, poverty, unemployment, etc. <br/><br/>I was much more offended by the hucksters relentlessly trying to get me to take a bus tour than I was by the various street performers.  Now, a naked bus tour... that would be a different story.

193
It's becoming painfully obvious that getting a deal -- even a bad one -- is so important to the President's legacy that our national interests are being ignored.

Is it so difficult to connect the dots to figure out what part of the problem is? The NY Times even publishes an article about part of the problem:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/chicago-schools-chief-resigns-amid-federal-investigation.html?ref=us" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/chicago-schools-chief-resigns-amid-federal-investigation.html?ref=us" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/chicago-schools-chief-resigns-amid-...</a>

It is shameful for Brooks to write on this subject.  He supported the misguided war in the first place.  Without George Bush's disingenuous invasion of Iraq, without support from columnists like Brooks, without Bush's stupid, Oedipal, misguided war there would likely be no Isis.  Shame on you Brooks for even thinking you have a right to speak on this subject.  On this issue you should bury your head in the sand and keep quiet.

So the line to return social security checks along with other "socialist" middle-class entitlements forms right behind you. Is that it?

China's phenomenal economic past performance allowed the leaders to maintain a tight grip on individual freedoms. As the economy's growth becomes closer to normal the citizens will be less patient with the lack of individual freedoms and rights. Let's hope the transition will be peaceful. <br/><br/>I recently read a section of the May/June 2015 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine called China Now and much, but not all, of what is written below is based on that publication. For those with an interest in China it is worth reading.<br/><br/>It is said by the ruling class that postmodern China was governed by "heavenly sanctioned" principles depicting the best way to be human. Other nations could live by the same principles but they could never be like the Chinese in defining what is proper and having society comply with such teachings.<br/><br/>From a Chinese perspective being Chinese means to practice proper behavior and to be a part of a civilization that is better than the rest of the world. The discussion amongst Chinese in today's times is what values should their race stand for. Our hope is they get spoiled by the freedoms we have. The Chinese government's hope is if they treat their citizens like a good father they will continue to rule. My observation is even the child that obeys all orders from the father wants to live his own life....  <a href="http://lstrn.us/1MjPlJ4" title="http://lstrn.us/1MjPlJ4" target="_blank">http://lstrn.us/1MjPlJ4</a>

me not frugal, it's interesting that you demonstrated such poor reading comprehension in your reply to Chris.  Chris did not say that "everyone else was wrong", Chris pointed out that some questions on the test had more than one plausible answer and seemed designed only to insure that some people -- no matter how well educated they were -- would pick one of the wrong answers.  That is how you get an artificially high failure rate and why suburban parents are opting out.  Their kids are reading high level books and understanding them and doing well on the SATs and other exams that ALL students -- not just those in public school -- take.  But they are supposed to believe that because their teachers haven't been drumming "how to pick the best of two terrible answers" into their child's head, their schools are failures. Sorry, if these tests were meaningful, you'd see private school parents DEMANDING that their school give them to their kids so they could make sure they were being taught properly.  LOL!  Never.

199
When you talk, your thoughts aren't going to always be constantly formulated. Instead of having pauses that are awkwardly silent, you use the words "kind of," "sort of," or "um" as natural fillers while you recall what else you were going to say next. I think sometimes they are effective because it helps with quickening your speech in daily conversations. However, in more serious matters, overusing would, of course, make you sound as though you lack clarity and confidence.
